    "# Sentiment Analysis using VADER\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment Analysis or Opinion Mining is a sub-field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that tries to identify and extract opinions within a given text. The aim of sentiment analysis is to gauge the attitude, sentiments, evaluations, attitudes and emotions of a speaker/writer based on the computational treatment of subjectivity in a text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though it may seem easy on paper, Sentiment Analysis is actually a tricky subject. There are various reasons for that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understanding emotions through text are not always easy. Sometimes even humans can get misled.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- A text may contain multiple sentiments all at once. For instance, “The intent behind the movie was great, but it could have been better”. This sentence consists of two polarities, i.e., Positive as well as Negative. So how do we conclude whether the review was Positive or Negative?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Computers aren’t too comfortable in comprehending Figurative Speech. Figurative language uses words in a way that deviates from their conventionally accepted definitions in order to convey a more complicated meaning or heightened effect. Use of similes, metaphors, hyperboles etc qualify for a figurative speech: “The best I can say about the movie is that it was interesting.” Here, the word ’interesting’ does not necessarily convey positive sentiment and can be confusing for algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Heavy use of emoticons and slangs with sentiment values in social media texts like that of Twitter and Facebook also makes text analysis difficult. For example a “ :)” denotes a smiley and generally refers to positive sentiment while “:(” denotes a negative sentiment on the other hand. Also, acronyms like “LOL“, ”OMG” and commonly used slangs like “Nah”, “meh”, ”giggly” etc are also strong indicators of some sort of sentiment in a sentence.\n"

    "**VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)** belongs to a type of sentiment analysis that is based on lexicons of sentiment-related words. In this approach, each of the words in the lexicon is rated as to whether it is positive or negative, and in many cases, how positive or negative. Below you can see an excerpt from VADER’s lexicon, where more positive words have higher positive ratings and more negative words have lower negative ratings.\n",

    "tragedy\t    -3.4\n",
    "rejoiced   \t 2.0\n",

    "disaster   \t-3.1\n",
    "great\t       3.1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To work out whether these words are positive or negative (and optionally, to what degree), the developers of these approaches need to get a bunch of people to manually rate them, which is obviously pretty expensive and time-consuming. In addition, the lexicon needs to have good coverage of the words in your text of interest, otherwise it won’t be very accurate. On the flipside, when there is a good fit between the lexicon and the text, this approach is accurate, and additionally quickly returns results even on large amounts of text."

      "A Dud... I just got word from my sis in law that the heli we sent my nephew for Christmas is a dud. How sad... He really was looking fwd to this gift. The box seal was broken upon arrival and my sis said it looks like it might have been opened, but she would wrap it and give it to him anyways and turns out it doesnt even work. We purchased this from SVM but it was fulfilled through Amazon (I recently just read some knock off Syma helicopters were being sold through here so I wonder if ours was one or if it was truly a dud) and they have initiated a refund for us and sent out a new one already. So I give Amazon 5 stars for the effort! I hope the new one works. \n",

      "Terrible for young would-be readers This toy would have been good for youngsters if they had simply used lower-case letters.  Unfortunately, focusing exclusively on the upper-case alphabet is disastrous for those learning to read.LeapFrog forces you to buy an expansion pack to get the lower-case letters, an extra hidden expense.  However, most parents either will receive this as a gift or won't realize when buying it that the expansion pack exists, or may not know that teaching a child to recognize only upper-case letters is actually a DETRIMENT to early reading ability.Many upper-case letters bear little or no resemblance to their lower-case counterparts.  Almost all text is printed in lower-case, with the occasional upper-case letter to start a sentence or proper noun.  This means that a young one who wants to start sounding out words around her is best served by learning lower-case letters first.  In fact, learning the upper-case alphabet comes as a free bonus to a young learner.  (For example, reading the word \"The\" at the start of a sentence will teach a young reader about capital T, since in context the word will be easy to recognize.)Apart from the fact that LeapFrog only ships upper-case letters in order to increase your total purchase price, the implementation of the toy is suboptimal.  Each letter is presented with a maximum of two sounds.  This has caused some confusion with my 3-year-old, since letters like \"a\" have more sounds that pop up in common early reading words.In addition, the sounds are presented in a worthlessly sappy-cute way: \"'T' goes [t]; 't' goes [t].  Every letter makes a sound.  'T' goes 't'.\"  It would have been much more helpful to just have each common sound fully represented, and not have to listen to the whole spiel.  The common repetition cannot enhance recollection at all.Buy or recommend this set only with the caveat that the expansion pack with lower case letters must also be purchased, and the upper-case letters stored away.  Otherwise, the recipient child will wind up able to read all-caps titles and banners, and little else. \n",

      "Concerned about possible use of harmful chemicals My son received this toy as a gift for his 6-month birthday. At the time, I remember hearing about how some plastic toys (often made in China) contain harmful chemicals that are known to cause cancer and feeling concerned that this toy might be one of them. I didn't do anything for awhile, seeing how my son enjoyed playing with the toy and thinking (stupidly) that if this toy were truly harmful, it wouldn't be sold in the U.S.One day, I came across this toy on Amazon and noticed the warning to CA residents under \"Product Details.\" I couldn't believe it when I read this toy is made with harmful chemicals known to \"cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm.\" I bet a lot of people who are giving this toy 5 stars are not aware of the warning.UPDATE TO REVIEW ON 10-28-09: Amazon has removed the warning about the harmful chemicals, and in response to an inquiry I sent them told me \"Product information from the item detail is added or deleted upon manufacturers information.\" Amazon suggested I contacted FP, which I did, and the FP rep said he couldn't find anything in their records indicating the toy's manufacturing had been changed. The toy's production has not been altered since 2007. He suggested that perhaps the warning wasn't accurate, and that's why it was removed. That may be, but it seems like a pretty big mistake for Amazon to make on multiple FP toys. I see now that none of the FP toys that previously had this warning have it now.As for my son's reaction to the toy, he liked to bang the pieces together and put them in his mouth, but he never bothered to try to sort the shapes since the top doesn't stay in place, as others have mentioned. My son always removed the top and took out all of the pieces, no matter how many times I showed him how to sort the shapes with the top in place. Talk about poor design! I should have given it 1 star for the \"educational\" rating in hindsight, but I figured that theoretically it could be of some value if a child didn't remove the top. Also, Amazon wouldn't let me go back and change my ratings.I just got another shape sorter for him from Amazon (the Tolo Rolling Shape Sorter), and within minutes he tried to put the shapes in the slots because he couldn't remove either the top or the bottom of the unit. Now that's an educational toy! \n",

      "Sharp edges on metal latches & the one I received was covered in saw dust This one is hard to rate b/c I agree w/ all the other reviewers that this is a fun toy; however, I have safety concerns that some might want to know about.After reading the reviews (thank you as I realy on these) & being a Melissa & Doug fan, I was excited about this board.  I am rating this low b/c first off, the whole board looked to be covered in saw dust or something which was very strange.Normally, Melissa & Doug items are great, but on this the metal edges on the latches seem very sharp & potentially dangerous.  The board is also pretty heavy so depending on the age of your child(ren) this could be an issue (ironically the nice part of it being heavy is that it is probably more durable).As many others have reviewed, I do think this is a fun toy & something they want to play with, but due to it being covered in sawdust & having sharp metal edges I think it is dangerous & would not recommend.  Maybe I received a used or defective board, but wanted to share especially about the metal latches being sharp.Overall, it is a fun toy no question as a lot of the other reviewers say, but safety is most important & I would not recommend this item. \n",

      "A blight on party games I understand that I am swimming against the tide here.  In the interest of full disclosure, I would rather play a game ofTroyes Board GameorMerkatorbefore pretty much any party game, but I also enjoy quality party games such asDixit,Balderdash, or evenCrappy Birthday.  Those party games at least encourage some level of creative thinking and strategy, and Dixit and Balderdash have elegant scoring mechanics which encourage a certain level of strategy.Apples to Apples has none of this.  The random card selection forces the players into prefabricated \"hilarious\" answers, and even taking the approach of playing one non sequitur answer after another can get rather tedious.  The totally arbitrary way in which the judge selects the winning card hardly helps.  It becomes impossible to formulate any coherent strategy.  Having people plead their case before the judge guarantees that the game either becomes a popularity contest or a situation where the loudest person in the room gets his/her way.There are better games out there, folks.  I have listed a few of them for your benefit.  Check them out.  It's a shame that a game as dull and uninspired as Apples to Apples has enjoyed the success that it has. \n",

      "Do not buy! My daughter received this for Christmas. The idea is that a shape or letter is clearly displayed and the child traces it. Great concept! However, the design is poorly executed. The &#34;tracing&#34; part is like those little boards you write on with a plastic pen and lift it up to clear it. It doesn't work. My daughter tries to trace and it does not register her trace. I try to trace by pushing down HARD and it kind of registers my trace.My recommendation: save your money. I wish we didn't toss the box, because I would ask Grandma to return it. \n",

      "WRITING DISAPPEARS BEFORE YOUR EYES AS YOU'RE WRITING IT!! Just bought this at Walmart today (same price, by the way) and was so excited (as was my daughter), since she's just learning how to write her letters! SOUNDED like a great idea, but when we tried it, NONE OF THE WRITING/DRAWING STAYED ON THE SCREEN!!!!!!!!! And I don't mean AFTER you've written it - I mean WHILE you're actually writing it!! The screen is NOT a touchscreen (like ipad or ipod) - it's just a piece of flimsy SOFT plastic over a hard plastic screen underneath, so you can easily see that the screen, with continued use, will wear out quickly, especially since the kids (and adults who TRY to make it work!) will be PRESSING SO HARD to TRY to make the writing stay!! YOU'RE BETTER OFF BUYING ONE OF THOSE CHEAPIE DOLLAR STORE-TYPE WIPE-OFF SLATES (which have the same cheap plastic writing surface - I actually HAVE one of these and it works BETTER than this screen does!!) OR A DRY ERASE LETTER WRITING BOOKLET OR JUST PENCILS AND PAPER!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY, AND DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE!!!!!!!!!! \n",

      "Bad Bunch So I received 3 of these for Christmas- yeah I know. My daughter's name is Violet so everyone went out and bought this for her. Well 2 out of the 3 are possessed. I programed them all and send them to different family members houses. Well...what it does is it will play the same intermission* song over and over and it's crazy! I take the batteries out and it will work fine for 2 mins then do it again!! I thought it was weird when the first one did that, BUT then the second one that is over her grandma's house did the same thing!!  I emailed the company and they told me to \"reset\" the dog and put new batteries in. Well that doesn't help at all, so now it sits around like every other stuffed animal. But it is a cute toy and we love it when it does work. \n",

      "It's a toy, with little educational value This is a toy that makes noise, and I did not particularly find this toy useful or educational. It focused more on the play, rather than the education. If anything, it prepares our little ones to use a touch-screen device (iphones, mp3 players, ipads, etc). Tag a part of the book and the pen talks or makes noise. This is not a bad thing, but it is also not educational IMHO. The best way to take advantage of this Tag Reading System is to use it with the child. That way, the child can ask questions and you can provide answers. Also, it requires a PC computer to add or change books.  It is not compatible with Mac, which others have reported.  Other than that, I thought this toy is sub-par (though fun for children), and I do not find it to have any educational value or potential. \n",

      "So sorry I bought! I was so excited to buy this product, thinking it would improve my grandchildren's skills and interest in reading.  I also bought nearly $100 worth of the TAG books to go with the pen. I gave it to the grandkids for Christmas, not realizing it couldn't be used right out of the box.  But, okay, lots of toys need batteries, etc., so I thought no big deal. However, that was not the issue.  The fine print on the TAG reader and all of the books says none of the items can be used until you download the Leapfrog TAG system onto your computer and then you have to find and download each and every book one at a time. Great--- my home computer is a little outdated so the download would not work. I had to go to someone elses computer and put the books on the pen, and will have to do that each time a new book is purchased.  The pen, straight from the box, needed an \"update\" as soon as it was connected to the computer, as well. The entire process took about 2 hours.  I would never have bought this had I known it needed internet access on a new OS.I called the Leapfrog customer service line 3 days in a row to see if they offered downloads for my older computer, but NEVER spoke to anyone. The first day, I stayed on hold 67 minutes. Day 2, 55 minutes. Day 3, I stayed on hold until the battery died in my cordless and no one ever answered, even though my \"call was very important\" and \"the next available operator\" would help me. I wish I hadn't discarded the packaging; it would definitley have been a return! \n",

      "Far Too Noisy For Indoor Play Kids love to play camping- both indoors and out, so I thought this was a cute idea for something different to do for them with our- almost every day is raining- weather we have been having here in Ohio. The children have always put 2 chairs apart and thrown a blanket over them for an instant tent with our lantern inside for some imaginative indoor camping fun. I thought this would add to their indoor fun- bringing camping inside- since it's wet outdoors here about 9 months out of the year now.The log looks cute. It has a cloth flame that moves from a fan inside, to look like a flickering fire. It has a light inside that makes a slight glowing on the top of the log. It runs on 4 AA batteries. Once we turned it on, the light is very dull and the fan that blows the cloth flame is too loud in an annoying way- like when we use our hedgeclippers outdoors. It's a sound that of course isn't as loud as hedgeclippers- but it is loud- way too loud for indoors.I can't imagine why they didn't use a quiet fan- like the mini ones they make for just blowing air on your face in the summer. It makes no sense to use such a rackety one that ruins the calm of a fire. As for the light, they need a light that glows brighter, so the kids can see in the dark- like by a real fire. A quiet fan and brighter light that the kids can make hand shadows by, would have made this cute idea a hit, but as it is- the noisiness is just too much for indoor play which makes it useless. \n",

      "buy an ipad for your kid instead first of all I regret buying it but my son loves it. and a lot of the apps are very fun and full of great learning concepts but  I don't like 3 main things:1. the apps are too expensive - In reading reviews before purchasing this, I don't remember anyone mentioning how expensive the apps are. I can't figure out how this can stay competitive on a market like this with all the other tablet options for kids. on average most apps are like $7 versus $.99 for apps with an ipad. and you have to buy the apps constantly; actually you have to buy them like weekly because the kids go through the apps like a thirsty person drinks water in the desert. the apps should be $2-3 at the most.  Some are $25! just robbery! capitalism at it's worst2. everything you need for the thing is, of course, sold separately.  it only runs on batteries for maybe 2-3 hours so either buy rechargeable ones or you are spending a lot in batteries every few days. the charger and the headphones and the case are all separate and each costs about $20 a piece. just robbery! thievery! if we are paying $100 for the gadget, everything should be included. by the time you pay for the device, the apps, and the attachments, you would have a brand new ipad. in fact, it's cheaper to buy an ipad and buy $.99 apps than buy this thing.3. this device does not have Wi-Fi. I knew it didn't when I bought it but didn't realize how burdensome it would be to constantly download things from my computer to this game system. it's like I'm spending more time downloading the software and apps that it's making more work for me and less fun for my son. \n",

      "So not worth it - maybe 1.5 stars My five-year-old daughter has been wanting a Leap Pad for about six months now since she played her cousin's, so I was happy to get the opportunity to try this one.  Boy am I glad we didn't spend money on it.The good points of this device begin and end with the ease of set up.  Out of the box, the Leap Pad will be ready to use in about ten minutes of hooking up to the internet and downloading from the Leap Frog website.When my daughter first got the Leap Pad, she dove right into it and played most of the rest of the day, pausing only when we insisted that she give her older sister a turn to satisfy her curiosity.  I was relieved that finally she won't be pestering me for my smartphone all the time.After playing with it again the next day for less than an hour, however, my daughter asked me for my phone again.  By the end of the week she had practically forgotten about the Leap Pad and was right back with the phone.  While giving in and letting her borrow my phone, I decided to see what this Leap Pad is all about.  Didn't take me more than 5 minutes to want my phone back.The package includes nine apps when you initially connect to the Leap Frog website.  Among these are a decent art program, a pet corner and a game that \"teaches\" the flags and various random useless facts about countries the majority of adults have never heard of.  There is also a calculator, a clock and a couple other apps your average preschooler will never touch.  To the extent she has used it at all since the initial days, my daughter only uses the pet and art apps.The package also includes a $20 download card in order to load more programs from the Leap Frog website.  At first I was pretty impressed.  The apps range from $5 and up and you get a discount the more apps you buy.  The apps include games, videos, ebooks and other sorts of \"educational\" material.  I was able to get five apps, so I was pretty happy.  At first the new apps didn't download to the device properly and my daughter couldn't find them, but my husband hooked the device back up to the internet and the problem resolved itself.The problem is, the apps are junk.  The games are very simplistic and repetitive.  Among the games we got, there were two themes.  Three of the games involved inserting missing pieces to create a complete tube or waterslide to get from one end of a path to the other.  Two of the games involved patterns of moving objects out of the way to \"free\" something (a polar bear, for instance).  The one ebook we got was insulting, even for a preschooler's cognitive level and my daughter didn't want to touch it again.I'm sure our mistake was choosing the cheaper alternatives.  I'm guessing that the apps that cost $20 and up may hold your child's attention better.  But who wants to spend that kind of money on a child's toy that already costs nearly $100?  It's just a continual black hole sucking money straight out of your wallet.  You can also choose cartridges which can at least be shared among friends, but they are also expensive and are probably easily lost.Once you set up the device and register your child(ren), Leap Frog will send you periodic updates regarding your child's \"progress\".  This is to give further credibility to Leap Pad as an \"educational learning tool\".  The fact is, however, there is little that is educational about this or any other electronic gadget.  Memorizing facts is not \"learning\".  Age appropriate learning for a preschooler involves hands-on exploration and discovery, pretend play, engagement with parents and other adults, as well as interaction with peers.  None of that is offered - and, in fact, is stilted - by isolated, controlled \"play\" on a gadget.In any case, in this modern world, electronic gadgets may be nearly unavoidable.  If you really think your youngster needs a gadget, a simple small tablet would probably be a better option.  There are plenty of free games and other apps for tablets.  It may not look as inviting and \"child-friendly\" as this device with its two extra styluses and Doc McStuffins wallpaper, but it's a much better deal in the long run.Update 3/13/14:  Two other things I forgot to mention.  First, the Leap Pad is equipped with a camera, but it takes such bad pictures, your child will probably not want to use this feature more than once.  Second, on the pet app, your child can wash his/her pet which involves, among other things, blowing into part of the device to dry off the pet, which the kids think is fun, but I find a bit bizarre.  I don't know whether the germ factor bothers me more (especially since it's designed to be shared among up to three kids) or the fact that it's eerily like a breathalyzer. \n",
