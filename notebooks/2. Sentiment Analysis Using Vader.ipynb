    "# Sentiment Analysis using VADER\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment Analysis or Opinion Mining is a sub-field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that tries to identify and extract opinions within a given text. The aim of sentiment analysis is to gauge the attitude, sentiments, evaluations, attitudes and emotions of a speaker/writer based on the computational treatment of subjectivity in a text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though it may seem easy on paper, Sentiment Analysis is actually a tricky subject. There are various reasons for that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understanding emotions through text are not always easy. Sometimes even humans can get misled.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- A text may contain multiple sentiments all at once. For instance, “The intent behind the movie was great, but it could have been better”. This sentence consists of two polarities, i.e., Positive as well as Negative. So how do we conclude whether the review was Positive or Negative?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Computers aren’t too comfortable in comprehending Figurative Speech. Figurative language uses words in a way that deviates from their conventionally accepted definitions in order to convey a more complicated meaning or heightened effect. Use of similes, metaphors, hyperboles etc qualify for a figurative speech: “The best I can say about the movie is that it was interesting.” Here, the word ’interesting’ does not necessarily convey positive sentiment and can be confusing for algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Heavy use of emoticons and slangs with sentiment values in social media texts like that of Twitter and Facebook also makes text analysis difficult. For example a “ :)” denotes a smiley and generally refers to positive sentiment while “:(” denotes a negative sentiment on the other hand. Also, acronyms like “LOL“, ”OMG” and commonly used slangs like “Nah”, “meh”, ”giggly” etc are also strong indicators of some sort of sentiment in a sentence.\n"

    "**VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)** belongs to a type of sentiment analysis that is based on lexicons of sentiment-related words. In this approach, each of the words in the lexicon is rated as to whether it is positive or negative, and in many cases, how positive or negative. Below you can see an excerpt from VADER’s lexicon, where more positive words have higher positive ratings and more negative words have lower negative ratings.\n",

    "disaster   \t-3.1\n",
    "great\t       3.1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To work out whether these words are positive or negative (and optionally, to what degree), the developers of these approaches need to get a bunch of people to manually rate them, which is obviously pretty expensive and time-consuming. In addition, the lexicon needs to have good coverage of the words in your text of interest, otherwise it won’t be very accurate. On the flipside, when there is a good fit between the lexicon and the text, this approach is accurate, and additionally quickly returns results even on large amounts of text."

      "A blight on party games I understand that I am swimming against the tide here.  In the interest of full disclosure, I would rather play a game ofTroyes Board GameorMerkatorbefore pretty much any party game, but I also enjoy quality party games such asDixit,Balderdash, or evenCrappy Birthday.  Those party games at least encourage some level of creative thinking and strategy, and Dixit and Balderdash have elegant scoring mechanics which encourage a certain level of strategy.Apples to Apples has none of this.  The random card selection forces the players into prefabricated \"hilarious\" answers, and even taking the approach of playing one non sequitur answer after another can get rather tedious.  The totally arbitrary way in which the judge selects the winning card hardly helps.  It becomes impossible to formulate any coherent strategy.  Having people plead their case before the judge guarantees that the game either becomes a popularity contest or a situation where the loudest person in the room gets his/her way.There are better games out there, folks.  I have listed a few of them for your benefit.  Check them out.  It's a shame that a game as dull and uninspired as Apples to Apples has enjoyed the success that it has. \n",

      "It's a toy, with little educational value This is a toy that makes noise, and I did not particularly find this toy useful or educational. It focused more on the play, rather than the education. If anything, it prepares our little ones to use a touch-screen device (iphones, mp3 players, ipads, etc). Tag a part of the book and the pen talks or makes noise. This is not a bad thing, but it is also not educational IMHO. The best way to take advantage of this Tag Reading System is to use it with the child. That way, the child can ask questions and you can provide answers. Also, it requires a PC computer to add or change books.  It is not compatible with Mac, which others have reported.  Other than that, I thought this toy is sub-par (though fun for children), and I do not find it to have any educational value or potential. \n",

      "PROBLEMS. PROBLEMS. PROBLEMS. I got this toy at the store, came home, tried to set it up, make work with books..two hours later I am at square one.Now I see that there is a review here that exactly points to what is the deal with this toy and the deal is tha it is not out of the can openandplay toy.You need so much time to set it up, so many steps, connect it to the computerand all that you go gray haired before you finished.I think this is by far the most irritating toy of the year! at least it got my vote.It might work perfect but I did not pass the instalation, initiation and setting up an account process that asked me for my date of birth, my child date of birth, my address and what not.. and then it asked me for half of my family email addresses.. not to mention mine.I see where they are getting with it but I do not need it.I am not going to go through this \"insane\" instalation process every book I add to it,and clearly it did not came preloaded with info nor the books are so easy to download as one might think.It is unncessarly complciated. and It goes back to the store.. after very close call of going to the garbage instead. Yes, this thing can bring the best in you.There is a very good theree starr or so review of this toy that will give you an exactpicture of what is involved. If I knew it beofore I would not bother.There is so many better toys that do not make a parent to be a slave of technology.This company does not realise how little time parents have and how much time this toy consumes in order to work. This is very bad trade off. And this whole insane rewarding system that makes you run for  your computer every few minutes, look for connection cable and connect thing?do you really need all that? and btw.. you can't opt out of it so you will have to follow the rewarding system to make the toy go back to work and read the book.how many paper bookmarks might your child need or enjoy if they win one every few minutes?okay considered yourself warned. \n",

      "DO NOT Stick, DO NOT Flip Good, DO NOT Buy! I'm usually pretty happy with M&D products, but this one fails completely IMO. I was excited when it arrived, but the moment I flipped open the pad and tried to peel off one of the &#34;stickers&#34; for my 20mth old daughter, I knew this was a bad investment. Firstly, like many reviewers had commented negatively - these are NOT stickers because they don't stick or shall I say they don't have adhesive in the back as you'd normally find in ordinary stickers. I understand these are re-usable but they still should stick more like stickers than vinyl. Yes, they feel like some sort of thin filmy plastic or vinyl material and will only stay on the special surface of the pad if you press it down hard and smooth out the edges. It is easy to crush under little hands so be prepared to throw out a lot of damaged ones. Another frustrating feature is the pad being a flip-over type, hence each time you've got to exhaust yourself flipping back and forth between &#34;stickers&#34; and scenes. I'd prefer they separate the &#34;stickers&#34; from the pad. Spiral binding will work more effectively for excited, impatient toddlers who couldn't be bothered to sift through the pages to get to the specific &#34;stickers&#34; and scenes they are working on. Lastly, it gets boring pretty fast. Overall, I wouldn't buy this again. Save your $$$ and get a real sticker book even if you couldn't move them around as many times as you'd like. I wouldn't recommend to anyone I know. \n",

      "Far Too Noisy For Indoor Play Kids love to play camping- both indoors and out, so I thought this was a cute idea for something different to do for them with our- almost every day is raining- weather we have been having here in Ohio. The children have always put 2 chairs apart and thrown a blanket over them for an instant tent with our lantern inside for some imaginative indoor camping fun. I thought this would add to their indoor fun- bringing camping inside- since it's wet outdoors here about 9 months out of the year now.The log looks cute. It has a cloth flame that moves from a fan inside, to look like a flickering fire. It has a light inside that makes a slight glowing on the top of the log. It runs on 4 AA batteries. Once we turned it on, the light is very dull and the fan that blows the cloth flame is too loud in an annoying way- like when we use our hedgeclippers outdoors. It's a sound that of course isn't as loud as hedgeclippers- but it is loud- way too loud for indoors.I can't imagine why they didn't use a quiet fan- like the mini ones they make for just blowing air on your face in the summer. It makes no sense to use such a rackety one that ruins the calm of a fire. As for the light, they need a light that glows brighter, so the kids can see in the dark- like by a real fire. A quiet fan and brighter light that the kids can make hand shadows by, would have made this cute idea a hit, but as it is- the noisiness is just too much for indoor play which makes it useless. \n",

      "So not worth it - maybe 1.5 stars My five-year-old daughter has been wanting a Leap Pad for about six months now since she played her cousin's, so I was happy to get the opportunity to try this one.  Boy am I glad we didn't spend money on it.The good points of this device begin and end with the ease of set up.  Out of the box, the Leap Pad will be ready to use in about ten minutes of hooking up to the internet and downloading from the Leap Frog website.When my daughter first got the Leap Pad, she dove right into it and played most of the rest of the day, pausing only when we insisted that she give her older sister a turn to satisfy her curiosity.  I was relieved that finally she won't be pestering me for my smartphone all the time.After playing with it again the next day for less than an hour, however, my daughter asked me for my phone again.  By the end of the week she had practically forgotten about the Leap Pad and was right back with the phone.  While giving in and letting her borrow my phone, I decided to see what this Leap Pad is all about.  Didn't take me more than 5 minutes to want my phone back.The package includes nine apps when you initially connect to the Leap Frog website.  Among these are a decent art program, a pet corner and a game that \"teaches\" the flags and various random useless facts about countries the majority of adults have never heard of.  There is also a calculator, a clock and a couple other apps your average preschooler will never touch.  To the extent she has used it at all since the initial days, my daughter only uses the pet and art apps.The package also includes a $20 download card in order to load more programs from the Leap Frog website.  At first I was pretty impressed.  The apps range from $5 and up and you get a discount the more apps you buy.  The apps include games, videos, ebooks and other sorts of \"educational\" material.  I was able to get five apps, so I was pretty happy.  At first the new apps didn't download to the device properly and my daughter couldn't find them, but my husband hooked the device back up to the internet and the problem resolved itself.The problem is, the apps are junk.  The games are very simplistic and repetitive.  Among the games we got, there were two themes.  Three of the games involved inserting missing pieces to create a complete tube or waterslide to get from one end of a path to the other.  Two of the games involved patterns of moving objects out of the way to \"free\" something (a polar bear, for instance).  The one ebook we got was insulting, even for a preschooler's cognitive level and my daughter didn't want to touch it again.I'm sure our mistake was choosing the cheaper alternatives.  I'm guessing that the apps that cost $20 and up may hold your child's attention better.  But who wants to spend that kind of money on a child's toy that already costs nearly $100?  It's just a continual black hole sucking money straight out of your wallet.  You can also choose cartridges which can at least be shared among friends, but they are also expensive and are probably easily lost.Once you set up the device and register your child(ren), Leap Frog will send you periodic updates regarding your child's \"progress\".  This is to give further credibility to Leap Pad as an \"educational learning tool\".  The fact is, however, there is little that is educational about this or any other electronic gadget.  Memorizing facts is not \"learning\".  Age appropriate learning for a preschooler involves hands-on exploration and discovery, pretend play, engagement with parents and other adults, as well as interaction with peers.  None of that is offered - and, in fact, is stilted - by isolated, controlled \"play\" on a gadget.In any case, in this modern world, electronic gadgets may be nearly unavoidable.  If you really think your youngster needs a gadget, a simple small tablet would probably be a better option.  There are plenty of free games and other apps for tablets.  It may not look as inviting and \"child-friendly\" as this device with its two extra styluses and Doc McStuffins wallpaper, but it's a much better deal in the long run.Update 3/13/14:  Two other things I forgot to mention.  First, the Leap Pad is equipped with a camera, but it takes such bad pictures, your child will probably not want to use this feature more than once.  Second, on the pet app, your child can wash his/her pet which involves, among other things, blowing into part of the device to dry off the pet, which the kids think is fun, but I find a bit bizarre.  I don't know whether the germ factor bothers me more (especially since it's designed to be shared among up to three kids) or the fact that it's eerily like a breathalyzer. \n",
