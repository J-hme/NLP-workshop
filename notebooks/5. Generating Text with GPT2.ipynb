    "# Generating Text with GPT-2\n",
    "\n",
    "GPT-2 is a large transformer-based language model developed by OpenAI. This model is unidirectional - it learns to predict the next word in a sequence without knowing what lies beyond. This makes it a generative model. If given a starting sentence, it can generate paragraphs of purely synthetic text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The corpus it was trained on, called WebText, contains slightly over 8 million documents for a total of 40 GB of text from URLs shared in Reddit submissions with at least 3 upvotes. It avoids certain issues encoding vocabulary with word tokens by using byte pair encoding. This allows to represent any string of characters by encoding both individual characters and multiple-character tokens. GPT-2 generates extremely fluent English, and has learned some information about other languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is massive. It has 1.5 billion parameters and took months to train on 100+ GPUs. We don't have that kind of computational power. However, we can get some of the same capabilities of GPT-2 using smaller, simpler versions of the model."
