i find it s mostly people with dogs that also do indoor shoes probably too hard to clean after the dog all the time so they give up and just wear shoes in the living room area
i know thats an asain thing predominately but whats wrong with shoes in the house i have laminate floors and see no issue with it i gotta mop and dust them because of the doggos anyways so whats the bit of dirt on my own shoes
i‚Äôm confused by this statement what if they just came home from somewhere or are getting ready to leave are you assuming they have been chilling at home what am i missing here haha
seriously maybe it s an alaska thing but i ve never met a single person in the years i ve lived here that doesn t take their shoes off when inside a house even people i ve just recently met and invited over will take their shoes off without being prompted
never heard of such a thing until i was an adult i consider it rude to ask people to take their shoes off rude i say
you ain t smelled my feet and you don t wanna either the stinkloafers stay on
looks to me like they are about to or have just finished walking the doggo
my family always wore shoes indoors and then when i was presented with the opposing viewpoint i was like holy shit we ve been monsters this whole time üò± how were we okay with just carrying every pathogen dust mite fecal remnant etc from the outside world just all around our house fools we were üòî
in places like southern california most people leave their shoes on unless you have carpet which is stupid anyways or you live in an area with a lot of rain mud sediment that builds like a clay rich soil then i don‚Äôt think removing shoes is necessary or even comfortable personally i wear my shoes all the time shit even in bed if i‚Äôm tired enough and i never knew it was a thing till i moved to portland in the pnw
to be honest it looks like they just got home and took their jackets off look at the one hanging on the chair
i know i m late to the party here but maybe they just got home
but you guys also put paper covers over toilet seats worried about everything
i‚Äôve got two dogs in my house the shoes are the least of my worries
what if its raining outside do you take the muddy shoes off and put cleaner indoor shoes on my entranceway gets filthy imagine having the whole house like that
it looks like they have solid floors and dog s so the floor will become dirty from dog fluff quite quickly so it s most convenient to keep shoes in my house we have solid floors downstairs and dogs but shoes come off before you go upstairs to the carpet
i grew up with no rules about shoes on off in the house my parents didn t care unless they were really muddy now i m living with my step mum as an adult it s been really hard to adjust to no shoes on in the house i keep forgetting but i do agree it makes it easier to keep the house clean she even insists on wiping the dogs feet every time he s coming in and that works so well too mins of effort now and need to clean so much less later
i felt so bad that it was the first thing i thought
i‚Äôm in australia it‚Äôs pm and i still have my runners on sitting on my sofa
yes do you all have carpet or wooden floors i don t my floor is cold and i don t have slippers for everybody so you better keep your damn shoes on
lol i don‚Äôt get it do they only take them off to have some pootytang in bed or do they keep them on during pootytang too
bitch in america we can do what we want i walked through my house in muddy boots covering in horse shit because i needed something and didn‚Äôt want to walk around the entire house and property clean is a breeze life‚Äôs grand i‚Äôm sorry you are ocd and missing out
maybe just a special event no time to take shoes must propose right here right now
my family is german and we always took our shoes off to go inside my husband generally doesn t and neither do his family unless i ask they re raised australian and kiwi so i guess it s a pretty cultural thing
‚Äúbegin the shoe wars have ‚Äù here ireland i know almost no one who takes their shoes off at the door i‚Äôd be a bit grossed out if people took theirs off in my place i don‚Äôt want to smell your sweaty feet shoes yuck might be other factors in the on off decision the floor type bare or carpeted the weather and resultant shoe types and urban rural
i have a weird thing about feet they gross me out i‚Äôll wear shoes inside or i‚Äôll never take my socks off i have a bunch of socks so i‚Äôll wear a clean pair every day the only time i take them off is when i shower but i put them on right after i get out i know it‚Äôs weird but i still do it
maybe they were on their way out to dinner or just coming back
lot of americans keep their shoes on in the house actually its a normal thing in the south at least like in virginia and the carolinas
my yard is basically sand it gets everywhere and i have dogs with a doggy door so they go in and out whenever they need i try to remember to take my shoes off to minimize the mess but at the end of the day you just make sure you have hardwood floors and you sweep a lot
i have a slipper basket for guests come inside take your shoes off cuz nobody likes a wet mess from shoes and toss on some comfy slippers to keep the dog fur off your socks
i wear shoes indoors because my wife loves her hardwood floors and they hurt my feet
for me it‚Äôs just more comfortable to take them off why would you want to keep them on
have you ever gone out used a public restroom stepped on mud water if you never did any of those things or you really enjoy cleaning your floor then by all means keep doing what you are doing i myself find it disgusting after using restroom at work then come home and smear all that pisshit stain all over my carpet and wooden floor
gt i know thats an asian thing predominately but whats wrong with shoes in the house fuck no it s not i live on the east coast of canada and i don t know anybody who wears their shoes in the house other than if they are going out and forgot something even then running across the floor with your shoes is super feelsbadman
as an american living in asia it throws me for a loop when i visit home and see my parents wearing shoes in the house friends my own age in the us don t but i guess i did grow up that way the worst though is when there s a movie or tv show and someone gets on the bed with their shoes on what the fuck
gt but whats wrong with shoes in the house the difference in the amount of cleaning it makes is massive
shoes go outside sometimes you step in shit other times you step on the filthy ground the entire day shoes are feet prisons and make your feet smell bad and it s not healthy to trap you re feet like that all the time
as an american that hates wearing shoes in the house take my shoes off at other peoples house feels weird because they are wearing them i dont know why they are wearing them we aren t going anywhere we will be in the house for hours but just in case i guess we keep em on i don t know
pssh asian thing that‚Äôs such a white person thing to say most poc take their shoes off you know what not even white person shoes are dirty and i don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôd keep them on especially when it feels great to take them off
ever live in an apartment ever have noisy people above who wore shoes particularly on hard surfaces as for the rest of it not everyone has doggos i m happy to mop and dust as little as possible
it s not just an asian thing i live in europe and have travelled quite a lot around europe i ve never met anyone here who doesn t take their shoes off in the house
lol it s not an asian thing i don t know any country that likes to use shoes inside as much as americans do it s really weird the rest of the world as i know it takes their shoes off
welcome to reddit logic if you don t exactly conform to the worldview of the circlejerk you can fuck right off they think they re on a higher plane of enlightenment and existence they need some way to look down upon these people and their joy because they often have none i have mine on in the house a lot on weekends because i m in and out all day long and i can t be buggered to take them off and put them back on every time especially when they re not dirty
walking on dirty floors makes your feet dirty and then you bring those into your bed or you walk on rugs and they get much dirtier over time i didn‚Äôt grow up with no shoes in the house it‚Äôs just something i didn‚Äôt consider until i lived in a no shoes household and now i can‚Äôt go back
it s generally a cold weather thing the colder the climate the more likely they culture will be to take their shoes off inside
gt even people i ve just recently met and invited over will take their shoes off without being prompted unless my shoes are dirty i ll just look at the feet of whoever answers the door if they don t have shoes on i ll take mine off if they do i won t bother unlacing my boots unless dirty obviously
what if you re just popping into the house for a minute or two to do something real quick before returning outside sitting down somewhere to unlace your boots then lace them back up again when leaving sounds like a royal pain in the ass every single time you enter and leave a home
had a couple fellas come by recently to look at the furnace and they took their shoes off unprompted while still outside appreciated but slightly bizarre
i do think this is mostly an american thing though here in the netherlands people usually keep their shoes on while indoors xd
i know that first thing when i get indoors the shoes will come flying off i hate having my feet restrained by shoes my dad however will wear shoes all day long he‚Äôll come home from work in boots or sneakers and leave them on right up until he goes to bed
i for the contrary know only one person that does that my usa expat neighbor is weird to remove shoes for just being inside your house the floor is cold i may hit my toe on something let me die with my boots on
my dads rule used to be you had to wear shoes in the house
huh i thought it was an american thing to not care about shoe hygiene
my parents are finnish so i was brought up taking my shoes off inside most people in australia don t and it s gross af
not just alaska i m in ohio and rarely see people with their shoes on inside
i live in chicago this isn t uncommon here hell i m wearing my shoes in bed right now since i have to run back downstairs in a few minutes
maybe it s a living on a military base thing but i lived there for five years and no one i knew did that maybe i just wasn t friends with heathens though s
i m from michigan and have lived in nyc for ten years and both places people take off their shoes my dad s family is from florida and they don t i think it s a snowy weather thing for a good part of the year in mi nyc you will be tracking in snow slush if you don t take off your shoes in florida they don t have to worry about that
that s interesting i live in florida and don t take my shoes off at the door either practically no one i know does
ehhhhh every asian family i ve met has a pile of shoes on a rack by the door because no shoes in the house
wait i live in a subtropical city and i literally and visibly frown at people who even step into my house with a shoe on i honestly don t think it s a weather thing anyway i m interested to know why colder weather makes you take off your shoes
definitely isn‚Äôt a thing in australia and it‚Äôs pretty god damn hot here
meh happens in hi because sand and ca because dirtying carpet its more comfy makes sense
everyone in hawaii takes their slippers off before going inside
tell that to indians have you ever been to india you bring spirits into the home if you wear shoes dummy
more cultural i think in the uk it is often considered rude to take your shoes off unless other people do it or they are dirty i change in to indoor shoes but i definitely wear them else my feet end up freezing very quickly the only people i know who ask people to take their shoes off have underfloor heating guest afghan slippers
really i m in nz temperate climate and around of houses are shoes off
as someone in nc i m not sure i know anyone who wants shoes off in their house except for my ex s parents but they were asian
it has to do with winter climate bringing a lot of snow and mud that is easy to drag inside with shoes in dry climates brushing the soles is usually enough to not drag dirt inside but if you have hardwood floors like in sweden you really don t want to drag in moisture
i live in warn climate but i still take my shoes of every time i enter a house
yeah if you left your shoes on during a milwaukee winter your house would be a salty sloppy disaster
live in sc and don t know anyone that just leaves their shoes on
i grew up in upstate ny and i never even heard of taking shoes off in a house til i lived down south in my s
i live in canada bullshit who wants snow and ice fucking up their floor
doing handy work indoors in which situation i would grab my shoes from where i left them when i walked in though
wholeheartedly agree gawd knows what your outside shoes have stepped on
because shoes are a part of what i‚Äôm wearing for the day and i don‚Äôt like walking around in my socks like a weirdo
floors can be cold or wet nothing worse that wet socks
why do people freak out when people wear shoes inside i can fathom a single reason
so this is obviously a special case but i simply can t take off my shoes i m disabled and had several operations on both of my feet and it s just increadibly painful to make a single step or even stand without shoes i also shower with sandals because doing it without is too painful but at a new place i would ofc explain myself before i step inside and my friends and family know about my situation
i almost always have shoes on dont ask me why just do i feel weird with no shoes on
because it is time consuming to take them on and off is one most households in new zealand keep shoes on inside
my dogs are old and stupid and on rare occasion have accidents i d rather not get wet socks if you know what i mean even aside from that they drip water from the water bowl shit even aside from that i transition inside outside pretty often not very imaginative i guess
a lot of people with pets kids have gross floors and i dont want to touch them with my feet also my work shoes smell awful but right now i cant afford a new pair of nice comfy shoes to stand in for hours a day i d really rather not subject people to that reek when i take my shoes off
i have a serious question because people here in puerto rico rarely take them off so if you have a party at your house does everybody have to take their shoes off is it depending on the size of the party if you have a friend over do they need to be barefoot in your house don t get me wrong taking the shoes off seems perfectly logical to me i just can t imagine a whole group of barefoot people at a party or get together for some reason lol
haha yeah he was real unsure about it cute sugar gliders are awesome
okay i m gonna jump get ready i m gonna do it here i go just kidding no way just kidding about just kidding here i come i swear
i think the last one is part sloth he s just got this whole yeah whatever thing going on
it reminded me of when my dog can t decide if he should jump on the bed or not
you d hesitate too if you lived with a guy who had of these gliders you know he s kinda weird
i just want to give him a hug and tell him everything will be okay
clearly a reincarnation of one of the many hesitant teammates i ve had in rocket league
doctor doggos know exactly what you need supervision and cuddles
i don‚Äôt think i‚Äôve ever seen a group of huskies stay still for more than five minutes they must be drugged lol
can i come over i think i suddenly have the flu cough cough
our dog has never been cuddly like that so we got really excited when the puppy we were watching for rover was cuddly and wanted to hop into bed with us ten minutes and approximately paws to the face later we were decidedly less enamored with cuddly puppies and glad that our little guy takes the floor
wow i love your life can i be your second husband my wife may object but when she sees the huskies she‚Äôll understand
i can smell that room just from looking at that pic
please tell me their names are ghost nymeria lady summer grey wind and or shaggy dog
you guys haven t seen your floor in years have you that or you vacuum everything every seconds seriously though how often do you have to empty your vacuum
you are living your best life don‚Äôt doubt it for a second
you know i have dachshunds that sleep in the bed with us not a lot of extra room but those fluff balls there look super comfortable in the winter
i think the appropriate question is how much home is not fur
as someone with two dogs and four cats many furs are in my house light colored hard floors are the only thing that saves me
guaranteed if they had hard wood floors at one point those days are long gone
furs my friend has samoyeds and bought a roomba after complaining about the fur duh it died after a couple weeks surprise surprise
more like how many vacuums do we go through in a year
a bit of food to fill me up cuz i m a lonely hungry pup a gentle soul with asking paw to person with this food i saw am patient for her sharing some but dreaming of the day to come when someone gives me brand new start a home to fill my puppy heart ‚ù§Ô∏è
my dog does this and was supposed to be a stray before i rescued him this makes me believe it
i m tempted to buy a plane ticket and go find this dog lt what city is this in
i hope that dog is adopted or someone give him food everyday poor thing is skinny and so dirty
strays can have great lives they wander where they want eat fallen fruit beg people for food they live really long lives i grew up in a third world country so you see them everywhere they are often friendly temples will often feed them when they visit too it seems like a happy life
my girl does this whenever i stop scritching her head always gets me to start again she‚Äôs trained me well
it breaks my heart to see hungry stray animals my heart would want to take them all home but i know it‚Äôs not possible i could not go on vacation to any place that strays are common
tapped her knee to tell her last one did not count yes agreed this dog deserves a loving home
just think about all the other generous people there i m sure it has a good life with all those food stalls and pets from strangers
my sister s dog does this but instead of a gentle tap she scratches the shit out of you leg untill she gets what she wants
only after the puppies are found if you look at her belly you can see her nipples are swollen with milk it means she s still nursing babies i hope she gets all the food she can eat for her and her babies
i think it would have hit his right elbow judging by the angle of descent
nah look at the angle it would have went right past his face
i m an umpire for hs games ll etc it amazes me how many parents without looking just cringe and hope the foul pop up right above their head doesn t nail them in the head it often does
yeah he was inches away from pissing off an entire fan base lol
also if the kid had caught it when the fielder was right there the kid probably would have been kicked out of the game for fan interference
not even close ball‚Äôs moving outwards would‚Äôve been past his face
i remember as a kid at camden yards ken griffey was doing some bp and hit a line drive right towards my moms head who was not paying attention i saw it coming and was thought my mom is about to die at an orioles game but thankfully at the last second some kid jumped right in front and caught the ball inches from the side of her head i also remember going to a game at the vet in june of and chipper jones got drilled in the face on a pop fly on a sunny hot day
no he wouldnt he was moving his glove to catch the ball but the player s glove got in the way
wouldn t really cut it for being a dodger now would he
i ve seen a guy on his first time trying baseball idiot coach sent him to left field and hit a flyball which hit the poor kid right in the teeth a lot of blood and messed up teeth everywhere that was years ago and he still has problems
yea i remember playing little leagues and taking a pop fly to the face besides a black eye it‚Äôs not too bad i‚Äôve seen worse when people get a ball right in the gut
at my first ever soccer practice at about age i got hit on the top of my head by a ball and my first tooth fell out hilarious in retrospect but i‚Äôve never been entirely comfortable with ball sports since
nah i knew it wouldn t hit him even his shirt says he s a dodger
yeah that guy did him a huge favor because he was going to take that one right on the top of his head
yeah it was communicative felt the amazement of this kid meeting one of his heroes
all i‚Äôm picturing form this a scene where there‚Äôs a kid a kid who just witnessed superman saves a plane falling from the sky then superman spots him walks over and says something inspiring to him
absolutely i want to take a kid to a baseball game right now
one little clip gives the entire feeling of childhood exuberance and old fashioned pure americana
this is why baseball is a great sport a lot of moments of endearment since the audience can easily become part of a play edit and also moments like that cubs fan caused
this is like watching a wheaties commercial in real life
what if we warm up his cold heart with a warm island song
he was immediately kicked out of the game for interference
did he give the kid the ball after i hope hope hope he did
the only people happier are the parents they saved a small fortune in dental work
totally agree this is better than of the crap i see on reddit that‚Äôs meant to melt me down
especially considering could ve turned out extremely different
this is the only thing that has made me genuinely smile today
for some reason i‚Äôm disappointed you didn‚Äôt refer to them as ‚Äúcockles ‚Äù
lol lookit that lil redheaded fella gets me everytime
i dunno kid looked kinda like get your hands off my popcorn jackwagon
you d think he d have gotten rid of those sideburns
except it s popcorn so you know a kernel skin is stuck in at the back of his throat making him cough while he tries to play next time fruit snacks kid next time have fruit snacks
look at that little red headed fffffffff ella hahahahah fuck was so close to coming out of his mouth
mattingly i thought i told you to shave off those sideburns
totally appropriate reaction to touching ichiro tbh
this is the best one it takes her like a full minute to process what had happened
it makes me chuckle every time someone links to this partly because i went to school with her and the people around her partly because it‚Äôs just insane
love how you can actually tell she says i have to call tell my mom
come on yes network you gotta give a better call than that
i m really glad i stuck around for that last take ichiro just slapped me in the face
i love how no one calls him by his full name you ve got to be beyond a superstar to only go by your first name like kobe or shaq
the real question did ichiro find her after the game for some easy daps
lost it at the narrator going ‚Äúichiro just slapped me in the face‚Äù haha
rofl first i watched it i was like man dude totally just bushed his hand on her leg a mere mortal man would get skinned alive for that then i realized he was just apologizing for elbowing her in the face it made so much more sense
one time ichiro punched me in the face it was awesome
no lie i expected this to be a clip from an anime where some character is overly enjoying letting his fingers bump against spinning fan blades
don‚Äôt even have to click i love the ichiro video haha
best part of it is her friends reaction shes seen where this leads and is looking for a way out
you can hear her american accent like when dave chapelle does an imitation of a white person
i went to my first baseball game at atlanta braves when i was i heard a bunch of people say heads up heads up i was really paying much attention and i got hit right in the gut got a ball out of it hah
i was at a mariners game in the dome once and there was a hiiiiiiiiiigh pop into the st base stands i grew up going to games with my grandfather always wearing my glove in the stands only now i am a grown person without a glove and not expecting a ball hit my way as i belatedly realized that the ball was coming to me my many years of organized ball playing kicked in and i reached out my left hand perfectly to field the ball except i was not wearing a glove motherfucking fuck goddam it shit shit shit as the ball hit my hand and away it bounced with me screaming and howling and shaking my hand was there with my mom i am sure that somewhere in mlb archives there is some hilarious footage
i don t know how old i was but i was a kid and it was my first game a ball was coming right at me and i had my glove ready i ve always been terrible at sports flew past my glove hit me square in the head and actually bounced up somewhere a couple rows higher than me and a little girl caught it after i got checked for a concussion they would not let us have it and that s why i never played baseball
we were at a minor league game a couple weeks back a pop up foul went into the stands everyone in the section tracked it except for this one lady who sat there and covered her head the ball landed behind her and she laughed the usher very politely told her it wasn t funny and if she didn t want to pay attention to foul balls then she should watch the game from the concourse
why does this amaze you people who don t do sports or related activity have a much less trained kinetic vision if i thought it was close to hitting me based on its trajectory me trying to dodge it is just as likely to put me in the actual direct path of the ball as me standing still will do unless i have the maneuverability to run the fuck away in say empty stands at least if i cover my eyes with my hands it doesn t hit me in the eye
when i was about the age of i went to a local baseball game i walked out of the stadium with a friend to use the restroom when i walked out of the restroom a baseball went over the stadium and hit me straight in the elbow it hurt like crazy but was also super cool
it s simply a matter of being trained experienced vs untrained inexperienced if you re trained you ll catch it or dodge it without thinking if you aren t trained you ll freeze and get bonked on the head or turtle and hope for the best hell it doesn t even have to be a baseball thing the whole idea of dad reflexes is basically the result of a lifetime of training for unexpected physical situations through rough housing competition sports physical activity showing off getting hurt etc the active experienced trained person will react without thinking in the most optimal way they know how purely on reflex and muscle memory the untrained inexperienced inactive person has no context for the situation and will do what they know best likely nothing or something stupid
gt it amazes me how many parents without looking just cringe and hope the foul pop up right above their head doesn t nail them in the head it often does most of them don t have the ability to catch it and if they looked up it would probably hit them directly in the face so they d rather take it on the top of the head with their neck clenched
if you re at a tournament somewhere and someone yells heads up you never know which field it s coming from unless it s the game you re watching there s rarely time to look around and see which direction it s coming from i always just cover my head
i was a season ticket holder at the royals for years i was in prime foul ball that could kill you territory the number of times i would watch some duck and cover without knowing where the ball was going was easily in thousands
it s crazy to me that at pro baseball games every day hundreds of people routinely dont pay attention while super humans with sticks hit small meteors at them going over mph i got hit in the eye with a misjudged popup when i was about and half my face was purple and blue for a month i will never again ignore an in play baseball within feet of me
cringing only works to protect yourself from memories
u schnoodledoodledo you never fail to impress my friend ‚ô•Ô∏è
if this isn‚Äôt the most beautiful thing i‚Äôve read all day
u schnoodledoodledo has made more people cry than avengers endgame
lost my little rescue girl a couple weeks ago sad happy tears now you jerk
"y u always pop up on every post i read into the comments
i love this"
why is there always a person writing a poem on these posts
i m on a bus schnoodle i don t need to be tearing up
do you want this cross stitched cause i really want to cross stitch this for you lt
i read the first comment saw ‚Äúschnoodle‚Äù and was like ‚Äúoh they‚Äôre gonna get me again ‚Äù and then i kept reading for some reason and you did i tested up
that was beautiful and i m a little upset with you about it
only in play if there s a base runner to be fair we need more context
i think if it was still in play he wouldnt have held the position like he did after he caught it you gotta get it back to the infield as quick as possible also players usually only give the ball away after a rd out i mean he could ve here if bases were empty but i dont recall ever seeing it
the reason he already has a ball is to seem like the nice guy he‚Äôd give the ball he brought to the game to someone else while he keeps the ball he caught
the romantic in me says he should give the kid the ball and say keep this memory in your heart and all the other players should just accept it
at the very end of the gif it looks like he‚Äôs rotating his wrist and torso to line up for an overhead throw so it was probably still in play
the ball is still live yes but with no runners on there is no penalty for giving the kid the ball judging by his cavalier attitude either there are no runners its out number or he‚Äôs mistaken and just believes it‚Äôs one of the two reasons mentioned
even if the ball is still in play couldn‚Äôt he give it away and someone just toss him another ball feel like i‚Äôve seen that happen
i think he likes what he did get way better screw the ball man
i think the kid was more appalled that an opponent stole a ball from him
giving the ball to a dodgers fan üòÇ kid doesn‚Äôt even know how not to interfere in the game
how could the ball still be in play after it was caught since it was foul
to expand on this there was a player a few years back that thought his catch in the outfield was out and he threw the ball into the crowd the runner already on base was awarded a base due to the error
also that kid was totally going to get drilled in the face since he didn‚Äôt have his glove over his face and couldn‚Äôt really see
reminds me of that game years ago where the guy reached over and caught it when one of the outfielders would have gotten and out and everyone went balllistic
thanks until i read this i was thinking why is the kid so happy that the dude sat next to him caught the ball
i don t think people realize he doesn t play for the team that the kid is repping if the kid was a fan of the team he would have gotten way out of the way to gove thw player a better chance and as a player you give the ball to a fan of your own team not the opposing team
also don‚Äôt people know not to interfere with balls in play by now and maybe don‚Äôt let their kids do it either
why should a kid give an even younger kid the ball he caught seems ridiculous and an older kid would have to turn around and give the ball to the pretty young woman nearby once you start carrying around decoy balls to hand out maybe it s time everybody just kept the damn ball with no expectations of chivalry
i‚Äôd put her down if she‚Äôs at that point in her life
that makes me very sad and remembers me to give lots of love to my pets
i‚Äôm weak willed to my dog she wants so little in life besides love playtime and food i always just give her a scrap from whatever i‚Äôm eating so long as it‚Äôs healthy for her if i can‚Äôt give her my food i always put a dog treat on my plate and give her bits of it throughout the meal to make sure she knows she‚Äôs included i know a lot of people don‚Äôt like to feed their pets human food or food at the table but i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a big bother anything to make their short little lives a bit better is worth any slight annoyance
always appreciate the annoyances of your dog my dog throws up a lot but i know that one day he will be gone and i will miss him so i don t care about cleaning some throw up off the floor or bed it s not much of a task if it s what i have to do to be with my dog
pat her head when getting up so she knows you aren‚Äôt there anymore
i met a guy with a blind deaf dog he was a asshole he moved his furniture around just to watch his dog bump into shit
this is currently my situation with my dog she‚Äôs almost and has been blind for almost years i think i found it kinda funny for a while when she‚Äôd get up and sniff the air until she found the food now it makes me sad and i‚Äôm constantly helping her around and just giving her extra treats
my dog used to sit on his hind legs and beg with both hands but magically one day months ago he got arthritis overnight and he s all the sudden an old man who isn t about that anymore
old shep red foley first song to ever make me cry for no reason other than listening to it
this is exactly the reason why my dad in his fifties refuses to buy himself a dog although he loves them he says he d be heartbroken when the dog dies eventually
that‚Äôs the decoy ball the kid has to give an even younger child if they come up to him wanting the real ball
his master has taught him well grasshopper is ready
the grown man in red to his left is so impressed as am i
oh my god i ve seen this so many times and never noticed
how many more years before we find out if that move paid off for him
i always wonder and giggle what if this video would have never been made or the girl never saw it and if she wants to sell that ball like years later thinking it was the ball from the game that probably wouldn t count as fraud but imagine the look on her face when it somehow comes to light that it was indeed just a decoy by this little soab probably her words not mine
i like how the one lady on the right is trying to kill his game you can see her mouth the other one or something along those lines
this guy is going to be the next bill gates or something smooth
i came here for king julian comments and they were delivered lol
i love madagascar i gotta get the sequels at amoeba when i trade in store credit bad santa atomic blonde ocean s and many others john wick amp blade runner
lol i just commented the same sorta thing probably should have scrolled down first üòÖ
my dog does do this and i am no longer allowed to do touch my laptop on the couch
when i stop petting my cat she raises a paw up like she is calling my attention to keep petting her
my cat kind of already does playing a video game she tries to get on my controller until i pay attention to her laying in bed looking at my phone nudges my phone until i put it down and pay attention to her it s not hand gestures but she gets her point across nonetheless
um my cat does apply pets stop pause cat taps my leg with his paw then turns head to provide most desirable petting spot this can go on for a while
my dog does this i get his paw put back on my hand with tapping motions and sometimes a moppy whine am currently petting him not doing the dishes
one of my cats will crawl into my chest as i m laying down and reading on my phone he ll nip and lick my hands to demand scritches if i stop before he s had enough he ll return to nipping me until i resume pets it s both adorable and mildly infuriating
my cat does this with ear scratches when i stop he pets himself then my hand to show me what i need to be doing
my cat sort of does this when she wants pets she d slide up next to me on my desk and stare at me if i ignore her or i m busy she headbutts my palm trying to get me to rub her head if that doesn t work she puts a paw up on my thigh and gently scratches like excuse me i want my pets now please she also does this when i m petting her but stop after a few seconds like she s offended the petting time was so short
my cat doesn t quite do this but she does pet me to let me know she wants pets she used to pet my face in the middle of the night while i was asleep to ask for pets she no longer sleeps in the bedroom
my cat just looks over his shoulder with a mixture of sadness and disappointment which usually guilts me into more pets
oddly enough i have a cat raised since new born that does something like that she likes to be pet on her chest and if i take my hand away she‚Äôll attempt to pick up my hand to bring it back to her body
my cat sits next to her grooming glove and whines to communicate her demands
why did i take this seriously and thought i had a cool new fact to share
so one of them dies right i‚Äôm wondering because other comments make it sound like they‚Äôre going to live happily ever after that‚Äôs just the folks that didn‚Äôt read the article right
pretty sure the elephant kn the left was giving the big s u c c to the elephant on the right
i thought you were exaggerating but i literally couldn‚Äôt hold back tears üò≠
shirley knew that jenny was dying so she went into the woods she didn‚Äôt come back until jenny passed next morning shirley also didn‚Äôt eat for two days ugh
went in thinking ‚Äúnah i won‚Äôt cry it wasn‚Äôt that cute ‚Äù left crying
do you think zoos do too what about pet reptiles i smell a reactionary
thank you i had to scroll through all these comments to find someone who remembers the controversy short memory internet
try telling this to the moderators of this sub who don t give a shit that some of the videos they allow here promote exploitation of wild animals when i sent them a pm about it they gave me a bs cop out answer so frustrating
let us live man i m all for wildlife preservation but watching this lemur video brings me a small speck of joy and brings me no closer to owning one as a pet the article itself says there is no real way of knowing how much these videos influence lemur pet ownership rates and it seems to be far more of a problem within madagascar than abroad
oh right i forgot i don t give a shit i ll be sure to not keep lemurs as pets thanks
get over yourself already you talk like every human being is always on the internet all the time no animals were harmed by me smiling at a cute little lemur gif on reddit
so we can t share cute videos of wild animals because stupid people exist and might get dumb ideas what kind of argument is that
the study found no evidence more people actually bought a lemur as a pet it found that more people stated i want a pet lemur and there were more searches for pet lemur after this video went viral tons of people with no intention of actually owning a lemur would respond in such a way further searching about pet lemurs is innocuous in fact searching about lemurs leads to information about how difficult it is to care for a pet lemur i just don t see how the study is a reason for significant concern
it s been way more than days i saw them doing this years ago oddly they haven t aged a day
stockholm syndrome has set in at this point they ll just bring it with them when they go home
you got the hostage part right children in parts of africa most parts even are abducted and turned into child soldiers many are slaughtered raped tortured etc i recommend watching the documentary called invisible children
for less than the price of one coffee per day you can save a child from the deplorable conditions in the lemur massage parlors these children are forced to pet an scratch lemurs up to grueling hours per day given only short breaks for water and restroom use the children are under no obligation to stay but the monkeys are so cute that only the most cold hearted and closed off person alive would refuse the call to rub that monkey call now and save a child from a life of monkey rubbing

me mom can we have a lemur at home mom we already have a lemur at home lemur at home meeeeeeeow
it‚Äôs crazy to think that so many people out there simply don‚Äôt give a fuck about animal suffering there‚Äôs a post on the front page right now about a bar with an aquarium fish built into the counter and so many of the comments are shit like ‚Äúwho cares if it‚Äôs loud for the fish‚Äù i see that shit and i can‚Äôt help but think fish are literally trapped there with it sounding like firecrackers are going off around them their entire lives it‚Äôs sad and yet tons of people just truly don‚Äôt give a fuck
greed is a hell of a corrupt motivator i can t even bring myself to kill a wasp or a spider even if it s in my personal space
this is why i‚Äôve been vegan for years i grew up on a farm and could not make sense of killing or harming any creature
if we discovered elephants living on another planet instead of having them here on earth i m pretty sure we d consider them to be intelligent aliens that shouldn t be interfered with i mean they protect their children all the elephants in a herd look out of the babies they show empathy towards other animals sometimes they bury their dead and mourn them they form lifelong friendships they are complex creatures
right like would it have been that bad to use polished wood for piano keys instead instead of slaughtering probably millions of animals
there are enough people out there who can tune out the feelings of others and then do shitty stuff i don t get it but i ve met some pretty fucking awful people who clearly have this tune out trait i don t think it s a black and white thing it s more like they selectively empathize
they do it for money dumbass wtf you think a rainbow is baffling
where did that come from not sure where you live but here in america circuses don t tend to have animal cruelty and treat them like you would a pet
nobody cares about bugs such as roaches or earthworm though
animals but really beings not too different from us
i mean pigeons are beautiful but people will gladly kill them
starting to think humans on average really aren‚Äôt worth saving in a lot of ways we‚Äôre just disgusting entitys
buy frozen blueberries and shop around it cost like at safeway for a little tiny box of blueberries or about the same for a huge lb bag of frozen blueberries at the discount grocery store
not when it grows like weeds across the landscape ireland
frozen stuff is usually cheaper same nutritional value and doesn t go bad after days
move to sweden we have wild blueberries in the forest fuckin everywhere for free
there are literally square miles of blueberry patches where i live unfortunately that‚Äôs all
blueberries blackberries and strawberries always have sales on them occasionally now raspberries those ducking things are like for a tiny ass thing of them with like berries
it‚Äôs like for a medium box right now that‚Äôs really not expensive
i usually drop the whole package and they explode out onto the floor like marbles i just gotta stand there and cry for a few minutes before picking them up while pouting
try new fruitballs‚òÜ all natural ingredients at half the price high fructose corn syrup fruit extract
if youre gong to bake with fruit like a crumble frozen fruit is much cheaper per kilo than fresh and you can t really tell the difference once it s mushed up and baked
get them frozen they are amazing as a snack and much cheaper than fresh usually even if you get them with an organic label i use a handful of frozen bluebs in green smoothies every day
if you have any room at all grow them at work someone brought in some raspberry plants with absolutely no effort we got bowls and bowls of raspberries so many that we then wanted to get rid of some of them for a different fruit then the higher ups basically nuked the entire yard area because it had a brick garage and a foot section had some misaligned bricks one of the neighbors backed into it years ago while theres never any money for raises they couldn t spend k to tear that garage down fast enough and threw out my fucking hockey net but yeah raspberries take no effort to grow too many i m assuming blueberries are at least in the same ballpark if we had put in even minimal effort we probably wouldve had way more and even better rasperries
it s because big meat and dairy have bigger government subsidies than fruit and veg if we dropped all the food subsidies the fresh plants would be generally much cheaper than the animal products
i was shocked when i went to the us that fruit is pricey in the uk it‚Äôs really really cheap
invest in blueberry bushes i have a few and they produce a ton of berries
kinda sad how expensive it is to be healthy i started doing keto a few months back and for a small bag of ‚Äúketo‚Äù flour cups it is which is necessary if you want to make low carb bread pizza etc since they don‚Äôt sell that stuff in grocery stores
it s not important enough to receive the kind of government subsidization that sugar deserves
i got pounds of honeycrisp apples for bucks bananas are like cents a pound were i live it s the rest that get pricey small plastic of berries goes for
free in my garden i could eat blueberries for weeks and never run out
most of it grows on trees aren t things that grow on trees supposed to be cheap have i been lied to all my life
in finland you can go to nearest forest and pick as many you can find
it s so depressing to think about people are so selfish and unempathetic that they completely disregard the thoughts feelings well being of innocent creatures for what a cool decoration it makes me sick and it just feels so helpless i wish we could just turn everyone s empathy meter up a few notches
yea just saw that one and got upset animals shouldn t be used for tricks like that there s many ways to simulate that digitally people don t care and some actually enjoy it
guys i m just speaking my opinion don t say i hate animals i love animals technically they re safer in there than in rivers by now they re for the most part adapted to tank life because we as humans suck and i ve seen a couple times goldfish get absolutely fncked in the wild the only way they d be safe is if the river were empty with a ceiling because birds
this is such a weird thing for me as a grown ass man this elephant video literally made my eyes well up while sitting at my desk at work thinking about how happy they look and the pains they must have experienced in their life on the flip side i feel nothing about the fish in the bar i just dont equate fish as the same thing as an animal like an elephant i know that i am wrong i know that no animal deserves to live their life like that but i just can t change the way i feel about the situation and it annoys me
it s crazy how many people think they give a fuck about animal suffering and still eat meat and dairy downvote the truth if you want hypocrites
i got downvoted to hell over concern for the cat with actual glitter and purple coloring on its fur accident my ass
i mean i care a lot more about elephants than about fish but i agree
im more worried about the humans elephants aside the shorter the lifespan and the less capacity to contemplate the how and why of the suffering the less i care
it seriously blows my mind people are proud to kill these animals for fun i‚Äôll never understand it and i thank god that i never will
because we have no reason to give a fuck at all reason your bleeding heart doesnt promp people to care
thanks for making me feel like shit when i saw this heartwarming post never fails every single time
plants literally chemically scream to each other that s sentience so no eating or trimming them
that s where you draw the line the thousands of kilograms of meat available at every supermarket didn t clue you in
fish do not have the capacity to understand or care your pushing human feelings on them who cares
it s sort of a limitation of the human brain every single one of us has a long list of things we don t care about that we probably should at any given moment be it livestock farming the plight of palestinians in the west bank energy conservation saving the rain forest etc we simply have to prioritize and deprioritize but if you mean you can t believe someone can be confronted with it and not at least think it s less than moral then i totally agree
i truly believe humans gaining sentience was the worst thing that ever happened to this planet
i read the comments on that post and was actually pleasantly surprised to see that people in fact did care anyway fuck humans
if i paid you a hundred grand to kill an elephant you d probably stop caring pretty fast
do you eat fish what separates the fish in the aquarium from the fish that end up in nets stressing out
gt there‚Äôs a post on the front page right now about a bar with an aquarium with fish built into the counter and so many of the comments are shit like ‚Äúwho cares if it‚Äôs loud for the fish‚Äù this is such an interesting topic to me the absence of empathy in humans and the challenge of teaching people how to have it few people have a really strong sense of how to inculcate it and some people take the lazy stance of that s just human nature you can t do anything about it but we need to come up with something that instills humans with humanity because lack of it is making us into our worst selves
you know people don t even give a fuck about others as well dropping bombs firing missles on other countries are considered normal by us norms so why bother with animal when you dont care about other human being
yeah but the same people eat fish so it isn t surprising really
i saw that and the bar also looks very narrow plus there is too much light and not enough plants so the poor fish are literally stuck in a super noisy place with no where to hide and there is barely enough room for them to swim just because someone thinks it looks cool to have it like that it looks ridiculous and is a classic example of money can t buy taste it looks like those clear toilet seats with the coins embedded in it to me it s almost the same lines taste wise i just don t get why they don t have a regular fish tank somewhere instead
it‚Äôs about money people do things because they need to survive there now you understand
it‚Äôs the inherent value of life people need to see that animals should not be subject to the needs of people all non human creatures are subject to the experience of life and live in their best interest not to suffer just like humans so why put them through it
i saw that i didn‚Äôt think about that at all but i did think it was weird animal suffering is sad our neighbor ran over our cat in front of us then drove off and tried posting on our neighborhoods fb group that the cat ran in front of them blah blah and multiple people from our neighborhood were like ‚Äúwho cares‚Äù ‚Äúit‚Äôs just a cat‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy was your cat outside ‚Äù it has definitely made me not want to come in contact with most of the people in our neighborhood like if your kid got hit cause all y‚Äôall mf‚Äôs speed i wouldn‚Äôt go to you and be like ‚Äúoh wel it‚Äôs just a kid ‚Äù ‚Äúwhy did you let your kid outside ‚Äù people are exactly as you say selfish and not empathetic i hate hoomans generally tbh
sadly true the first dog i remember only lived years old i was when she died
but the dog will love him regardless until that time arrives and will likely cement some emotion or character trait in the kiddo that will persevere in the kid without directly knowing it as he grows love of a good pupper stays with you in some form regardless of age
i had a parrot he died when i was and i still remember him
i grew up with my dog i was so small that her brother pulled down my pants one of the reasons that we chose our dog she made it to years but i never forget her
large breads still easily get years and older so not really sure what your point is
i never knew why my parents refused to let me get a dog when i was years old now i know
i was going to say something similar however he may only be a young dane my dane is the same age as my son now and i think my son is old enough to remember
children begin forming memories around age so the baby will likely have memories of the giant dog and none of us know right never know when life will end every day is a gift and a gamble so just enjoy
the dog doesn‚Äôt look very old big dogs live almost years if you‚Äôre lucky right
i know a great dane he was this size at months they live for a short time yeah but that also means they grow up super fast
who cut onions around here my dog is a large breed and she‚Äôs getting up there in age the vet just diagnosed her with the beginning stages of arthritis our walks gotten a little shorter we throw the ball a few times less it doesn‚Äôt seem fair that such wonderful creatures are only around for such a comparatively short time
before that happens they will have developed default password level bonds
i have a six month old baby that loves our dog smiles or laughs every time he sees him and already loves petting him he may not remember this later in life but they already have a beautiful friendship
that definitely needed to be said you are an angel no a saint
i was actually thinking the same thing about how tragically sad it may be that the beautiful dog would potentially have those memories of caring and protecting go with it when it passes and it definitely looks a stunning animal hmm
i really wanted a great dane always loved the look of them but i did some research before that year life span prob filled with medical issues is a deal breaker üò¢ to those with great danes hope things end up differently and you got the outlier
same as in german seehund which directly translates to sea dog
i hear what you re saying but it seems to me that in fact dogs are just land seals
interesting in thai seals are called ‡πÅ‡∏°‡∏ß‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≥ which literally translates to water ‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≥ cat ‡πÅ‡∏°‡∏ß so i guess in thailand seals are water cattos
to add to the fun the hawaiians name for their monk seal is ilio holo i ka uaua which translates to dog that runs in rough water some things are pretty universal
so why to do we call them sea lions our logic put into the english language is beyond me
what was that language where lots of animals were pigs is this a water pig in that language
only a matter of time until they catch on and start adopting each other and kicking us out of our houses
only a matter of time until they evolve thumbs to open treats and foot on their own
every time i pet a dog i feel a love inside from me from them we share it it just cannot be denied their eager happy faces when they feel a human hand the wordless look of gratitude that we both understand i am dog hello my friend i feel your human touch just met you but i love you n appreciate you much if dogs can make us feel that way just like a loving brother why can t we do that too n just be nice to one another
dumb but honest question do dogs care about other dogs affection as much as they care about ours
the age of men is over the time of the dog has come
currently trying to teach my dog to rub his own belly lol
gt does u have za fever checks with paw gt smiles nah buddy you is cool
somewhere out there is a video of two dogs taking turns petting each other i don t remember where or when i saw it it was cute but neither dog had the patience to let the other for more then two or three pats then was like okay now my turn
i once read a study where apparently puppies were happier when they got attention from a random human than when they got attention from their mother i think our position is safe
the white one is pepper and the black one is salt obviously
sorry we were only going to adopt the white kitten at first and her name is marshmallow fluff but her sister didn‚Äôt have a home so we ended up getting her as well her foster mom had named her night fury

these memories you ll keep reminded me of my dog that passed away years ago why you cutting onions u schnoodledoodledo
i saw this post and hoped i would find one of your poems here
you re very quickly becoming one of my favorite redditors
this is how it starts tha chain of events that is about to happen is destiny dont fight it boy the gods chose you for a reason
just started sopranos for the first run last night glad this is the too comment also kind if weirded out
damnit i need to start sorting by new i never get to make these comments first
i love when he buys bird seed in the fall and explains the ducks from canada are coming because this is the south to them
wow i m hours and dozens of posts too late goddamn it reddit
goddammit i never get to have an original comment or be the quickest to post it on reddit
maybe i do remember seeing a video about a dog that looked like this one that was blind and deaf i dont remember where i sae it so my evidence iant worth anything
it could also be the dog was taught the same sequence over and over and over the owner is also giving hand commands with the phone a few times to help prompt i don t think that was intentional but there are definite sit roll over style prompting even with the camera
yea i was about to be impressed and then i unmuted and there was some music playing instead
i just want to know how they are filming this lol do they bite on the camera
could be using hand signals too but if they‚Äôve dubbed over the sound with music could be either or both
i agree that this is most likely though honestly it s not harder to teach a dog with visual cues than verbal ones we had a dog that was born deaf and we taught it lots of hand gestures
could also be gesturing with her left hand notice how the dog is looking directly at the owner most of the time and for the last trick they don t even look at the phone
she s doing hand signals as well still very cute though
bullshit if you turn on the sound the owner was clearly playing guitar and singing some cloyingly sweet song
it s the hand gestures the owner is making dogs respond better through physical commands like sign language compared to verbal
need to make sure they have a way to get out of the pool or they can swim till they re exhausted and drown
we had a male and female duck come to our pool for years and my dad would run out and scare them off
we had some and they got stuck in the pool make sure the chicks can get out somewhere
i‚Äôm not worried about the skimmers but those edges around there are not good for fat kids as a fat kid who is now a fat adult i will fell you that is gonna scrape the belly how am i supposed to beach myself onto that sharp edge
this might sound morbid but make sure they can get back out the ducks in my building lead their babies into the swimming pool and there was no ramp or anything none of the babies made it back out again
how are you going to get them to make their way to the pond
literally came here to ask i get all kinds of wildlife my pool has basically been turned into a pond as in i had to replace the water the filtration system and pretty much everything that makes a pool a pool now it s basically a man made pond which i m fine with honestly turns out my house sits right in the middle of a spot that all of nature stops and rests at amp x b i knew we had endangered species on the property when i bought it despite the efforts of my neighbors to have it groomed they ve tried to take me to court year after year to sue me for making the neighborhood look messy or letting trees fall but there is no hoa and the city won t touch the case because of federal regulations i m not allowed to make those kind of decisions without being sued by the actual government and honestly i have no desire to nature needs a place to live to eh lie sorry about the trees but if it s between going to court for a judge to tell you that once it lands on your property the tree is your problem or paying the feds over a hundred thousand dollars for cutting down a tree they don t want cut down i mean sorry not sorry neighbors the tops were hanging over your property for years you could have them cut any time without a law suit because you do not own the property and i could literally give less than a fuck i can t i signed paperwork promising i would not touch anything past a certain point on my own property i was fine with that because i m down with forests forests are awesome amp x b i literally have a plaque in my front yard that i did not put there the government did and it states that my property houses an assortment of endangered species i m not allowed to touch any of it only certain areas like a tiny swath of grass in the front and about acre in the back the rest is preservation and leads directly to a tributary that comes straight of off the potomac every rare creature in maryland migrates through my back yard so do the common creatures amp x b i would be devastated if i found a baby anything in my pool filter like snot faced crying devastated amp x b good on you for thinking ahead
this is so great we are even considering not crucifying you for filming this vertically
you can normally turn them partially on just put the lever slightly turned i was doing that when we were running low on water so it still partially work doing so the skimmer still catch some floating junk while not being powerfull enought to trap them
my first memory as a child is having my hand get bit by a horse that first scene was hard to watch
it really depends on the horse their lips are incredibly sensitive in a handful of pebbles and treats they can pick out the treats without moving the pebbles too much and know when they ve crunching fingers biting hands is something they learn and if the horse hasnt learned it you re pretty safe my horse even with all the times my fingers have ended up between his teeth when feeding him has never bit me i dont think a young person even has the strength to pinch hard enough to elicit a bite horses are big tough animals and they re more likely to whack you with a tail if you re bugging them rather than bite you
i d be most worried about a kick even the gentlest horse will kick out randomly at flies or startle at a plastic bag and that toddler head would not do well with the impact i m all for giving kids lots of opportunity to learn compassion with animals but allowing a toddler free roam in a pen with lb animals is a bit too risky
i saw my cousins favorite horse bite her lip off not the smarted move i ve seen
i get it with horses maybe wild bison which people seem to think are docile enough to roll down your windows and let them stick their heads in a car absolutely not
i know my in laws train do rodeo and board horses they explicitly told me to only give a horse the palm of my hand fingers are too similar to carrots
this should be the top comment one bite and the fingers are all gone
and horses will bite intentionally or not if you don‚Äôt hold your hand right feeding them kid got lucky imo
asking the real questions now i‚Äôve wondered this all my life
any dog really my dog howls when i leave the house i absolutely refuse to go outside until the uber is right outside it s painful
i wake up first and my golden takes my spot as soon as i get up or he gets enough motivation to jump on the bed then he falls back asleep we have an agreement that he won t cry when i leave and i won t cry either
i have two of them and it s extremely difficult they are such goofs
imagine waking up and saying snuggles and your golden jumps up on the bed and lays directly on your body it s my life everyday i don t know how anything gets done
i dont know my golden retriever will constantly want pet making the only to take pictures is when he asleep even that doesnt work because he can sense your presence and want pets
i just paid for my first one pups were born a couple days ago registered and full blooded waiting to go get first pick of the litter they are all so cute
my aunt has a golden retriever and it s mainly because you don t want to wake her up then again she s also quite old i don t have pictures atm
ill tell you what i do i have shaped my daily routine so i get to pet other golde retrievers around the city across my commute
my neighbor had one that sticks his head over the fence to bark for my dog to play i cannot resist the urge to give him some love every time that cute head pops up
ugh you aren t kidding i lost my nearly year old golden last summer and miss it and him constantly i am looking to get a new one this summer if anyone knows any reputable breeders in the western ny area
as i leave i tell him i work hard so he can have a better life it‚Äôs a struggle every morning though filled with ‚Äúi love you whose a good boye ok don‚Äôt eat anything i promise i‚Äôll be back in hours you‚Äôre in charge while i‚Äôm gone make sure the fish behave i love you i‚Äôll see you soon‚Äù shuts door only to reopen ‚Äúi love you so much i‚Äôm sorry i‚Äôll see you soon okay‚Äù every single day
i dont have a golden but im late to work every single day because i dont wake up early enough to account for the time i spend with my dog in the morning he celebrates when i get outta bed and we just cuddle on the floor for like mins and then after his food walk etc i spend another mins saying goodbye promising him im coming back telling him to be good and laying on the extra pats and nuzzles thick
it s actually just a visual trick by strapping chameleons to your hand and arm to camouflage with the background you can make it look like you aren t petting the dog while recording or taking a picture
we don‚Äôt had golden‚Äôs all my life i‚Äôve spent the last years stuck in this house not able to stop petting my dog i was originally going to go get some milk at the grocery store but years later i now produce my own milk
by petting them and saying i love you a couple hundred times
we got a golden here in the office comes in everyday let me tell you it is difficult
it‚Äôs balance do you want to be petted talked to kissed for several hours straight no i want a nap and my own space for a while
this post deserves more upvotes gee the air is dusty all of a sudden
this just made me teary üò≠ my beloved family dog passed away a week and a half ago and everything you said about your cat rings so true for her as well ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
i did lots of research thought about adopting a rabbit a guinea pig etc the kitten just made the most sense and everything you have listed definitely crossed my mind thank you
i actually adopted two kittens for my two daughters and years old last year for this exact reason it sounds like they meant so much to you growing up and i m hoping my daughter s have that exact experience thanks for sharing
they‚Äôve been the best companions to me as a little girl with aspergers i couldn‚Äôt understand people very well but i sure could understand animals
i feel this in another level except with my dog she made shitty experiences i had to face at such a young age a little less shitty just by licking my tears
my son credits the bond with his cat for helping him through the tough times in hs
awww i didn t get my first cat until later in life around but i thought i hated cats until i stumbled upon being her owner i remember one time hiding in the closet from my ex crying and she bumped her little head on the door and came in and licked my tears on my face purring i never knew you could bond with a cat like that to this day she still loves sleeping right next to me if i m sick or upset and loves to be spooned lol
me too my sister and i got two kittens when i was and she was her cat bobo lived to be she got sick and developed a seizure disorder but my cat molly got to the ripe old age of she was basically the family cat and we all adored her i ll forever have all the wonderful memories of growing up with her
i felt the same thing my th or th birthday present was a kitten i picked out a scrawny timid snuggly little tortoiseshell and my mom said she looked like a turd i insisted she was the one years later she‚Äôs curled up on my lap purring it will absolutely break me when its time for her to go but i wouldn‚Äôt trade a day of it
beautifully said i hope this little girl has the same wonderful experience with her kitten as you did
this reminds me so much of the cats i had when i was younger god just bringing back a lot of memories üò≠
i find that hard to believe horses can be had for real cheap or even free if you know where to look and aren t too picky like if you want an akc purebreed sure it could cost you a grand or more but check out your local humane society and you ll find tons of mutts that can gaurd your house or play with your kids just as good
naw the babies are reasonable it s after they grow up and get trained that they cost an arm and leg
probably not i have two purebred arabians both with outstanding bloodlines‚Äî great granddaughters of bask negatraz negativ aladdinn etc one was bailed from a kill pen for one was adopted free to an approved adopter they re both gorgeous wonderful mares
you would be surprised how many horses there are under probably most of them
that foal would probably sell for no less than k judging by the way it moves the minute a human starts putting time into it the price just starts going up
depending on gender and pedagree if he gets gelded its probably few thousand more if sold when older and trained if she is a filly she is probably over perhaps double that my eye isn t that good for that range i havent a clue what stallions run for but if they are good it is well into figures it s hard to tell from a
might be arabians don t bring quite as much generally as some other breeds for dressage but high level prospects go for k and up six figures is not unheard of
the odds were slim and you still lost my condolences
as an equestrian i can see how someone who doesn‚Äôt know the sport might see dressage as boring but actually it‚Äôs kind of like ballet for horses it takes tremendous discipline and communication between horse and rider in order to perform those complex movements and the horses themselves need to be amazingly conditioned and muscular in order to execute them the more you know
dressage is very difficult for both the horse and the rider
as one of my dressage friends explained it you try and make a kilo animal dance
really wow ok what am i missing seems like a great way to get to a deeper conversation
gt loads of tattooed piercings etc gt turns out she was a competitive dressage rider in other words rich daddy issues
us dressage riders are way more fit than you realize it takes an incredible amount of core strength to hold your body in the correct position while still moving with the horse plus using just the right muscles to apply just the right amount of signal to just the right place
did the same thing spent a solid minutes talking about the reason i didn‚Äôt go to university because i didn‚Äôt want to waste my money on a degree in something i wouldn‚Äôt use because i didn‚Äôt know what i wanted to do and that photography is one of the worst degrees i know off because some of the most talented photographers i know did have to go university to learn it turned out she did that and made for an awkward drive home
non horse people always think that and i mean it‚Äôs kind of the point in that the rider should look still and motionless and like they‚Äôre just sitting there but once you actually try riding and see the kinds of maneuvers they perform you gain a lot of appreciation for all of the extremely subtle cues they‚Äôre constantly giving as well as the muscle control it takes to give that effortless appearance dressage becomes a lot more interesting and beautiful once you realize that
many females like dressage so don t put down dressage even if you hate it kind of like vaulting a lot of female dressage riders were vaulters when they were young i m not sure what discipline you ride but if you haven t ridden english yet i suggest you try it for a month you will never go back to western and your legged kiddo will thank you for it
every time you leave i try my best to look real cute don t close the door yet friend because i m gonna wedge my snoot you need to know how much today i loved the walks with you n i was hopin maybe that it wasn t quite yet thru i m ready now this minute if you wanna walk some more that s why i stuck my snoot out you don t need to close the door the walks are everything to me my favrit time of day so even if we don t go out hey fren you wanna stay
and the inevitable fingers on the snoot ‚Äúsorry bud you gotta stay here‚Äù üò≠
that is a pro iwuvu face it‚Äôs always worked just say no to them it catches them off guard then they get the drama snuff flops on the floor rinse repeat because it‚Äôs so much drama it‚Äôs funny as shit add some whiny noises and the up the drama then go for a treat no drama till tomorrow
you think this is bad i have to deal with a german shep that apparently thinks he s a cat i have to put him in his kennel and he just rubs against my legs with his head and tries to figure eight i usually end up going in with him and giving him some hugs and he plops right down
geneticists figured out in that certain narrow dog snoots like the one we see on magnus evolved in the very first human civilizations which used doors for this very reason
nice work for a second i thought you painted it at baskin robbins
that is really awesome great moment this made me smile
wait paint him getting the toy back please please please
this is beautiful what brand of watercolors brush did you use i‚Äôm just starting out myself and trying to learn as much as i can
well done much more talent than me in other news however all your colors above look like variants of baby poo
you paint what you think not what you see i love it
hi i‚Äôm op‚Äôs sister how can i contact you to purchase this amazing pic
do you use a pencil to create the lines in your watercolor
really wholesome piece of art thanks for posting it
aww you all are awesome hosts thank you for making all these changes in your lifestyle to accommodate them and looking out for the duck fam you are good people
if could you would have a few coins you re a good person mate
you re much more patient than me i used to do my best to scare the adults away before they d lay eggs
if my wife was here she would say there is a special place in heaven for animal lovers like you
is it possible to remove all the duck poop from the water
my parents did this and when mama duck left of her ducklings got left behind be on the lookout for strays once mama leaves because she s probably not coming back for them esp with you can feed them yourself with chicken feed and one day when they re big enough to fly they ll be gone you might be in for a long pet duck experience
please tell me you re compiling these and you re going to release a book of poetry i would buy it immediately
of all the reddit regulars you re easily my favourite i hope this account is around for many years to come
i love you i always have the biggest smile after reading your poetry please don t ever stop
i was half expecting for the picture to come to life
i know you re joking but i m like actually annoyed by how good it is and i don t know why maybe it s like how something can be so bad it s good but this time it s reversed
even before seeing comments my first thought was op is a jerk lol
it s amazing what a box of prismacolors will do in the right hands
for anyone who remembers the meta from the wip post nice job op fuck you
same here it s not just this though i hv a deep rooted hatred for anyone with exceptional talent so for example the sistine chapel really bothers me lebron james motzart etc hate and resent them all
my vintage by pok√©mon standards plush pikachu is annoyed by how good this is or i‚Äôll just claim he is
i m offended by have not calling it an african american pencil
fuck you ever think that the more effort ops put into making you believe they drew it the less you believe it i m convinced this is just a printed image that they re pretending to draw on
such an awesome example of how strength and power isn t about big muscles
great for him and his coach seems awesome but man watching that made me nervous as hell
serious question could he risk injury if he s not able to maintain correct form can they make it safer for him to lift i take it the belt has something to do with that
gt miles taylor lbs deadlifts lbs love everyone coming out the woodworks to see this kid accomplish such a feat so wholesome
i wonder if i could lift that stuff i have a bad back and weak knees would probably be something i had to build up to
love how almost the whole gym stops everything they re doing and just comes over to check him out this is great camaraderie
i love all the huge dudes arriving at the end to congratulate him that kid must be a living legend at his gym and fucking deservedly so
my brother has much more severe cerebral palsy and this is honestly making me cry i love his miles‚Äô reaction i love the coach‚Äôs reaction and i love everyone just coming out of nowhere to watch this go down it‚Äôs beautiful
i‚Äôve seen both videos that is very impressive good on him
damn kudos to his friend for sticking by and helping him
christ deadlifting like that puts you at such severe risk of injury that i could almost say it s guaranteed sooner or later sooner probably i m not trying to take anything away from the kid dude s got cerebral fucking palsy and is ripping off the ground something most able bodied people can t even do nonetheless i hope no one thinks that form is ok if you have to do what he did there to get the weight up then you need to decrease the weight you will regret it
could he sustain injury surely but i think it is fair to say they were using lower weight than his realistic max strength allows him to because as you can see his form breaks down because his motor control is not perfect because of his condition regardless i ve seen other clips with the guy and i think his coach puts great emphasis on form and they don t do these high intensity records very often
you always risk injury lifting heavy stuff yes i think his disability increases this but he s obviously into it and is going to do it anyway the belt should help if he can flex his abs when lifting
well sure if all you do is sit around your living room and play video games of course you ll never get injured but what s the point of that
yes at max weights deadlifting carries significant risk and atlas stone lifting moreso the point of the lifts is that they are very difficult and require training a lot of people would say you shouldn t put limits on a disabled person but in these lifts you re dealing with actions that require a lot of mental and physical cues to do them right i m an abled bodied powerlifter lifter of years experience with an engineering degree and i ll get a deadlift wrong of the time so you re right to be concerned however this gif doesn t explain that miles trains in an elite gym among powerlifting champions and huge names in the sport i m sure he s also had plenty of assessments with his doctor he s in good hands and i daresay less injury prone than me
his name is miles taylor i follow him on instagram i think he goes by smiles taylor
the greater risk comes in not challenging himself to his limits besides there are lots of big strong guys around him to help out if need be nothing ventured nothing gained
yup endorsing this guy to deadlift and cheering him for the form he is unfortunately required to use because of his condition is insanely irresponsible if the day comes where he just pops a disc in his spine i wonder what this trainer will say then
i was about to say lbs isn‚Äôt something any push over can handle at lbs but it‚Äôs certainly no great feet for just a mildly strength trained person source am lbs haven‚Äôt visited gym in years but work a job stocking heavy material max about ish
i think my cats would disagree but i agree to your point
still trying to tell myself that an aggressive dog jumped a fence and i broke my arm a few months ago still hurts the dog wasn t dealt with and it and most dogs now scare the shit out of me
but we wouldn t know if they weren t here in fact there may be a thing like dogs that we don t have that a parallel universe is enjoying and posting it would be a sad place if we didn t have gallopelgools i guess the lesson is be happy with what you have and hug your dog
gt the world would be a sad place if dogs weren‚Äôt here be glad we made them
going through a divorce and i don t know what i would do without my dogs now they give my life a bit of normalcy with all the change
gt if dogs weren‚Äôt here you want planet of the apes because that s how you get planet of the apes
a world without perytons would also be a sad place edit ooops wrong timeline
that was nice but pump the brakes brometheus it‚Äôs am for some of us
i like how you capitalized all the references to the dog as if he were a god
i like your way to explain purity of dog s love well said here friends already made a meme of me always saying that a dog is loving by its very nature it s probably time to give them sone more material
i once commented that this type of behaviour is the definition of good got down voted but darnit i still believe it
this made me really feel the love between me and my doggo i have always felt that strong bond between us and you put it in words
it s not love it s literally programming through training lol c mon now people
dog probably also understands owner food and shelter
nah the dogs worried he won‚Äôt have a good source they‚Äôre not that smart
dogs are i think very wise they don t want much out of life and are very content when they get it they know what s important and what doesn t really matter shelter food walks quality time with their favourite person they don t want much more
to quote byron dogs possess ‚Äúbeauty without vanity strength without insolence courage without ferosity and all the virtues of man without his vices ‚Äù
must not cry must not cry i‚Äôm not crying you‚Äôre crying
if he s not worried about what happens to him wouldn t the dog just be doing it because he loves you without any concern for whether you give him that love in return
or he thought his owner was dead already and wanted first dibs on the face meat
i think you were right up until the on the off chance he ll get the love in return part i don t think a dog is motivated by getting anything in return they just love they have love so they give it unselfishly thats it nothing about getting anything back that s all well and good but its not a motivator
how i feel as a parent never understood selflessness till i had kids everything else just gets disregarded when you‚Äôre trying to keep your kids safe
child like children are the most selfish little c bombs of all
i mean to be fair i think we also sort of trained them to have that response we are the source of all comfort in their lives without us they have nothing its likely a fear response but then again isn t love also the fear of losing
right in the fucking feels man i m tearing up here in work
tbh i don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happened to that guy but if i were in a position resembling that i‚Äôd probably just want my puppy too
the dog was so happy and excited he peed all over him
i don t think it s just hug if you look it looks like he is like yep you coming with me boy i won t leave you
we seriously dont deserve dogs what amazing creatures
omg what happened next did the guy maake it please update
he did what jon snow couldn t do with perfectly find hands
cat looks like it s ready to step out for a pack of cigarettes
nothing beautiful about it a stressed mother cat and an irresponsible owner promoting animal breeding
just look at these fluff balls so loving am me oh what have i done a mistake this must be my puppies her kittens all snuggled around aw geez i can t breathe this whole place stinks like hound they fluffy n frenly we all live as one hey b tch get me outta here this is no fun we gather together a family blended dear god i am dreaming my nine lives have ended
yup that look on momma cat s face in the beginning is all i need to know about the situation that s gonna be a chaotic house for the next months
the cat is like why did you place me next to this dog
gt cat is like what have i done postpartum depression dogs are immune
facts his ears are down and his eyes are large and twitchy his face also twitches quite a bit
i ve never seen that much shell shock on a cat before
gt the cat is like what have i done cat where in my life did i fuck up so bad to end up sleeping with and even having kids with a golden retriever
my logic as a kid was have you ever seen a cat penis
i have a male cat and a female dog and whenever i tell that to anyone they say the exact same thing seems like a very common thing for kids to think
that s actually pretty common for some reason a lot of modern society has a bias to see dogs as masculine and cats as feminine which iirc is why often serial killers who target women will kill cats in their childhood to give a really dark example
i remember thinking same thing at around age no freakin idea why either
i thought the same thing my only theory is because in homeward bound the dogs were both boys and the cat was a girl
i thought this too and told a lot of adults who laughed at me
because old people do that too my wife and i had a boy and girl cat and a boy and girl dog no matter how many times we would correct them both my wife s grandparents called both the dogs boys and both the cats girls the vast majority of old people i know do this
it s ok when i was a kid i thought people in egypt lived in pyramids i ve heard others say the same thing on here so i dont feel quite as dumb i m sure someone else out there thought what you did but honestly that is kind of fuckin stupid
when we were little my brother told me all cats are girls and all dogs are boys except for poodles which are both intersex
i feel like when i was a kid a lot of cartoons had a male dog and a female cat
i made the association as a kid that dogs are like boys because you can play with them by wrestling throwing the ball or just play rougher in general cats are like girls because you have to be gentle with them and you can only lightly pet them or cuddle with them
because dog behavior is often associated as male who‚Äôs a good boy ‚Äù and cat behavior is often associated as female a ‚Äòcatty‚Äô girl
i was just telling my wife a few days ago i had the exact same beliefs as a child wtf
lmaoooooooo saaaaaame now that i‚Äôm an adult this naive conception has crept up on me in new ways for example i look at this video and go ‚Äúomg look it‚Äôs me and my bf ‚Äù
i believed this too and wondered how they could raise babies together if they hated each other
i used to think cats were girls and dogs were boys glad i‚Äôm not the only one also bees are girls wasps are boys lions are boys tigers are girls
my mom thinks of all dogs as masculine and all cats as feminine because that s how the words are in german
now you know that both of them are mothers and they‚Äôre probably together to help each other until the massive child support payments start rolling in from their dead beat baby daddies
because kids grow up in a world where dogs are ‚Äúman‚Äôs best friend‚Äù and identified with masculine symbolism whereas cats are identified with feminine symbols and referenced in stuff like ‚Äúcrazy cat ladies‚Äù subtle but helps to blur a child‚Äôs perception
me too also thought all boys were older than girls because my dad is older than mom at the same time i was friends with the younger neighbor boy kid logic
it s such a common childhood misconception and yet the gender alignment is consistent i ve always found that fascinating
my sister thought that about lions being dads and tigers being moms
i was really hoping they would start passionately kissing each other while the family stood in shock
i definitely got a love affair vibe from them i didn t think i d ever see you again
iirc there s actually a recent simpsons episode with a similar plot to what you just described this reunion would mean more to them if that s really the case
literally my first thought i m queer so i pride myself on my gaydar and it was flashing real hard for these guys my only hope is that their lives have been happy and that they can come to terms with who they are at some point
honestly you may be on to something judging by the body language during the long hug ol tex was obviously happy to see his old friend and hugged him but seemed to be not nearly as into it as the visitor so maybe it was an unrequited thing
too bad one of them is only being kept alive by a mysterious entity that s living inside his body
well yeah you can see the heat from that steamy gay hug warp the doorframe
dear henry last night with you was bliss i fear my orgasm has left me a cripple i don t how how i shall ever get back to work war i love you madly john p s loved the cabin
why else not see someone you care for for over years
while funny comments like this are why men are afraid to be affectionate with each other p
we always have this conversation when someone posts pictures of old soldiers don t know if it s the physical punishment they had to go through or something psychological after the fact that makes them stay in great shape but something about ww ww vets who stay young their whole lives
i‚Äôm and got a beer gut all that military training vs my liquor store training
i would have guessed they were nearly at the oldest
first thing i thought when i saw them together most adults i know at that age or younger are already have a stooping posture but these guys look great
seriously the friend looks like he could bench press a car
yup that‚Äôs exactly when it hit me too just beautiful
i turned this shit on for like seconds and had to fucking jam it off
i feel that part hit a lot of us because we have empathy for him although most of us can‚Äôt relate to seeing a war buddy from years ago the majority of us can relate to seeing someone we thought we‚Äôd never see again or imagine what it would feel like if we did see that one person we thought we‚Äôd never see again
reddit makes me cry at work too much maybe i should actually do some work and stop crying in front of the computer amp x b nah
i m crying on the toilet rn at least i have some charmin ultrastrong to wipe my tears
oh god seriously and then when the dad goes ‚Äòthis is my good good buddy‚Äô it was too much for me
imagine what these guys would‚Äôve gone through together at one point literally putting each other‚Äôs lives in each other‚Äôs hands at point a bond incredibly difficult to understand
schnoodledoodledo was just thinking about your awesome poems yesterday and so glad to find your new one here
great thanks now i feel like a piece of shit for going to work this morning
this just made me miss my dog so much i cant wait to get off work and see her now
i sincerely appreciate this tip i m in my upper s and still get carded sometimes when i buy alcohol i work out a lot and my father is and people think he s so i feel like i have good genetics on my side as well either way thanks again i ll remember this advice
i ve decided my purpose in live is to serve as a living example of what not to do since it s too late for me you are right
this made me happy to read reminds me a bit of my mom she s and she says something she likes about being a mother is that i make her feel younger and she definitely looks that way she still gets carded for alcohol and honestly could pass for somebody in their late twenties
my grandma is legit looks years younger when she goes shopping with her eldest daughter they tell everyone they are sisters nobody questions it my grandmas has a fitness tracker and puts in k steps every day not from exercise just from doing work around the house and she prepares super clean healthy meal my grandpa her husband of years is years old not as mobile with a bad hip but he eats everything she makes him so he s doing alright too
i find that judicious amounts of sleep help as well
got it siphon the life force off the younger people thanks
it s just sad that many people don t have the ability to have kids and i hope there s a way for them to stay young as well
their youthfulness that keeps me alive oh yes found the vampire
my wife s grandfather thought he was dying mid late s for a long as i knew him my wife was the only family to live nearby when he got great grandbabies he was rejuvenated lived happily until he died a few years ago and great grandma is still kicking at
i m just hitting and was looking like i was started exercising daily cutting alcohol and pop drastically and now i m getting told i look i m ten years younger and most important i don t feel old
that and do things that help keep your mind sharp good tool for that is video games that require hand eye coordination though pokemon go is probably the best since you get some good excercise while playing
definitely the case my grandfather lived with us for a good years he used to collect my younger brother from school do a bit of gardening from time to time bearing in mind he was at the start of this his rather quick decline only really started when my brother finished school it really drove home for me how much a sense of purpose or obligation is necessary to keep us going amp x b it s also fantastic for your grandchildren i can t express how nice it was having what was essentially a third parent around
makes so much sense eather they keep you young or you make the old too
it‚Äôs not really because of what you did physically or mentally people that look younger than they are is because of the pure luck of the draw of genetics that‚Äôs it
are you lich who has mastered the art of sucking life span from other living organisms
i am the dog what s this i see my favrit treat am offered me don t grab too fast first act aloof don t wanna be a greedy goof but o m g i gets a taste this way too good a chance to waste with eager glee this treat enthralls i dance n swing my big pink balls
my husband has started to refer to our great dane puppy mos as truck nuts because they re so big and dangly you can t help but notice them
you and me pink balls we see and now we are both filled with glee
back in the day balls on a male dog were just funny but not rare now it s funny that people react to them like it s an oddity üòÖ
when i was growing up dogs had balls i remember that you‚Äôd have company over and the dog would come into the room and everybody would awkwardly avoid looking at these big balls then the dog would hump a kid and everyone would have a good laugh
not to make assumptions but an intact pitbull with docked ears uhhhh
omg the owner didn‚Äôt have his balls chopped off that‚Äôs insane leave dog‚Äôs manparts alone
ah fantastic thanks for sharing your discovery with the class
my daughter has a bunch of rats and the balls are incredibly prominent on the males their scrotums are almost the size of their heads we call them their rat pouches inspired by the english dub of pom poko that refers to tanuki scrotums as raccoon pouches
it would have been such a power move if you didn t add the correction
it s weird when you point it out that s ball you see
it s hard to get such an excitable breed to be so patient that is one very well trained dog
first thing i noticed too un snipped pitbulls make my heart sad we kill so many thousands of them a year
our dog is the sweetest gentlest dog in the world when it comes to treats when we are out walking i can give her a treat in motion and she only opens her mouth for me to put the treat into her mouth but when we get home she always gets a treat before going into the living room she just snaps at the treat and almost bites my fingers off
god i fucking hate these ‚Äúoops look at my hilarious typo ‚Äù comments if it was an actual accident you wild just did such a lazy karma grab
doesn‚Äôt even say you actually edited it you had just put that there lol
man your name made me remember burn notice i miss that show
i ve seen you plenty of times with your wonderful doodledo s i was worried for a bit there on how you re going to incorporate the ummm male counterweight but you never disappoint lmao
the thing was that it was at the garage side of my house there‚Äôs no window at that side
this is great advice and should be higher up well assuming you re not being sarcastic
we may need to do some bird math here but i doubt a bird would suffocate in a cardboard box on the other hand it could get pretty hot without ventilation if the box is in the sun
i once found a hawk that had been attacked half of its wing was missing so i called the local nature center to see if they could help and they said to just let nature run its course it broke my heart to just leave him there
when i was a kid saw a bird slam into a window and was stunned had an aspca nearby so i cup the bird in my hands walk over to the aspca walk in open my hand and explain what happened bird wakes up and starts flying around im like sorry and sheepishly walk out
i once flushed out a young dove out of a bush by my house by accident he sat in the grass nearby being very still so i left him alone i came back out to find him halfway down the gullet of a large black racer snake
where would i find a rehab facility once found a sparrow in that state and spent an hour calling veterinarians animal control the city office and no one wanted to do anything because it wasn‚Äôt endangered we put it in a shaded area with some brush with some water and food it was gone the next day but we had no idea what to do
a bird once does into my house then tried to fly back out again and got stunned i just put it outside and it flew off
what causes the long recovery this happens occasionally at our house and is the bird too disoriented to fly they seem ok but i would think their natural instinct would be to fly away best as possible than let a potential predator close enough to touch
liberty wildlife takes care of injured baby birds they are volunteers trained to do this obviously not needed in this case but in areas where they operate they are a good resource
found a seagull frozen up just like this literally in the middle of the road no cars stopped they just kept driving over it and it was just sitting there as cars went over its head quickly grabbed it to put it on some grass surprisingly yeah it let me pick it up and carry it which was unexpected it then just sat there on the grass staring right through us then outta nowhere he just snapped back to reality and flew off super wierd it was like it was in a semi conscious state surprised it didn t have a damn heart attack from all the car wheels narrowly missing it
he didn t edit it his name has no asterisk next to it
oh yes the freudian slip where you say one thing but you mean your mother
incorrect the freudian slip is when you say one thing and then fuck your mother
freudian slip when you say one thing and mean your mother
in polish we ve got a different saying for situations like this roughly translated it s the hungry one has bread on their mind
is that where you mean one thing but fuck your mother
i‚Äôm pretty sure the other names are just out of frame
i am withholding my upvote because of it oh who am i kidding i m gonna upvote these nameless bois and lassie s but i need to know the name of the doggo in the bowtie if anyone can find it
it s bothering me are there names on the other side of the pictures because the math doesnt add up
i m kind of annoyed their names are more human than dog names
i too did this and am furious that two doggos are not represented they will never be forgotten
you‚Äôre right there‚Äôs two unnamed heroes on another note mcaplin is wearing a bow tie and he definitely looks like a bow tie kind of pup

reddit only likes statistics that fit the narrative
it s not exactly an uncommon breed nitpicky it s not a pit either it s an american bully
you know how the russians and the alt right are using social media to make us all read stuff favorable to them well there s also a pit bull lobby doing the same thing
there is a shareblue but for pit bulls i can‚Äôt remember the details but basically some nervous rich white woman funds these incredibly organic posts
bully not a pitbull i see way more golden retrievers than all bully breeds combined on this subreddit
wtf is it with this person and hating on other peoples preferences its their opinion not yours
cos pitbulls are good and loyal fogs unlike other breeds
is she friendly misbehaving i m curious to know the behavior of a feral cat who freaks out indoors
just please please please make sure they stay with the mom long enough and see a vet before you give them away
if you can get people to adopt kitties together that s always good i got my two feral kittens at a really young age but they learned from each other
my cousin s cat is like that prefers the street lifestyle but likes to have a home to return to and food of course he s more of a roommate than a pet
please get her spayed after the kittens can stop nursing
weve kept many litters on porches growing up just be watchful and give them a safe space if mom doesnt like it she will move them somewhere else we did have one unfortunate year a stray dog jumped our fence and killed all the kittens except one which was found by a neighbor still barely breathing houses down she grew up into the sweetest cat i ve ever had
make sure you socialize the mom cat first search up flatbush cats on youtube they have some great guides on socializing a feral kitty
just make sure you don‚Äôt give them away for free online at least it‚Äôs different if you have friends who want them some people see free kittens as free snake food so you gotta put at least a little bit of a price on their heads
the kitten lady on youtube has a lot of advice for helping kitties most of her videos revolve around orphaned kittens but you can find some on how to take care of them with mama around too definitely worth a watch best of luck and make sure to get them all fixed too
are you sure she s feral we used to have a cat that looked exactly the same and she was just an aggressive bitch
where are you located need any amazing homes near seattle
are you sure that was the first kitten she may have had another before that and is trying to get it to get it
good on you there are programs every now and then where you can get cats fixed for free or insanely cheap
thank you on behalf of humanity i took a t n r course years ago if a person can t keep the cat s the next best thing is to have them fixed and returned to where they were found
unfortunately we can‚Äôt keep any kitties translation we are keeping all of the kitties we just have not realized that yet good luck finding them new homes
she ll get used to being in eventually do it gradually but don t let her out forever it s dangerous out there for cats
please also make sure to get a bell on her collar feral cats are absolutely terrible for local wildlife and will wipe out the small animal population if you re adopting her she no longer needs to hunt and if she s going to spend time out doors your local ecosystem will thank you for putting an alarm system on that little ecosystem destroyer
mommy cat looks like she means business feral indeedy
the epitome of responsible pet adopter you alright in my book
please don‚Äôt keep her as an outdoor cat cats are devastating invasives that are better kept inside
why can t you just let her live outside not understanding why you would make a cat freak out intentionally probably the best motivations here but getting her spayed and letting her live where she wants to live might be best
are you close to ohio i d be open to adopting one of the kittens if you need someone
i d be open to adopting a kitten i m in ohio if you are close to ohio
give her a box or in a quiet part of the house put some rags or t shirts in there she ll prob move them from box to box occasionally and when she does wash the bedding
you ll regret it eventually don t fuck with feral cats
you ll regret it eventually don t fuck with feral cats
the mommy will get extremely depressed if you separate her from the babies too early and the babies won‚Äôt fair well either
they need to stay with their mom for at least months also don t fix her until the months passed
feral cats aren t the best pets she s liable to be extremely skittish around people the rest of her life no matter what you do just be aware of that
i took in a pregnant stray too we stopped letting her outside after she gave birth for fear of if anything happened to her while out she struggled with not being able to go out for awhile but she eventually settled in and was happy to be an indoor cat the major struggle was getting her to use a litter box at first she was totally disinterested until we bought a special litter that has a special smell which i guess is an outdoor smell we slowly started to mix it with normal litter until she was weaned off it using actual dirt from outside might work too if your cat has similar issues in the end i think it‚Äôs safer for them we also ended up keeping her and getting her fixed we also kept one of her two babies and gave the other to a veterinarian friend we call her ‚Äúlil mama‚Äù haha she‚Äôs not very into most people but she‚Äôs grown super attached to my mom and just wants to cuddle with her and sit on her lap all the time we took her in around
my elderly cat harry is snuggled up to me purring right now he‚Äôs my mama‚Äôs boy he also came into the world the same way those kittens did like these kittens he and his brothers had the good fortune to be rescued by someone as kind as you
i can t tell how enclosed she is from the picture but she would probably appreciate a safe quiet space you can even get a cardboard box from a store and put a towel or blanket in it
she looks like a junior kitten herself she‚Äôs probably under a year old
i have a cat of this breed interestingly she was also pregnant when she came to us she is the smartest and friendliest cat i ve ever had or seen
can u plz keep one so she doesnt think shes a failure at naturestuff

feral cat would not approach you like this that s gotta be someone s pet
we had the same thing happen to us i had sort of adopted a feral cat and eventually it began coming inside she would come and get fed every morning and evening from me and she started putting on some weight she was pregnant and gave birth in our hall closet we kept one of the kittens and the mama they were great additions to the family
use peroxide to get the blood or any body stains out of the white material it s what they use for lab coats and stuff i promise no weirdness but for real it works
kinda fucked up to take the mom in and get rid of her kittens
thank you for giving her a safe place to have her babies
mom will probably try to take them outside eventually which is the most unsafe place possible for a kitten see if you can try to habituate her to people somewhat before you let her back outside also maybe she can learn to trust you
you re doing a very kind amazing thing but i have to point out that outdoor cats are a huge no nowhere remotely near enough people recognize that idc how normalized it is and how much happier you think the cat is it s a fact look into it please huge hazard to wildlife huge hazard to other pets that are on other people s property hazard to people and it puts the cat into harm s way on an exponential level compared to be indoors with only controlled outdoor visits i brought in a feral cat myself this cat was bird fueled flea ridden wild in the eyes terrified inside but i acclimated her properly and patiently rather than letting her continue to have free reign outside because it was the responsible thing to do i still have her almost years later and she couldn t be more content not trying to be preachy but honestly it has to be said
please please please vaccinate mama asap at a farm and feed store for an fvrcp dose it s too early for the babies but she ll pass antibodies through her milk
wouldn t it be easier to adopt a kitten than a feral cat though the kitten has a better chance of being happy as a half indoor cat
i had a similar situation to this mom only wanted to stay inside until the kittens were no longer nursing she‚Äôs now strictly outdoor i gave of the kittens to friends and their doing well i kept the the runt and she turned out to be the biggest and acts more like a dog than a cat she follows me everywhere and she talks to me a lot i‚Äôve had cats all my life and never had one so talkative
yay for keeping the mom i love the look on her face oh great these again nice to know they ll be the last ones she has to worry about
this is how my parents now have four cats it took mama a looong time but she‚Äôs now quite content inside their house thank you for helping this sweet and scared mama try to get her fixed asap she‚Äôll be a bitch to catch if you let her back out and cats can get pregnant pretty soon after giving birth thank you for taking on the responsibility of these sweet kittens ‚ù§Ô∏è
thank you for giving her a safe place to have her babies and thank you for listening to her when she needed help
you‚Äôre amazing not just for letting her come inside but also for going the distance and doing all these next steps for her one thing and i know how irritating it can be for everyone to now tell you how to properly raise kittens please do try and rehome the kittens either paired up or as a second cat with a suitable playmate already in the home kittens really really need and want to cuddle and play with their siblings and mourn when they‚Äôre suddenly separated from other cats that‚Äôs how people and up with ‚Äúcrazy cats‚Äù they‚Äôre mainly indoors and only surrounded by humans who are out of the house a lot and don‚Äôt speak their language two cats that grow up together make a great pair and will keep each other company
hi do you live in an apartment i saw the stairs you mentioned could you share how to raise a indoor and outdoor cat in a flat
you can probably get them into the humane society s responsibility and foster them so they can get them fixed help your with food litter and vaccines and s n it s expensive if you re gonna fund all this by yourself and please don t send them to homes without neutering i say this as a foster parent with a mommy and kittens they eat and shit like a horse
lameeeee take in a cat that doesn t know what to do sterrilize her and get rid of her kittens it s like she will leave anyway it s a stray cat not a domestic one
be extra careful on who you give them to it‚Äôs a growing problem where people go around rounding up free kittens to feed to there pet snakes once snakes reach a certain size they need bigger more expensive food like small rabbits large rats etc these jerk snake owners either can‚Äôt afford the food or just don‚Äôt care and feed them free kittens our cat had kittens half a year ago and we believe we ran into a couple of these losers when we were ready to adopt them out we felt we couldn‚Äôt trust anyone so we ended up keeping them
outdoor cats kill a lot of wildlife see if you can consider keeping her as an indoor cat only they have much longer life expectancies
something very similar happened to me cat protection told us to keep them all locked in the house together for abot months in case she leaves and doesn t come back the kittens absolutely need their mum for months so you might have to do the same
also get the baby cats fixed when they are old enough a kitten can get pregnant at like weeks old
please charge a hundred dollars or two for each cat it s easy to take them when they are free and god knows they cost way more than that over the course of their lifetime
i don t want to be alarmist but be aware that there are folks who trap outdoor cats and dogs to use as bait in training their dogs for dog fighting it s horrible and folks need to be more aware reconsider having their cats outdoors if they can help it i understand it s not everywhere and many are fine too just trying to let people know
um are you sure this cat is feral did you check whether it s got a chip
my county and neighboring counties do cheaper spay neuter in may you should find out if any vets in your area have a discount
i know you mean well but if the cat is feral she will never be a pet or an indoor cat there s levels of how feral she is i guess but it might be best to keep her until the kittens no longer need her and release her neutered back to her home
hopefully the kittens get fixed too in the future what a cute little family
just make sure you keep her inside until you get her spayed she will get pregnant again way earlier than you expect my parents let us catch and keep some barn cats when we were kids if you can catch them you can keep them and my mom decided to let the female get pregnant for us to experience that she did had some kittens and was pregnant again before we could get her spayed i think she was still nursing it was at like weeks or something like that after that litter she was on house arrest until she got spayed ü§£ rip mariah the bestest kitty she and her bro lived to be
how can you be sure it was feral and that no one is missing it rn
nothing wrong with that i got my cat because a family took in a pregnant stray and adopted out the kittens through a local rescue the rescue took care of getting all the kittens neutered and placed in homes
youre keeping the mom but taking away her children youre a fucking monster
how does the mom respond to you guys amazing she came to you for help but maybe she s better just going back to her life after getting fixed and keeping a kitten instead
hopefully this experience lets mom know that inside your home is a safe place for her and she ll settlle in a bit
she may settle down my male tuxedo is a former feral and he gets calmer and calmer the longer we have him
we adopted a feral cat some years ago and she still doesn‚Äôt like to be inside more than a few meters from the door chances are she could become loving as ever but won‚Äôt be an inside cat
i ve adopted a few ferals but only after they d been in the human society aspca system for a number of months aren t you concerned that the moment you open the front door you ll never see her again one of my ferals lived with us for like years finally snuck out when a friend opened the door for a few seconds too long and we never saw her again granted she didn t have any kittens at our place
we adopted a feral cat five or six years ago she hated humans for about a week we had to keep her in a cage then suddenly was the nicest cat i had ever seen within a day never had problems she comes and goes as she pleases and can easily feed herself her kitties though they re all lazybois try as she might to teach them to hunt and climb which is honestly the most adorable thing i ve ever seen
please condition her to be inside outdoor cats are terrible for native bird populations
she may settle down to being indoors once she‚Äôs spayed i‚Äôm sure she‚Äôs just stressed because she‚Äôs somewhere unfamiliar and now has babies to take care of thank you for caring for her ‚ù§Ô∏è
keep her inside long enough so she knows where home is we kept our cats inside for months after moving also it ll be safer for the kittens
i always wondered how does the cat agree to giving away her kitties one day she feeds one of her babies and the next the baby s gone how does she react to it i assume there will be tantrums sorry i don t own pets
tip maybe have mama cat get injected with a tracker incase something happens to her and she winds up at a shelter
i adopted a stray and for the first few years i tried so hard to make him an indoor cat but he always found a way out then luckily i moved into a house with a vinyl fenced in backyard that he can‚Äôt get out of so we‚Äôre both happy now he can go out in the yard but he can‚Äôt roam and i know he‚Äôs safe
dogs are notorious for being difficult to train so it always makes me smile when i see one that is now if only someone could train mine to stop jumping on the counters
at least it s supported on his shoulder but repetition will still train the pups muscles maybe he switches sides some days
my dog sleeps in contorted positions only the more uncomfortable he looks the more comfortable he is
i think about this alot when i hold my puppies if you see the way the dog is positioned and imagine the dog standing on all fours with its neck in the same position times out of you will see that a dog holds their head further upright than expected i hope that makes sense if not dogs rule i want karma
it‚Äôs not dogs range of motion let‚Äôs their heads go straight up take your dog to the vet and say they arf if they bend their neck too much you‚Äôll watch in astonishment as your vet will bend your dogs neck beyond what you thought was possible
oh my god i just had a horrible flashback to a book i read as a child
i just had a horrible flashback to a book i read as a child
i too have a chihuahua mix he does this all the time it doesn t even have to be trained
lol my dog stays in crazy positions for hours at a time dog is fine
if you think about it small dogs spend almost all their time looking up so maybe it s not a stretch the shoulder is likely a decent rest too
have you seen how dogs sleep mine contorts her neck way worse when sleeping
my mom s chihuahua does this she seems fine i m sure if the dog in the post were to be too uncomfortable they d change
pics or it didn t happen or it did happen but we don t get to see it
velocity c that would be my dream come true and you are awesome
this is making me nervous i just rescued four stray kittens and i am starting to get attached i better find homes for them soon or i am going to be stuck with all of them i ll probably keep the black longhair as it is
i feel that my cat mamas adopted my gf days before popping out floofy girls and silky boys we still have them all
there was a truly feral cat in the neighborhood that dumped a sick kitten on our back porch once we took it to the vet and they adopted it out and within a week she had dropped the other baby off she came back months later very obviously pregnant and decided she would have them indoors this time on my fkn bed she was completely insane and hyper aggressive she never really adjusted to being owned and eventually disappeared but i still remember her walking around the house after we took her litter to the shelter her meow was a giant eerily human question mark
that s my human wonder if it is an evolved trait even when feral get adopted so babies survive
i have two and i feel like my condo just constantly smells how do you keep up with a litter box for cats
i love you for this act of kindness to a homeless cat momma and her tiny babies how lucky are you
did your mom kitty start getting mad at her offspring when they didn t leave our cat had kittens and we kept two of them but after a couple years she d just hiss at them whenever they d walk bye
i‚Äôm afraid you‚Äôre going to have to cease avoiding your taxes the cat tax is not a voluntary program
apparently it‚Äôs semi common that pregnant moms will seek out a human my friend had a feral cat adopt her a couple of years ago she took it to get fixed and found out she was pregnant web she picked her up surprisingly there‚Äôs no laws again cat abortion in the south
do you think pregnant cats have any idea that they re making more cats or are they just like gahhh something s wrong with me i ve been eating everything and now there are things moving inside me
it s not even just pregnant strays two of my neighbours cats started showing up at my house every day and coming inside for cuddles we don t have a cat door they just wait outside meowing until we let them in as if they live here one of them pretty much only goes home for food
dude this happened to my family when i was yrs old skinny little cat who didnt even look preggo came in our house and had babies in the closet we gave the kittens away and kept the momma she lived to the ripe age of rip puss cats are smart
exactly my story one mama babies with me years just couldn t break the family up
yeah a mother cat approached me and basically had me nurse her two kittens she the mother cat already lived among her own mother and brother and they were greedy and fat gluttons the alpha of the local community this meant her and her kittens would always be hungry so i nursed the kittens to health and over time while i did this the cats began to trust any asian person i m asian including walking up to my brother my next door neighbor adopted both the kittens but unfortunately the mother died in a fight both those kittens look healthy big now and oftentimes when i walk up the stairs to reach my door i see those cats staring at me and meowing through the window townhouse where i live on the upper floor and my neighbor the lower floor and basement
what i think happens in these situations is that someone had the cat and didn‚Äôt spay it then they get out when they‚Äôre in heat and get knocked up rough it for the pregnancy and sidle up to some friendly humans near the end because they recognize humans as a good place for food and safety i also was befriended by a late term cat about years ago when i was in college i couldn‚Äôt keep her tho because i lived in campus housing so we gave her to a friends sister
i see you have posted minutes ago but still no pictures
how was the experience dealing with an adult feral cat i‚Äôve seen videos from people who foster feral cats and apparently after weeks old they are extremely difficult to fully acclimate to humans
identical situation happened to me as well about years ago i took in a stray doc tells me she s pregnant at her vet appointment two days later and two days after that i had a momma kitty and kittins the weeks i spent helping with the kittins was so much fun although i barely slept because all four cats lived in my room anyway i adopted the kittens out to my friends and the mother kitty barb is sleeping inches away from me right now good luck op
my family has had that happen to us a few times we had this mom cat that came into our backyard and yelled at our door we noticed right away she was pregnant so we locked up our own pets and lured her into the house with food and she had her babies when we started introducing solids to the babies we had to lock up mommy cat because she wanted that canned food bad all of the babies were adopted through a rescue and so was mom so happily ever after
awww we found a cat or she chose us about years ago and she was pregnant we kept her and the kittens until they were about weeks old and ended up keeping two kittens and the mom and the other three all got adopted together we still call our two ‚Äúkittens‚Äù and people who know us think we‚Äôre crazy but we‚Äôve had them since the day they were born so they‚Äôll always be our little kittens i would have kept all if i could have
what do you do spay and neuter the lot of them and then just live with them
i feel bad because this friendly stray came up to me when i was going to my car for school last year she was being real cute laid down on her back and curled her paws chirping at me and let me pet her stomach i didn t really recognize her because there s another stray cat that looks like her and she was fatter than i remember her nipples were weirdly dark and prominent too later on i realised she wasn t fat she was pregnant because i saw her walking around with kittens a few weeks later i think she was trying to tell me the one human she trusts to take her home because it was time but i didn t understand now she s kinda mean and doesn t come to me when i call for her anymore
it was october i was a freshman in college away from home when i called my parents they mentioned this friendly stray cat had wandered into our neighbors garage turns out she was pregnant she started giving birth so my neighbor called my dad to come over and assist she had a hard time giving birth to her litter and unfortunately two of the six kittens didn‚Äôt make it a third had its cord wrapped tightly around his back paw my dad was able to cut the cords and get the other kittens into decent shape he took them to a vet the next day who said they were all fine but the one who had the cord wrapped around his paw might end up losing the foot my parents ended up taking in that one and sure enough his foot kinda just fell off so we became proud owners of a three and a half legged cat he grew up fine he‚Äôll be in a few months he stays mostly stays indoors and hobbles around the house on his legs
same thing happened to me around years ago stray cat was hanging around my backyard for a few weeks one day she started acting super friendly so i let her inside for awhile and she napped with me on my couch that night she had kittens in my garage i had no idea she was pregnantü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è i still have the ‚Äúkittens‚Äù and they live inside with me the ‚Äúmama cat‚Äù as i call her still likes her freedom outdoors i got them her fixed so we won‚Äôt have anymore surprises and i love the kitties
petition to remove silvers from u velocity c until they deliver the photos amp x b all in favour say aye
if you re gonna keep mixed genders either spay them or get incest
my cat did that too she just came into my house on a rainy day that was yrs ago
that s how this works i was recently adopted by a stray abandoned boy
this cat can go from feral to domestic in seconds if she wishes they learn very quickly that safe warm and well fed plus attention whenever they want it is very nice and her babies are there so you may just have yourselves a cat
i got adopted by a cat she was also pregnant now i have cats
the driver dont choose the car the car choose the driver
alternatively the mom could be indonesian and the dad could be french
okay i ve gotta be that guy the way you put that makes it sound like australian is the same as white which suggests that non whites like your son aren t real australians it probably sounds like a petty nitpick but your son has a whole life of occasional papercuts ahead of him source am a mixed race american and am cool about it until someone casually implies i m not as american as they are

if he was years older you could pull off a really good asian jim gag at the office with him i guess you ll just have to settle for mini me gags
my boyfriend is mixed indo and aussie this makes my heart happy
also please don‚Äôt advertise them as free kittens on craigslist people do messed up things with free animals bring them to the local shelter they will get adopted out pretty much immediately üôÇ
in laws got a kitten and the person said ‚Äúyes weeks old ‚Äù poor gyspy was only eight weeks and soooo small didn‚Äôt learn from mom how to cover her waste after using the litter box so that‚Äôs the catch
and get mom vaccinated and spayed as soon as it s safe to do so
we found a week old kitten a couple of years ago no sign of mom for a long time we brought him home and bottle fed him and once he got a little older our other cats taught him to cat he s become an awesome member of the family
yep this exactly my cat is an adult and extremely healthy but only because i bottle fed him for weeks i got him when he was only weeks old the lady i got him from wanted his litter to stay with their momma the full time they should but her husband told her she either found them a home or he was planning on throwing them in a bag in the river i went and talked to the vet told them what was going on and asked what things i could do to make sure the one i was adopting would be healthy and etc i bottle fed him for i think more weeks iirc before slowly moving him to kitten food i litter trained him he napped on my chest during the day and at bedtime he wouldn t sleep in his carrier at all he got too scared so he slept next to my head on my pillow years later he s still a healthy boy and still likes to sleep right next to my head i was able at that time to take care of him but i do wish very much he had got the time with his mother he was supposed to have
and that they are not given away to class b dealers or animal abusers
and please make sure that the new owners will spray neuter so that unwanted future litters are avoided
yeah my flatmate adopted a kitten that had been separated from his mum far too young he was a nightmare at the start
yea i found a week old that i m bottle feeding it screams constantly i m a little overwhelmed but i m trying she seems to like this tomato box with lid any advice would be welcome there are strays everywhere around the city i live in
check out kittenlady on youtube tons of great information on taking care of kittens it‚Äôll be easier since momma cat is still around but there‚Äôs still a lot of good things to know about caring for neonatal kittens
their mom will also teach them how to hunt cats learn the skill of chomping a mouse in the head to kill it from their mother
this is best i found an abandoned kitten at weeks and he never learned any damn manners they really are better adjusted when they have cat role models
weeks is fine overpopulated areas don t always have the luxury of keeping them with their moms longer and guess what they end up just fine
i agree that weeks is best i always heard an week minimum so when i first got my cat almost years ago i noticed she was pretty small but the people said it was just because she was the runt she was kept outside and was the only one of her litter left after the people told me that they don‚Äôt fix their animals because they ‚Äúlike to give away the babies ‚Äù i decided to take her only to find out from the vet that she was only around weeks old i always felt bad that she was removed from her mother so soon but luckily she is pretty well mannered she has some difficulty controlling her claws sometimes and is still smaller than most cats only around pounds but is healthy i‚Äôm glad that i took her in because the people i got her from obviously were not very responsible with their pets she is such a great companion and i don‚Äôt know what i‚Äôd do without her
and socialize them a lot cuddle them pet them pet their bellies touch their feet ect it will help them be social towards humans feral momma s oddly enough produce feral kittens very easily poor feral kitties ‚òπÔ∏è anyway best wishes to you and the crew
weeks is functional but you have to take an active part in raising them if you re gone at work all day your kitten is spending hours at home alone bored to tears while they re full of rambunctious youthful energy likewise if they spend their formative months mainly by themselves of course they aren t going to be very well socialized if you have time and attention to properly devote to them there s nothing wrong with weeks in most cats amp x b even after weeks kittens are playful and if you re going to be gone at work most of the day you should at least get two so they have someone to play with
that is tooooo long once kittens are weaned there is no reason to subject the mama cat to her kittens trying to nurse with mouths full of teeth
i love this cat mom could ve approached anybody but she was fortunate enough or perhaps knowing enough to approach someone who gave her the help and shelter she needed is willing to give her a home and is being responsible with her kittens i m extremely grateful for you on behalf of those cats
i got mine at ten weeks and she doesn‚Äôt seem to be missing any behaviors or anything
yes i second this kittens need time to learn and be used to socialize and clean themselves toilet amp fur etc i adopted a few cat some left mom early some late those early leavers never use toilet properly pooping outside doors peeing in blankets and always bite and scratch too forcefully while playing because they don t know it hurts and generally very insecure like jumping and fleeing when i sneezed protecting their food bowl when i am nearby late leavers display a lot of good traits including good toilet habit acting very secure with or without me or other cats close by
and try to find adopters that are looking for indoor outdoor cats as these offspring will have that tendency
and try to find adopters looking for indoor outdoor cats these offspring will have those tendencies
and by that time they‚Äôll be wanting to keep all those adorable kittens
is it really i always thought it was i think one of my cats was weeks when we got her
if you let kittens from a truly feral cat stay with her for that long you‚Äôre going to have fearful wild kittens her instincts will ‚Äúrub off‚Äù onto them amp they‚Äôll learn to never feel comfortable around humans we had a completely feral cat she was totally unapproachable that managed to have quite a few litters of kittens in a patch of ivy next to our house we‚Äôd gauge when she was getting close amp then start listening for those squeaky mewling noises that only newborn kittens can make after a little while she‚Äôd run out for a break amp ‚Äúlet‚Äù us come in count them look them over amp put a blanket down i can still remember that the kittens would be hours old amp that feral instinct was so strong that some of them would already hiss at us after we‚Äôd leave her in peace checking in on them every few days until around weeks when their eyes were open amp they were getting ready to start drinking milk replacer amp eating soft canned food on their own we‚Äôd pull them from mom that always felt sad but after leaving prior litters with her before amp having them all turn out exactly like her completely feral we never wanted that again the life of a feral cat is one of the saddest existences there is i still remember that right after we‚Äôd bring the babies in within days at the latest males from all over would just start hounding her non stop after a lot of leg work we ended up finding an amazing organization that specializes in helping feral cats amp we were able to trap her amp finally get her spayed we were so relieved to just be able to help her break free of that constant cycle of pregnancy birth amp lactation the cat in op‚Äôs post doesn‚Äôt seem like she‚Äôs completely feral to me the fact that she was okay coming inside a home amp giving birth there speaks to her being domesticated maybe a generation or two she‚Äôs also probably just a kitten herself since most feral unwanted cats end up pregnant as soon as they can become so she was probably terrified amp was seeking asylum somewhere safe lucky for her she has good instincts made wise choice amp found herself a kind human best of luck
i doubt op will not end up with at least one kitten by then
this is fucked up but wow i will never take in a feral cat knowing this x
my cat nursed her kittens for six months at a year one was still trying to nurse the vet said my mama cat should be the new face of la leche league lol
at the very least or even is better that is when they learn to cat
even better would be weeks read about this a lot if you can manage üòä
i have no idea how i lucked out but i actually adopted my first kitten when he was weeks old a cat gave birth to a litter in someone‚Äôs backyard and they couldn‚Äôt keep any of the kittens just like here i was in contact with the people fairly regularly and they took the cat to the vet and the vet determined he was ok to be apart from his mom he‚Äôs six and a half years old now and he is such a good boy he‚Äôs incredibly attached to me and loves to cuddle like crazy but he had no issues being apart from his mom and growing up normally he‚Äôs smart and lovable and has no issues with anything at all you‚Äôd never know i got him so young not that i would recommend that by any means but if taken care of properly they can be ok
please make sure at least one kitten stays with the mom that‚Äôs definitely important
yeah one of my cats was weeks when we adopted her and had already been away from mom for a week she didn‚Äôt really know how to clean herself and still suckles a lot to this day luckily we adopted a slightly older kitten at the same time and he showed her how to cat
that s how i ended up with my current cat now one year old some friends found kidnapped her and i ended up taking care of and weaning this week old i still had my adult very well maine coon at the time to teach her manners and other not so well behaved cats of other people in the house for her to socialize with she s very well behaved with other cats but she is a jerk to me and has fun testing my patience if i yell at her for playing with something she s not supposed to or knocking stuff of of shelves she just rolls over and purrs she knows nothing i can do to her will phase her and takes advantage of it
one of my cats was a rescue who had been dropped at the spca young she lived as an only cat for years then my brother moved in with me and brought her to live with my cats she didn t know how to wash herself and was stinky after years she learned and is not a stinker anymore i think they must have been shaming her
i heard meowing one night it sounded like a kitten to tbh i ignored it expecting mom to act after half an hour i opened the door and a little black kitten just wandered inside he was tiny like tiny tiny we had to buy formula at walmart that night since it was like midnight long story short the vet said he was about or weeks old we did see momma and one other kitten but he never wanted to go back to mom and they didn t want to get close to me he was the coolest fking cat ever suuuper cuddly and loving we already owned a trained cat and he learned from the older one the other cat hated him but he unconditionally loved him anyways eventually winning him over soo not always
one of my cats was found as a stray when she was months ish i am certain she lost her mom early because she is the worst groomer i have ever seen when she is done cleaning herself a minute process she is soaking wet and her hair is every which way
someone dropped one off in my driveway sometime shortly after its eyes opened use to be a farm and stuff like that happened often he never really adjusted to being a normal cat his meow was off and he was always looking for an animal friend and because his social skills were off it didn t go well he was a good boy though all the way to the end
fr i have one that‚Äôs not long months and she was split from mama at weeks owners didn‚Äôt know better and it was a bit of an emergency to take her i‚Äôm so glad we have a fully grown sensible girl to bap some sense into her she‚Äôs an asshole on springs and no shelf is sacred
i adopted my sweet girl at weeks old she didn t learn any litter box training and had adult fleas visibly crawling all over her body thought it best to get her out of there and i box trained her myself she s a very large lap cat and a bit overweight but we re working on that and i love her to pieces
omg ‚Äúmanners‚Äù cracked me up i got a little monster that my neighbor found at about wks he was so crazy we had to lock him in the bathroom at feeding time cause he‚Äôd inhale his and push my other full grown cats out of the way to eat their food attacked the garbage can and was a food hound for years
found my little dudes at about judging from pictures online weeks there was a terrible thunderstorm flooding high winds torrential downpour the whole thing and there mom was trying to move them but they were stuck in the street the little ones couldn t get over the curb mom was to frightened by all the traffic to get them and the drainage on the edge of the street was getting pretty bad so i took them home tried to go back and find the mom but she wouldn t come near me fast forward almost years and one is still very skittish but has latched onto my wife s older male cat the other he hangs out with our dogs haha
i got lucky with my feral kitten i found at weeks i had an adult cat that adopted her and taught her manners
yeah their mothers smack them and such to get them to behave or learn that fucking hurts pull in your claws as needed funnily enough when i got my cats one of didn t retract her claws enough and was a snuggle bug lots of oh i m bleeding now from razor claws and snuggling when she and the other cat finally got along the other one started smacking her and hissing at her first cat retracted claws more and is now less shit i m bleeding unless i don t trim her nails second cat had just come out of foster care from having had babies so it seems she was still ready to whoop ass in cat etiquette
i adopted a stray kitty he was about weeks and to this day he never learn to bury her poop he just scratch the side of the litter box for minutes
we ve had kittens in my family before and obviously i d witnessed mom cat teaching her babies but this really didn t strike me until i took in a stray kitten off the street little dude did not know how to cat he did very little grooming for himself was slow to pick up on the litterbox thing didn t bury his poop then ran around with poopy paws and meowed constantly there were other things too he was cute but damn if i ve ever met a more ill mannered feline in my life that s when i truly appreciated the role of mom cats
i think this is what happened to one of my rescues she didn‚Äôt clean herself she didn‚Äôt play with toys or anything never really meowed didn‚Äôt cover her business after going potty
mine was weeks but my dog taught him how to be chill
i m considering adopting a little kitten as a child for my adult cats since they can t have babies but if anything they ll teach the little one to get up to all kinds of mischief
both of my cats were found at about weeks old years apart and they re polar opposites aside from that they both love fighting the older one hates almost everyone and everything the younger one loves everyone and everything but doesn t know the difference between playing and fighting the younger one is better socialized because at the same time i took in a third older stray
my brother found a week old feral and decided to keep it he has a main coone and sure enough the kitten started to develop the mannerisms of a main coone
my cat could spend his lives in cat school and have the manners of an asshole some cats are one big mood swing but we tell him he is handsome and sexy and ignore his obvious effects to be a jerk and he allows us to live with him maybe that is his issue
i got my boy when he was weeks he was found without momma cat and they don t know how long they had been apart but i got lucky he s the most loving smart little asshole he just also gets bored and screams if he doesn t get play time
i had to take in a kitten at weeks once because the son of the family that had mama cat was being abusive to the babies it was bad fortunately she learned how to use the litter box and such but i was very much like a mama to her
you could have put on a cat suit and taken on the role ya know for teaching
eh maybe a feral isn t the best role model tho mom might not want kittens socializing with humans
my younger kitty was found abandoned at around weeks i adopted him at months he is so ill mannered compared to my older kitty that lived his first four month with his litter and even at a year old the difference is still striking he s just so high strung
my situation was the opposite i had to take my kitten away from his mom at weeks bc she was teaching him bad manners for just one example his mom would pee and poop everywhere from day i was easily able to litter train him on my own and still to this day his litter mates all have problems with using the litter box
my younger kitty was found abandoned at around weeks i adopted him at months he is so ill mannered compared to my older kitty that lived his first four month with his litter and even at a year old the difference is still striking he s just so high strung having a big brother definitely has been helpful though my older kitty will get onto him for being too rowdy especially at night
i fostered week old kittens that had been dumped in a box i had an adolescent cat at the time that babied them and taught them things but one of them had a lot of litter box problems the people who adopted him sent him back because they didn t want to deal the one i fail fostered still pees somewhere random once in a while and she never trusted anyone other than me for at least years now she trusts the whole family but never visitors so much must be learned in the first few weeks
when we got my cat the vet said that he was only weeks old we learned that it was way too young to separate from his mother but i wouldn t give him up for any other cat
when we got my cat the vet said that he was only weeks old we learned that it was way too young to separate from his mother but i wouldn t give him up for any other cat
we ended up taking in two different feral kittens last spring one at about weeks old and one possibly even younger at the time we had a pet dog as well and he basically adopted them he snuggled with them and licked them until they smelled like stanky dog breath lol now they both seem well adjusted but they do some strikingly dog like things like scratching their ears with their hind legs wagging their tails vigorously it looks super weird but cute and they also learned to come back in the house when i whistle like i used to for our dog oh and they give dog ‚Äúkisses‚Äù aka run up and lick people on the face
so what do you mean by manners does kitty cut in line and tell it like it is without consequence
i found and raised a week old kitten and he has the best manners of any cat i ve had pretty sure he sees me as mom though so that might have something to do with it
we just adopted a week old kitten a few weeks ago right before we adopted him someone adopted his mom and sisters but not him for whatever reason i can see what you mean hes a crazy little fucker and he couldve used a few more weeks with his mom and family
this role model is a homeless lady giving birth in random people s houses i m no expert but i m not sure that s a good cat role model
yeah we adopted a cat off of craigslist that wasn t fully weaned think she was about maybe weeks old there s no damn manners at all in a good way though she thinks she s more human than cat funny deal oh we were trying to adopt her brother but she came up and just kind of butted him out of the way and said no you want me instead and the rest is history hindsight we should have taken both of them but only wanted one cat at the time because we had one already that one passed away a few months after we adopted her we now have three cats adopted two more from the animal shelter
one of my cats well actually were rescues that we are guessing were around weeks old big kittens so unsure but due to their behaviors we think they were on the younger side of that span luckily i had quite a few other cats at the time i foster and rescue so they got the teaching they needed from the older cats shes still really food motivated and will voice her displeasure at me whenever i pet her when shes eating she has never bit or scratched though just very vocal she also doesnt have a full on meow unless she is very unhappy about something its usually this really quiet mew anywho heres the cat tax meet mist the kitten now one year old that stole my heart and made sure she had her and her brother had their forever home
we recently took in momma cat with a single week old kitten this is comforting although we are keeping both
happens with dogs too we have a puppy that was separated from its momma super early now shes grown but has no idea how to burry hide food for later its sad because we give her a treat and cries cause she wants to save it for later but doesn t know how we try teaching her but she doesn t seem to get it she usually walks around the house whimpering til she gives up
i ended up with a feral kitten found at work took my best buddy cat and many drunk nights rolling on the floor just within reach eventually out of the blue he jumped on my lap been by my side ever since still can t pick him up though
that makes sense we got our kitty at weeks old but him and his siblings were abandoned from about weeks after years he‚Äôs learned some manners but he still doesn‚Äôt really have the best lol
i can attest to this my cat was a rescue at about months and we re sure the previous owner got him from his mom to early because he s a complete for lack of a better word idiot but he s my little idiot and i love him lol
i got my cat when he was weeks old and that is so true i had to teach him how to use the litter box it only took me days but i was so proud although the first time he pooped in the litter box he somehow managed to bring some out with him and went on to rub his bum on the carpet he used to suckle my fingers while kneading on me until he was a little over for the past few months he‚Äôs been suckling on my blanket while kneading on my legs
i got my cat when he was weeks old and that is so true i had to teach him how to use the litter box it only took me days but i months
that‚Äôs so true i got my cat when he was weeks old and i had to teach him how to use the litter box it only took me days and i was damn proud although he somehow managed to bring his poop out with him the first time he used the litter box and casually decided to drag his butt on the carpet for minutes
we kept a momma stray and her kitten he is a real asshole but she s wonderful
that‚Äôs so true i got my cat when he was weeks old and i had to teach him how to use the litter box it only took me days and i am damn proud although he somehow managed to bring his poop out with him the first time he used the litter box and casually decided to drag his butt on the carpet for minutes he used to suckle my finger while he kneaded me but now he suckles my blanket while he kneads on my legs lol
ours was weeks he never learned to clean his butt years later we do it for him every other day mommy time is precious
while this is very true a truly feral mom is sometimes not the best role model kittens can have all sorts of weird behaviors when they don‚Äôt have a chance to learn how to cat but at the same time you really don‚Äôt want them to copy mom if she‚Äôs climbing the walls feral even if you heavily socialize them mom can still be a bad influence
can confirm adopted kitten from crazy cat lady she was the runt and only weeks old now shes a spiteful psycotic asshole we still love her though she s a sweet kitty
my sister s professor found an abandoned cat behind her barn and gave him to my sister because she was studying to be a vet tech fortunately my sister couldn t keep him in the dorms so she brought him home during her fall break during which reko decided that i d be his cat mum instead of my sister he didn t know how to do anything but luckily we had a year old cat named chloe we thought he was a female who took reko under his wing and taught him everything now seven years later we have four cats and chloe has taught all of the other cats how to clean themselves and everything
i got my kitten at weeks she s a little weirdo and has attachment issues but i love her all the same
else they end up like libby the bipolar cat who had to be separated at a few weeks
we found our boy in a tree when he was about months old we could never be sure and he never learned not to have his claws out while playing we tried all of the tricks to try and imitate a fellow kitten but failed and he‚Äôs the messiest litter box user never seen a cat so able to fling litter across the room he wasn‚Äôt with his mother long enough to learn cat manners
my wife got a kitten from a pet store few year back long haired snow white they told her she is weeks old soon after getting home she started bloody stools and runny eyes took her to the vet who then told us its a he and only about weeks old all sorts of infestations and severely underweight he really turned out great an absolutely loving darling unfortunately we found him dead one morning apparently kidney failure which we were told is a thing with white cats he was about years old i have not wanted another cat for fear of it not being the joy snowball was
one of my cats was found abandoned at weeks with a respiratory infection so he had no cat contact very early on he doesn t do slow blinks bury his waste and is really dumb when interacting with our other cat hes really loving though all he wants is contact with another animal and hes happy and luckily isnt food aggressive or an overeater somehow
my cat was orphaned just about when her eyes opened she was raised my humans and a yorkshire terrier and grew up to be a complete weirdo
you say that we got a kitten and he grew up with my old big regal homeboy he was clean he was polite and friendly sadly he passed away at the age of charlie however learned absolutely nothing he rolls up covered in dirt doesn‚Äôt clean himself and just plops down and looks at us as if to say ‚Äúwhat bitch ‚Äù and he has no manners little shit love him though
i adopted a yr old stray rescue that was silent he just never learned to meow or anything then i adopted a kitten that was properly raised by its mother this kitten knew how to make noise and taught the stray to make noise now the stray is a loud mouth sunnovabitch who demands tuna treats non stop
can confirm the bottle baby i found and raised is a major asshole
thats my cat is a jerk sometimes makes sense since the mom can‚Äôt teach them how to act
how old is he my half main coons litter got found at a very young age and then a friend of a friend got him and ended up having to get rid of him when he was young so my ex took him at maybe weeks then at about one year old i took him he used to be a very very strange cat not very well adjusted for being indoors and also unfortunately for my ex to have him her mom got his front paws declawed but he‚Äôs an absolute lover now that he knows theres at least two people always there for him me and my wife and he‚Äôs turned into such a mamas boy me and my wife were scared to death of getting a puppy but he‚Äôs actually been better than we thought he‚Äôd ever be he‚Äôs still a little on alert but after half a year with our puppy they actually are cuddling with us at the same time finally was just gonna say your little furry friend might come out well mannered still it took mine the better part of years now where does the damn time go but yeah years to finally feel like he‚Äôs domesticated
this explains why my kitty is so attached to me and acts like cat people me i got her at weeks but saw her at the shelter at weeks which means she must have been separated at weeks the earliest she s extremely attached to me and treats me like a big cat but treats my boyfriend whom she met when she was around year old like our human housemate
i found one who was estimated by the vet to be weeks old when i found him barely hanging onto life he survived and ended up being an awesome cat but he never really learned how to cat properly
both of the cats i ve owned were separated prematurely both were about weeks but i think the second one was closer to weeks polar opposites first guy was mean nasty hyper always hunting second one i ve watched him corner a mouse whap in in the head a bunch of times and the mouse just goes ow wtf stop both definitely needed more time
my cat was found when he was just a few days old in the streets alone his formal owners adopted him and took care of him he grew up alone and never learned to get along with other cats when his owner got married and had more cats my cat became a nightmare a straight up bully and they had to give him for adoption which is where i come each time i tried to introduce him to another cat he get defensive and angry i have a video of another cat trying to get to know him while he hisses and tries to scratch him he is my little bully and i love him so so much
adopted my cat at weeks not sure how long she was away from mom but she never learned to bury her poop either
not always true in my experience one of my parents cats was born in their house grew up with the mother for years before the mother got very ill and had to be put down that cat is the biggest asshole ever refuses to use cat scratchers but loves to use walls instead only interracts with my parents in hopes of them giving her snacks etc
i adopted my two at weeks they are awesome cats years old now but i will say they do have some bizarre mannerisms we joke around that they don‚Äôt know how to ‚Äúcat‚Äù very well and we even call one the catdog as she‚Äôs almost more doglike in a lot of ways no we don‚Äôt own a dog as far as typical cat behaviors they don‚Äôt have they don‚Äôt bury waste they both still knead blankets and one feels the need to incessantly try to groom you if you pet her they are also very codependent on me specifically they‚Äôre fairly social in general albeit a little skittish so with new people they‚Äôll hide for like an hour and then come out and demand attention but for me they are extremely vocal about wanting attention all the time
gt cat role models have you tried getting her jordan p caterson s new book mews of life
we had a kitten from our semi feral barn cat we adopted her while pregnant and promptly got her fixed that had some health issues she came inside early and lived around our dogs and never really was the same to this day she happily walks on a leash loves car rides plays fetch and generally thinks she‚Äôs a dog
we found our cat abandoned at weeks he had mites and stomach worms we nursed him him back to health and my wife held him so much with gloves at first he is our most loving and attached cat he is also the most well behaved
absolutely true i got one of mine at weeks which is naturally ridiculiously early he s years old now and still sometimes doesn t clean his own butt he grew out of a lot of bad habits and other cats in the household have taught him a lot but the butt cleaning is still a thing i love him to bits though
that s what it is manners they need those extra weeks to learn how to cover up their shit in the litter box and clean their own arse weeks is the way to go
the real negative repercussion is the effect it has on the mother cat i read a story on here that after a mother cat gave birth to her litter the litter was immediately adopted by other families and the mother cat spent the rest of her days carrying around a toy kitten in her mouth and meowing
i once dated a woman who fed a stray at my parents‚Äô house within a week that cat moved in with her
happened to my husband s friend a white tom just walked in and decided he lived there rip chardunk the destroyer
that s how we got our boy cat he followed our spayed girl cat home one day and ended up staying he s obnoxious loud too smart for his own good but also the biggest lovebug
ours followed my husband and our toddler home from a walk he even started crossing streets after them so hubby brought him home he played really rough with adults when he was a kitten but has always been gentle with kids he s a great cat except for his propensity to eat rubber things and almost die when they get lodged in his gut we ve paid for way more cat surgeries than we ever thought we would we re softies
i had a cat that did exactly that i had fed her mom while she was pregnant and set up a little nursery on my patio since the mom wouldn t come in about months later mom was still hanging around outside with her babies one was very enamored with what we called people theater she was saxalways watching us and our cats through the sliding glass door one day i went out to feed them and that kitten waltzed right in and refused to leave she taught herself how to use the litter box and just decided that was her place she would walk on the carpet and spread her toes out like she was walking on a super soft cloud soon after mom and the other cats left whiskers stayed and was a wonderfully quirky super smart kitty she opened kitchen doors would look around inside and close them when she was done she passed at only years old about years ago and i still talk about her fondly
my grandparents were so famous with the stray community they ended up with cats in total two which they chose five which chose them
my parents have lived in their house for years two years ago a female tuxedo cat just showed up on their back porch and never left she decided they were her people and that was that she s the sweetest most loving cat to humans but to every other living thing she s a ruthless killing machine
mine just showed up outside the patio door on a rainy autumn night looking inside i opened the door to offer her some shelter she came in dried off and napped on my couch still here five years later
that s what mine did basically i didn t even want a cat but sure was too little too toss out i spent weeks looking for a home for her but then
happened to me too my roommate saw a black stray cat and fed her a half a can of tuna three days later she wiggled through our screen slider and we had a cat about a month later she had a boy and girl kitten about three months later we had to give them up for adoption because the complex reminded us that the no pets clause included cats the kittens got adopted while i was in line
my parents got a cat because it walked into the assembly hall on the first day of school where my mother taught and no one claimed it he d be about now
we do a year ago a stray ginger tabby skin and bone made a home on our porch and was just like i live here now he s since moved from the porch to the couch the bed the wardrobe and everywhere else he pleases and is no longer skin and bone
a stray entered our house and we fed her she got pregnant had male kittens now we have cats
that s how my dad and i got fluffy like years ago i was cooking some meat and the back door was open i looked over and there was a cat sitting there i told me dad and we gave her some meat she only lived with us for a short time before she passed but she was a good spoiled fluffy girl
this is how my mom thinks cats are supposed to be acquired she was disturbed when i went to the shelter to get a cat eventually she decided it was okay because both cats i brought home approached us first in the cat rooms apparently as long as the cat chooses you it s okay people aren t meant to own cats all but one cat she s had over the years was adopted after it moved in essentially she sees a stray she puts out a can of food and leave the garage door open a bit then the next day she puts out a litter box and leaves the door to the house or the cat flap open the stray then makes himself at home she bathes the stray gives another can of catfood and if it keeps coming back after that she has a cat somehow they always come back after the bath at least different cats over the years moved in this way and none of them stayed away after the bath
except for my first cat as an adult all of my family s cats happened that way first cat i remember was a one eyed feral who gave birth in our storage room before we d even seen her on the property the second hung around the house for a week or so before my dad took pity on her and built her a house just in time for her to surprise us with two kittens the third followed me home from a walk one day and the fourth would hang around in the yard staring enviously at my cats until i called for him with the door opened and he ran straight in and settled on the couch all of them were are the best cats ever
it s how i got my first cat walking through a near empty parking lot at after a mid watch on a navy base by my car were cats one took off when it saw me the other hung around and cuddled put the malnourished orange guy in the car and he started eating some old curly fries that dropped to the passenger floorboard set up shop in my barracks closet for him to hide since no pets are allowed but i was moving to an apartment in a week in months he looked like an orange meatball and was content to lounge on the balcony at nights years later while my guy may be gone he gave me many good memories and a cat preference so i now have cats one of them was a kitten when the orange guy was still with me the other are barely over a year old
my parents have a barn all three cats they have currently the one we lost half a year ago were either born in there or spent a good chunk of their time there being fed by them before moving into the house
i think this is very common our cat picked me out outside our gym and my friends cat walked into their backyard and seemed to like it
happened when i was growing up a stray used to pop round to the old house we lived in we moved when i was three and the cat followed us to the new house i guess he ended up adopting us he was still quite feral he loved to sleep in the sun inside and be petted but after a while he would get fed up with you and just hiss a bit spent a lot of his time outside but would always pop back for food we had big stone walls around two sides of the garden and he would often patrol them we were never sure how old he was but we suspect he was around or when he eventually had to be put down based on when he came to us and how long he survived
this is pretty much how the overall domestication of cats happened
happened to me random ginger kitten turned up in my garden and simply wouldn‚Äôt fuck off for months before being officially adopted despite already having cats he now wakes me up each day by sitting on my chest fuck you corkie
happened to my parents before i was born their neighbours moved away and just abandoned their cat by not taking it with them apparently it turned up at my parent s front door came inside and was like hey guys i live here now
my friend already had two cats but one day after giving them food she turns around to see three cats eating out of the bowls after checking with the neighbors none which recognized the new one my friend now has cats
never had a cat until this exact situation she wandered in from the corn field and has been living the life ever since
our cat was the neighbourhood hussy tried her scam on everyone when we moved in we fell for her ‚Äúi‚Äôm a starving stray‚Äù bullshit she had a home across the street and now she spends her nights sleeping in my boyfriend‚Äôs chest hair interestingly her owners did a runner and left her behind so now she is actually ours
well add three to your count lol i have two that i acquired this way and my mom just got chosen last night üòÇ
our family currently in the process of that a pregnant little lady cat being chase by wild stray jungle dogs so we had no choice but to shelter her in the problem is we already got cats in our house that would kill this cat so we had to separate them and figuring what to do with mama cat in progress
when i was about i opened the door to go to school and a cat ran in the house and hasn‚Äôt left now over years later and yes we put up flyers and tried to find owners
nice place you got here be a shame if somebody discovered it
i m pretty sure that s how we as a species got cats in the first place
yeah that s my life and i have to take him to the vet when his battle wounds are too hardcore like half his face missing type shit little fucker just wants cuddles though so worth it
my nan had cats over a period of about years and they were all originally strays
cats self domesticated using pretty much this strategy these people have grain that means mice which means food i ll sleep near them so i can eat all the mice
most recent cat adoption was this it was last winter and right before it got bad cold he would have died he just walked in through my door as i was leaving food out for him he hasn t left since
as a person who is very allergic to cats i hope no cat ever decides to live with me
me all my cats have been rejects from other people one of them was meowing at my front door she was with me for years
sometimes i wonder how many cats have been stolen because someone thinks it s a stray
that‚Äôs how we got our half feral half i won‚Äôt devour your face when you pet me unless i‚Äôm moody cat she showed up pregnant and made instant friends in our yard with my then year old son he was hugging and petting her and she was looking at me like ‚Äúyeah dumbass tell the kid you gotta make me move along‚Äù so long story short the manipulative feral cat turned into cats that i‚Äôm somehow now responsible for but truth be told that momma cat stuck with us and has worked her ass off to keep our little farm vermin free she has definitely made herself invaluable to us she was the cat we didn‚Äôt know we needed
when i was we found a box of abandoned kitters beside a path in the bush we kept one and gave the others away to nice homes he‚Äôs an asshole but a cute asshole
upstate new york brutal winter and there is this howling sound coming somewhere my family and i smoke out on the back deck and this all black cat starts yelling at us howling we were genuinely frightened we realize it‚Äôs degrees so we build one of those stray cat boxes out of a cooler and blankets set some food out the next day we open the door to go outside and he just strolls on in we later found out he was filled to the brim with parasites and desperately malnourished it‚Äôs been years and he hasn‚Äôt left abbadon the black cat he still is very very vocal to this day
this happened to my parents twice right after moving into a new home the feral neighborhood cats who never even lived in my parents just decided to move in they were the only cats my parents ever liked since they‚Äôre dog people haha
unfortunately i also wonder how many missing beloved well looked after cats are stolen by people who think that a cat hanging out at your house means it‚Äôs chosen you and you have the right to keep it
this is why cats are part of so many societies even worshipped by some strong human bonding proclivity
cats aren t actually domesticated their natural behavior allows them to cohabit with humans
that s how i acquired my cat goober now he s the fattest cat on the block and if he think he s been outside too long he ll sit outside the kitchen window and just stare unblinkingly until someone lets him in
that is how my parents got our first cat had kittens in their shed she ended up living with them for years and me for
this is how my family got almost all of our cats last time i was home we got inside cat outside cats and probably couple more who just come to eat i‚Äôm invincible to sneak attack now you‚Äôll never know when they are going to attack vet visit is a fucking mess
you can just throw it out or kill it you know real life is not so cute as reddit comments farming cute karma people smash cats under their feet
i was pregnant with my second son when my now third and final cat meets my so in our backyard while he is out there he tells the kitty politely that it needs to find another home we have two cats and a baby on the way at this point i haven t met her night comes i wake up to a full bladder and after doing my business i decide to step out back to enoy the early hours of an october morning as soon as i open the door luna was there we startled and gasped at each other but once the instant surprise wore off i invited her in for a few minutes well as most cats go she decided to stay i am so happy i did she is snuggled in and i can t believe how happy my older son is to have her around love you luna
one time we were leaving my mom s best friend s house and a cat ran up to the door as we were walking out and was sure she was coming in mom s friend is an animal lover so i figured she must have gotten a new cat and we just hadn t seen it yet she lives on a farm and has a few cats so i opened the door to the main part of the house and in she went well we get a call the next morning from mom s bff saying she has a random cat in her house apparently that wasn t her cat this was years ago that random cats name is lexi and she is the queen of the house now but that stray cat was so sure she was moving in i didn t even question if it was her cat or not
happened to us a cat just walked up to the garden every morning sat on your lap and whenever the door opened decided that was her new home took her to a vet for a check and then had a new roommie
i have a little fucker just like that sleeping on my leg as we speak love her though
happened to a few friends living in france eventually she ended up leaving a few years later cats just do what they feel like doing
my cousin had a stray cat follow him around on his lunch at work for months used to share his lunch with him after a while that cat ended up living his whole life in my cousins family home
that s how i got my cat he walked into my house and layed across my keyboard while i was typing because he wanted affection it took me about seconds to fall in love he is such an awesome smart and loving kitty he changed my life and i followed a career path in the veterinary field because of him
that s how we got all of our cats growing up my parents were awesome
according to the aspca about of them including my tiny asshole she‚Äôs the best and a former under the porch cat
we gained two in this manner winston came to us one february with frost nip on his toes and ears and dinah moves in one december and hid for two months she an eternal skittish kitten and he‚Äôs an alpha type who shamelessly solicits food and belly rubs from all out neighbours in a three block radius
my grandma got her last cat like that as well she d had a lot of cats before but they d all died mostly due to cars and she d decided she couldn t handle losing another cat one day a black and white male cat arrived at her yard looking sad he was in good condition looked like a house cat but he had no collar or anything grandma gave him food he ate and then left this continued for months until winter was around the corner my grandma presumed the cat was abandoned and could not bare the thought of him freezing to death so he let him in he was careful at first very polite probably afraid he d be tossed out if he misbehaved eventually he realised he could stay and relaxed he lived with them for years until finally he got badly sick and had to be put to sleep his name was mussu and he was a very nice cat lt
that would be me momma kitty would come around but i could never touch her one day she climbed in my lap and i realized she was in labor i was still shocked that she had climbed into my lap when the first kitten dropped she purred and let me love over her for hours while she gave birth afterwards she trusted me but never liked to be touched i still have that kitten today she is a bit ornery just like her mother was
haha yep i ve always had dogs but now i have a wild cat too
my cat butters just followed me home one day and hasn‚Äôt left since
that s how i got all of my cats i have they came to my door one by one and i just can t resist
idk about cats but that‚Äôs the way dogs tend to think when going into labour they look for a safe quiet place and usually only let their favourite trusted people near
happened to me heard a meowing at my back door was a feral kitten i opened the door because i was expected my cat and it happily came in deciding it was gonna stay his name is switch because i also bought a nintendo switch that day
that s happened to my mum twice now the cats just adopted her
that would be us years after said cat kept walking past the lounge window pucker whistling like we wouldn t notice
that s how you get a cat if you go get one from a pet store or from a breeder bring it home and it doesn t choose you it ll go find someone else and it ll come back to be fed
that s what happened to my wife and now me she opened her apartment door and in walks this cat who just makes herself at home checked for owners but nothing turns out she was pregnant and was probably looking for shelter she found homes for all of the kittens but one so now we have two cats
i ve had cats adopt me before one cat just wondered in my house and sat down to wait for me to give him food my other cats were all fed on paper plates and he wanted a plate of wet food stayed with us from that day
mine just followed me home one day and i was like okay i guess the next day or so i was like well i have a cat now these days i just feel lucky she picked me because she s sweet and lets me cuddle her and i love her so much
every cat i‚Äôve ever owned just wandered in and decided to live here our current cat finch chose us about years ago and never left üòÄ
happened to my mom grandpa said he hated cats not after that
that s how some of our cats came to be they just shown up and were like this is home now
happened to my best friend his girlfriend was getting storm supplies from her car and this little white cat waltzed right in she ended up knocking on my door with a serious what do i do face i lived across the street and i gave her some starter supplies for the cat til my friend could come home we were expecting a tornado no way a cat that friendly was getting booted back outside in that weather
this is how we got our cat‚Äôs frank and harry they just walked right in
the kitten from my story is now about months he s got my two senior cats to deal with but he s so much more agile than them he gets to just be the little demon of our house lol we have plans to get a dog in the future and my hope is that the kitten will become besties with the dog
people have this weird idea that all animal behavior is controlled by instinct a lot of animal behavior is actually learned animals have minds with memories and their own versions of thoughts just because their minds aren‚Äôt human doesn‚Äôt mean they aren‚Äôt there or don‚Äôt have value
my now year old cat has small issues like that too she was found all alone apparently separated from her mother around weeks the worst is that she doesn t bury her poops she also has such a weird meow our older cat taught her some things i guess but not enough
hmm my kitty was wks and he s the sweetest smartest little sweet boy he was already litter box trained but sort of jokingly i decided to toilet train him and he picked right up on it he can be a bit of a moody cat though which i sum up to him being so spoiled if he s real sleepy he gets quite cranky and you just have to leave him alone so he can go nap if you bother him too much before naptime he ll lay his ears back amp growl however he really is my sweet baby boy he cuddles up against my side with his head on my shoulder i wrap both arms around him tight amp rest my head atop his head we ll sleep like that for hours they all have their own little personalities
i took in a litter of week old kittens from the spca to foster they needed to be syringe fed every four hours we had to teach them how to bury their poop how to clean themselves how to not just wade into their plate of food in an attempt to absorb it via osmosis one of the little guys just tugged at my heartstrings and so i ended up adopting him he still suckles and kneads on the blanket that we put in their kitten bed little guy misses his momma
hmm maybe that s why my cat didn t bury her poop or she s just lazy idk
my cat is the same way she has a lot of behaviors issues and the shelter only told us she was an owner surrender we have another adopted cat but we know literally nothing about her and she doesn t have any maternal instinct to teach the other one how to act right
my current cat was abandoned by her stray mom at around week old during a really bad thunderstorm and was the exact same way my older cat taught her how to use the litter box but she s now and still a heathen she has serious attachment issues and nurses on my blankets every time i lay down and cries if i go into the other room without her
we adopted a month old cat who had probably been abandoned too young she didn t know how to clean herself no manners etc our other kitten taught her and now she s the most perfectly mannered kitty unless you have food then she will smack you until you hand it over
i have a cat like this we found him at the lake and he was just a few weeks old he still doesn t cover his poop years later
i love my artemis but she sucks my fuckin ear a few times a week i got them at twelve weeks but they didn t have a momma not sure what the story was her and her sister are the light of my life though
question does your suckling cat have a flabby piece that hangs down from her belly my cat suckled a lot because he was separated from mom too early and he has what we affectionately call a nipple bag because of it
my cat was maybe weeks when we took her in she was fairly socialized and knew how to cat but she sucks on anything nubbly
my cat still doesn t bury her poop she was adopted out to a neglectful family when she was much too little a cat foster parent was going around and picking up cats to be spayed then dropped off for free and noticed this adorable friendly little tortie rolling around looking for belly rubs she was obviously neglected collar too tight matted fur emaciated no food in sight but this cat was so friendly even though no one cares for it so the foster lady took her and never came back the owners never called wondering where their cat was so ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è now i have an awesome stolen cat in a loving home who just doesn t bury her own poop but the most egregious part of the whole story is that she was previously named lafawnduh spelled that way zoey suits her a lot better
i fostered week old kittens that had been dumped in a box i had an adolescent cat at the time that babied them and taught them things but one of them had a lot of litter box problems the people who adopted him sent him back because they didn t want to deal the one i fail fostered still pees somewhere random once in a while and she never trusted anyone other than me for at least years now she trusts the whole family but never visitors so much must be learned in the first few weeks
my kitten was acquired at weeks it‚Äôs been a thing progress has been made he loves pets he hates pets i didn‚Äôt really sleep for three weeks
got my one cat at weeks guess they had to get rid of them wherever she clung to me so where chose me had to rub her butt to teach her to poop and fed her formula have another female cat at the time who is a diva and couldn t be bothered so she never really learned cat mannerisms or how to socialize moved in a few years ago with my now wife her cat does not get along with my younger cat i just think it s because she hides and is very solitary and when she is around his curiosity gets the best before my older girl had no interest in her now she has this big cat intently interested and that likes to play i wish i could make her less scared
my cat i got is about now her mother got knocked up the second she was able so maybe year if that and just bailed on the kittens i lived on a farm at the time and it was adopted and brought back twice by children of the daughter way too early i guess the parents of the kids said no to a cat anywho it was winter and there was no heat in the house i had recently moved out and i remember visiting and seeing all the kittens in a pile and she was all alone across the room must of been about degrees inside i was poor as fuck and didn t even have furniture at my apartment not even a mattress but i was like nope fuck it you re coming with me now i have a cat that s pretty much retarded that follows me around she doesn t ever meow can t cover her litter and has no clue about hunting i have to clean her once a week she runs away and hides behind me if there s anything not normal so mice birds storms people anything shes a worthless cat super polite tho won t jump on counters or break shit she will just come up to me and sit and look at me to ask for things if i don t notice her she may trill after an hour to get my attention and i have to follow her around the house to see what she needs shes my shit head and i love her
is weeks the norm for cats i m a dog person so i m only familiar with them and people usually send them home at weeks granted a lot of good breeders are moving towards weeks
that‚Äôs so true i got my cat when he was weeks old and i had to teach him how to use the litter box it only took me days and i am damn proud although he somehow managed to bring his poop out with him the first time he used the litter box and casually decided to drag his butt on the carpet for minutes he used to suckle my finger while he kneaded me but now he suckles my blanket while he kneads on my legs lol
the same thing happened to me my sister s professor found an abandoned cat behind her barn and gave him to my sister because she was studying to be a vet tech fortunately my sister couldn t keep him in the dorms so she brought him home during her fall break during which reko decided that i d be his cat mum instead of my sister he didn t know how to do anything but luckily we had a year old cat named chloe we thought he was a female who took reko under his wing and taught him everything now seven years later we have four cats and chloe has taught all of the other cats how to clean themselves and everything
my sister s professor found an abandoned cat behind her barn and gave him to my sister because she was studying to be a vet tech fortunately my sister couldn t keep him in the dorms so she brought him home during her fall break during which reko decided that i d be his cat mum instead of my sister he didn t know how to do anything but luckily we had a year old cat named chloe we thought he was a female who took reko under his wing and taught him everything now seven years later we have four cats and chloe has taught all of the other cats how to clean themselves and everything
yea we made a similar mistake of getting a kitten at weeks she suckles lots although its starting to slow down now at about year old and is one of the strangest cats ive seen and clumsiest haha
that s cool never realized animals didn t know how to behave i guess growing up without any pets i never thought about it thanks
i never even thought of that i wonder if that s why my cat is such an awkward dumbass who can t bury his shit
yeah we did that we got out little boy cat very young and he had no concept of playing too rough his claws were like daggers once we got an older little girl she taught him manners very quickly he is now much more of a gentleman
we got our kitten at weeks she was still with mum when we got her and she loves to suckle a blanket only when she‚Äôs cold though
smh you got a cat and don t know how to properly teach it clearly you got to be the alpha cat for atleast a couple months you lick your and your cat s body and never shower in that time period poop outside and then bury it yourself and just basically sleep a lot and sometimes be a jerk that way you can be the role cat model for your lil kitty
the kitten we kept from my cat s litter did those things too she just recently started burying her poo right at nearly she s good with all the other cat stuff though needy af
i did the same thing i adopted a five week old kitten and my older cat really took her under his wing he showed her how to climb use the litter box and groom we called her ‚Äúgeneral meow‚Äôs pet cat‚Äù for the longest time
my kitty was adopted from a shelter as a baby she was only about nine weeks old but they had already weaned and spayed her it made me a little uneasy but i understood the need to move animals through as quickly as possible and that kitty chose me i think she was separated from her mother far too early though she still attempted to suckle and couldn‚Äôt clean herself she‚Äôs six now and she still can‚Äôt groom herself properly she tends to clean her front legs and one patch on her belly only enough that she licks bald patches and i have to clean the rest of her with pet wipes when she gets dirty i love her to bits though and wouldn‚Äôt trade her for the world
most of my cats suckle every so often one does every time he goes to sleep he loves fleece material best for suckling i bought him a new bed covered in fleece material and usually he‚Äôs afraid of anything new but as soon as he saw what it was covered in he jumped right on and was purring so loudly as he suckled and fell asleep still with the fleece in his mouth it was so cute
my family had cats at once for a while its not bad just get more than one litter box and change them regularly
i have seven cats and honestly it‚Äôs not that bad just make sure you have a couple of litter boxes around the house for them to pee in if it‚Äôs too cold outside also when you have that many cats they behave very much like a lion pride with a top cat and a bottom cat so make sure you lay out dishes and watch that they all eat because sometimes the ‚Äòbottom‚Äô cat loses out on food
how do the kittens social skills with human differ from their mothers can you tell any obvious difference between them and a non feral mother cat
mother cats experience major grief after being separated from their kittens if you get rid of any i suggest making sure they go to a very good home
keep them for weeks enjoy every minute be exhausted then adopt them to good homes at a nominal price to ensure they have good homes get mama spayed and enjoy your lives together
we had cats when i was growing up it can get a bit soap opera at times two of them the siamese and the balinese variant were enemies the other four were balinese you‚Äôd have thought that the shorthairs would‚Äôve stuck together but no our cats loved cardboard boxes as beds i believe there were four boxes and they would sleep together in pairs make sure you have a good number of litter trays and it‚Äôll be fine littermates will be very close to each other
aww she amp the babies look pretty content thanks for being kind to little creatures
why dont you just let her and the cats be free if she wants to be outside why aren t you letting her outside
i ve dealt with a feral mom before and this is not how she acted she wouldn t let us anywhere near her and would repeatedly false charge us i along with a charity organization eventually managed to deprogram her and she turned friendly it was sometime really scary trying to socialize her kittens but she never broke any skin
does she have a place to hide and take the kittens like a box with a hole in it sounds like she s trying to take the kittens somewhere she feels is more secure also playing music softly in the room can get her used to people talking and show her it s not scary
check out youngestoldcatlady and kittenxlady on instagram for resources solidarity on caring for young kittens
watch the kittens we had a litter once where the kittens all ended being feral assholes literally hissing from the time they were about a week old until we got rid of them almost weeks later
let her out now she knows how to take care of the babies out there keep leaving food out for them so they ll come back and when it s time take them to a trap neuter release service
there is a youtube channel i came across called flatbush cats they had a recent video about looking after a feral mom cat and her kittens maybe look it up and even contact them for advice the one you have sounds less feral but could be helpful
gt windo any chance she has other kittens out there would she be more comfortable being in a shed or somewhere else contained but a bit more rustic
the easiest way to fix that is to put a threshold down in that doorway
how do you know it s not someone s pet and she s trying to take them home
she probably has kittens somewhere else before going there let her out
yea blanketing the windows and making a couple hides spots even if their in a room to all their own they ll want something small and cozy to hide in when my cat had kittens we let her have them in the spare room blanketed windows and i made two box with blankets shes laid on before so had her scent idk if you have anything with this cats scent though so make do and put one box in a corner and the other in the spare room closet with that door slightly ajar so she had a few options to hunker down with them for privacy also took a box and set it on its side and put some litter in there so when she had to go she had something and the kittens would most likley get a good view to see and learn maybe also draping a blanket over the cozy hiding box like a make shift curtain will help ease and make her more comfortable too
that‚Äôs great which just makes her a stray feral means wild almost any cat that makes it to adulthood without any human contact will be feral truly feral cats are completely untouchable and can rarely be socialized it‚Äôs great she came to you because her babies have a much better chance at life now thanks for being a good human and taking her in
get one of those big rubbermaid storage bins and cut a cat sized hole in one end put a clean blanket inside give mom a shelter
i adopted a stray who‚Äôd been living on the streets for a while but would let me pet him and was not scared of me as were the true freaks he was hanging around with i‚Äôm certain he was domesticated at some point but lived on the street long enough to where he went semi wild when i captured him to get him some medical treatment involving his needing to stay in my apartment overnight he also freaked out and kept trying to escape tuna packed in water works wonders sounds like the cat knew enough about humans to know to go to you for help i‚Äôm sure a true stray would have hid things like an indoor fan simulating the moving air of the outside world a radio softly going with classical music and a pet heating pad might want to help her stay indoors good on you for being so good to this cat
get her some cardboard boxes from costco when we got our kittens they were terrified of us and i made them a box fort they hid there for a while while they got use to us i made sure the box fort had chambers that we couldn‚Äôt directly see into but weren‚Äôt so deep that we couldn‚Äôt reach into if absolutely necessary strongly recommend something similar stick some blankets in it and boom perfect den
i had a stray cat come and give birth in front of me too and she also wanted tf out but like others said we gave her a couple of boxes and created some spaces that would look like hiding spots we kept her fed and watered and litter scooped and she ended up being so sweet with some time she‚Äôs an inside cat now doesn‚Äôt even try to go outside she‚Äôs over that life lol
awww must be confusing for her kudos for taking appropriate measures calm down mama kat
might consider putting stripes of painter s tape on the windows to make an obvious barrier the tape should come off cleanly later
cats like to move their nests for safety try moving the nest box around so she feels more secure x
that s so adorable i love it how old is the video do you know if they ever went back a year later for an update
i thought the mechanism that cats use to purr isn t fully understood and this squirrel picks it up naturally heh wow since their anatomies differ i would guess the squirrel does something approximating a purr but it sure sounds similar can a cat purring expert chime in and explain purring please
the squirrel was just going through a phase he‚Äôs a dog now
boss i m telling you we have to run the kennedy assassination piece i ve been working on i ve blown the whole thing open this is going to put me on the map listen walt i know you put a lot of work into that piece but we are pulling you from that case we ve got something hot out of mississippi we need you to get down there asap
i just heard a purring squirrel that s not a sentence i ever thought could possibly exist but there it is
omg tails taking animals into loving shelters is the cutest more clever name
no problem just throw one in an envelope with some foam peanuts
i‚Äôm in cleveland ohio meet in the middle i can be the kitten drop location
i ll take one i m located in prudhoe bay i ll meet you in prudhoe bay
wait where in indiana i‚Äôm in indy and looking for a cat pm me
i have a friend in indiana i haven‚Äôt spoken to him in a few years and have no idea if he wants a cat though i hope you find them the best possible homes
so like indiana close to ohio i d be down to grab a kitten
i‚Äôm in indiana and would definitely be interested in adopting one
dang if anyone has any florida kittens i would make the trek
not to freak you out but be careful for people looking for free kittens to feed to their snakes or use as bait charge a minimum rehoming fee if you decide to adopt out the kittens
be careful with people looking for free kittens to feed their snakes or use as dog bait charge a minimum rehoming fee to help prevent this if someone can‚Äôt afford a adoption fee they probably can‚Äôt afford to feed a cat for life either good luck finding them homes
i find this hilarious because i live in the middle of alaska and it takes us hours to drive to the next biggest city and it is no big deal road trip weekend
i live in indy and took a charter bus to nyc that took like hours but maybe it just took a bad route or something
im in indiana and had kittens march th i have left for now
indianapolis by chance i know a family that wants a kitten or two
hmmm northern indiana i might be able to take one of your hands
my mom has one cat and her dog has picked up cat mannerisms i can only imagine with
had one dog and three cats the dog needed more socializing on a regular basis so we got a puppy from a local rescue that puppy is now a seventy pound cat who chases bugs and laser pointers
haha yup we had an old year tabby when we got our little pom jack mix she grooms herself like a cat and if she is on her back she goes full cat mode expecting belly scratches while also fighting to keep you away from her if you stop the scratches she will whine and then get next to you and try to wedge herself under your arm needless to say i would not have her any other way she is a crazy dog but she is my lovable crazy dog
or your cat acts more like a dog my crazy boy spent the first year of life with big dogs now he climbs in the windowsill and barks away the chihuahua next door honestly hilarious to watch lol
i got a puppy as a kid and my sister already had a cat dang cat raised my dog looked out window one day and my then full grown dog was lying on warm hood of my mom s brand new ford thunderbird just like a cat he did a number on the paint
as a kid i got a pup and my sister s cat taught him all later as a full grown dog i found him lying on the warm hood of my mom s new car sunning himself like a cat ruined the paint dad was not happy
i had a fox terrier who lived with our two cats she was at the bottom of the totem pole of power and both cats would boss her around she was very happy when we got a new kitten and she finally got to be the boss acted like a cat the entire time
i have dogs and cat that basically is now a small jerkish dog that use a litter box instead of going outside
i had a dog who grew up with cats and a th very doglike cat the dog took after the cats so i have a pound cat regular cats and a pound dog
very true it s kinda like a boy growing up with sisters he isn t going to turn gay but will definitely be let s say more balanced in some respects
have a dog socialized to cats he doesn‚Äôt know how to dog ignores dogs hides from dogs but acts like cats are buds he and his best friend groom each other and snuggle dog weighs pounds cat weighs it‚Äôs completely silly
yup that s my cat dog she does dog stuff but with a catlike manner
i don t even have a cat and my dog acts like one his worst offense is literally licking his paw and cleaning his face it s a little unreal his best is the fact that his training aid is a spritz bottle of water don t even need to spritz him when he starts acting up i just point at it and he behaves
had dogs and one young feral junkyard kitten he suckled on a border collie until the day the collie died years old total dickhead of a cat at first and he would catch things like bats and rabbits and even a small owl once but he ended up being the sweetest and most loyal feline warrior
goes both ways my little cat boy was separated from his mother too early grew up in a household with a dog and now he plays fetch and doesn t know how to miauw lt
my sister got a husky pup and a kitten around the same time and now our husky sits like a cat dogs definitely mimic their role models
can confirm my dog jumps on my dressers and tables and she lives with many feline friends
same here love my little girl she had no problem being picked up and thrown around she loves people our only problem is because of me i played with her using my hands when she was very young so she ll still play with biting but she ll never break skin with her teeth she s also learned to keep her claws retracted on her hind legs when she gets ya
he never even tried to die lol that s amazing though but you can t just say that and not give us some pics
i have two rescues who turn cat haters into cat people cats are far more sensitive to their upbringing than dogs are handle them often give them lots of love and attention and socialize them with ‚Äústrangers‚Äù while they‚Äôre young and they will not act like hellspawn
i believe it is the law of the land in these parts that you provide us with a photo of that cat
our cat odin was the runt of the litter born with feline herpes virus that caused one of his eyes to basically be sealed up before it was developed so he only has one working eye and one black orb he was so sickly but once he recovered he started growing exponentially so now we have a pound gentle giant who s the biggest baby i ve ever seen i think his dad was a maine coon but i can t be sure he s the closest thing i ve ever had to a golden retriever just a big goofy love bug
and i do not like pets well you have a pirate not a pet
you got a fighter sometimes they are just so right for you
that story made me tear up what a rough start in life im glad you love him i m sure he loves you too
this is amazing thank you for loving him and giving him a good home he had such a painful and rough start to life
this was awesome you sound like great humans to take responsibility and love him what‚Äôs his name
i mean if you got basically put into critical condition by a speeding car got your face rearranged woke up to having your eyeball hanging out of the socket and having to live with it for a bit a hole in your mouth and your teeth knocked out only to survive have some more surgeries and go on to make a full recovery would you have any fears
i think that even though they don t like the process they feel better after my cat not long ago came home smelling like skunk did a soap peroxide soak bath which he howled through but after he was done he snuggled up on my lap which isn t something he usually does with me he s my hubbys suck
i have had and still have adopted foster cats that are all super sweet affectionate lay on your chest rub nose on your face tolerate our year old carrying the around like luggage cats for over years now and still can‚Äôt imagine trying to give them a real bath the two boys let me give them summer haircuts to preempt dreads and incredible shedding but i sincerely don‚Äôt know what would happen with a bath god bless your mother
those don t really sound like feral cats though maybe they were cats that used to be pets and were abandoned we once had to rehabilitate some feral kittens and get them ready for adoption and i can t imagine anyone in their right mind deciding to try and wash a feral cat before it was completely comfortable with you in my experience that s a process of weeks if not months
maybe the ice cream man would have better luck keeping his prey if he bathed those ragamuffins
if i tried that around here i d end up with a house full of freshly adopted raccoons
i think things swing heavily in your mom s favor when she sets food out ü§£ every woman in my family sets out food for random cats also do lots of women do this
putting out a can of food as a means of luring seems like it would go against her they must choose you rule imo
apparently as long as the cat chooses you it s okay people aren t meant to own cats yes cats don t have owners they have staff
gt eventually she decided it was okay because both cats i brought home approached us first in the cat rooms that s how my parents decide which cat of the litter goes home with them
your mom is a smart woman humans own dog but cats own humans
my auntie does that too but she lives in a small town in the countryside where there‚Äôs plenty of strays
i‚Äôm with your mother on this the cat picks you it‚Äôs like ‚Äúi‚Äôm going to give you the honour to love me human ‚Äù and we do
that what i thought too i can do my dogs do command with only gestures the other hand can be giving signals it s a nice trick but even the lay down is giving the hint to lay down
how come all these videos have the same chord progression from ‚Äúwildflowers‚Äù
i want to see the left hand too my dogs all respond better to hand signals than verbals
dog trick video faker than some flower in a powder bag
dogs can be taught hand commands and it s very easy my dog actually prefers hand commands to vocal not a problem with hearing i ve checked he just prefers hand commands
it could be other ways to command a dog to used to get my dog to drop his ball by stepping backwards one step
dog doesn t even turn its head to look at pictures i don t believe it one second either
now let‚Äôs hear the alternate ending when this good boi gets the treats he deserves
you can clearly see on the last one there is a hand gesture god dam age of social media lies
this could still be accomplished without verbal commands we only see one of the hands of the person holding the cellphone they could be using the other to issue nonverbal commands considering the way they moved their hand downward during the demonstration of show the dog the dog laying down and the dog lays down i strongly suspect the dog is being issued nonverbal commands and that is what the dog is responding to or a second person could be standing nearby issuing nonverbal commands a second person is probably involved anyway because of the camera i mean it s impressive to me that a dog listens to any instruction but it s silly to jump to the conclusion it s because of the image
you‚Äôll hear a man behind her telling the dog commands lol
they could even just be using their other hand for commands off camera
this is maya polar bear on instagram i saw this video with that loud music and immediately knew it was fake
yeah i‚Äôm pretty sure dogs are unable to recognize images on a phone screen very well especially from that distance
my friend s father did the same thing with commands written in text on huge cardboard signs placed on an easel the trick was the placement of the hand on the sign every corners and sides meant a different command he was really great with dogs
knew what was going on before i went to the comments glad people didn‚Äôt let this one slide
this is leigh on sea as far as i can see from the background
after a google map search gonna be lazy and just say porthleven i don t know tbh
whenever someone describes food as ‚Äúdivine‚Äù i can‚Äôt help but imagine some pound lady saying it while rolling her eyes back and doing jazz fingers
i wouldn‚Äôt call it cute romanian dogs are known to be naturally aggressive and thus more likely to spread rabies you can see the anger in its eyes original poster also seems to be feeding the dog far too much you see the chubby cheeks that‚Äôs a sign of little exercise in dogs i hate when people have dogs but don‚Äôt know how to look after them the best thing for this dog would be to go back to romania in my humble opinion
the paper underneath the chips says the peterboat in leigh on sea
yes mate you can just tell those chips are bobby dazzlers
looks like the pub garden of the peterboat in leigh on sea
you said doggo and devine and referred to fries as chips i would have punched you in the face
maybe complete bullshit but i m sure i remember seeing somewhere someone did a study on sheep and discovered they essentially have different dialects languages depending on where they live maybe dogs have the same i think it was on qi i saw that but i wouldn t bet on it
if you teach them as a pup no but usually a in the case of stray dogs adopted from abroad in uk you will get in most cases a dog behavioural because trust me this dog had a hard live in the romanian shelters or streets and most of them understand only two cues for hunger and abuse my dog reacts to my commands in three languages romanian english and russian because that s how i decide to train him
there is a classic far side cartoon where human is blathering to the dog and the dog only hears blah blah blah bob blah blah blah bob
funny story i knew a dog who was adopted at about or it seemed like it was well trained and waiting for orders but it didn t seem to know what you were saying they had a friend come over who was east european or something like that and the dog really seemed to like him once he started speaking in his native tongue they realized the dog was welled trained just not in english how a east european dog with extensive training happened to be in america they never found out
pretty sure dogs don‚Äôt know complicated language like we do that‚Äôs a big reason we‚Äôve become the biggest species on earth they obviously have some communication maybe that differs for some dogs from other places but idk not an expert though
i know that russian dogs go gav gav instead of woof woof
our mutt is bilingual english amp japanese he ignores us in both languages
my bc aussie and german anatolian speak absolutely different languages until dinner then they are the quintessential definition of unity
i speak to my girlfriend s italian dogs in english sometimes they always get this confused look on their face lol
indonesian dogs say guk guk however cats say meong that probably sounds quite similar everywhere which confirms that cats rule the world
this is actually the case with orcas never heard of it with dogs though i have heard that babies cry with different accents french babies sound weird
yes they take on sounds from the owners of their regions even within one country dogs can have accents to take on your question i do know dogs have sound for stranger here which leads to other dogs within the area to bark as well stranger danger bark to let them know i am here hahaha amp x b as stated from the below comments different countries have different sounds for dogs
i like to imagine dogs speaking english with a ukrainian accent but haven t quite mastered the language its really hilarious i am dog is good boy and demands pets do you have treats you will give them
well considering our dogs s barks in romanian are ham maybe just a little
actually in the great dogehelm of halandor hot from a bloody and sad war united the tribes of the world and agreed upon a standardized language a dog from russia can understand a dog from america though of course there are slight dialectical differences which the doge had forseen and accounted for
there definitely is same used to be true of cats until they adopted espurranto
they did a study on cows that found that herds from different parts of the country had different regional accents so to speak so maybe it s the same with dogs but like a really thick foreign accent
whenever i imagine extra thicc people i imagine them being depressed and thinking to themselves i m useless but at least this is all i can do huhuhu
i picture hedonism bot from futurama so not far off the mark
that s perfectly ruined my option on the word divine but it was somehow ruined so much that it was better
it s amazing how you can place that image in my head from another side of the planet
old leigh is brilliant i thought it looked familiar i‚Äôm from southend but love a good trip down there for a pint and pub grub
wow i was so sure it wasn t anywhere near me what do i know down the road in southend
i ve seen old leigh pop up about three or four times over the past week on here spooky
gotta love all the essex fam here stay reem all you babez xox ‚ù§Ô∏è
i see people like this and it makes me so glad that there are people like her in this world i m a broken garbage human i could never be this kind or selfless but i m happy to know others can be and that there are still good people like her around
aw god bless her her reward will be in heaven no seriously she probably ain t making a living wage here on earth so she better get some kick ass perks in heaven
that is the censored version of my thought that was kind as fuck
very much so i really wish more people had this kind of attitude towards those that may need help he s a human and that is all that should matter
this is very kind but shouldn t be their responsibility why does this guy not have a care giver provided by the state if he can t feed himself
it‚Äôs nice to see the younger generations feel compasi√≥n like this it gives hope to our uncertain future
kindness is the attribute that i look for in a person if two people are kind to each other a relationship can overcome the imperfections inherent in humanity
i agree but why was it necessary shouldn‚Äôt a person with a disability of this level have a carer with him
agreed heartwarming to see one human treat another human as exactly that another human
other type of story my colleague and i ran across a disabled person in a wheelchair on our lunch break he asked us to help him push his wheelchair to the next bus stop we were quite caught off guard and not sure what to do he insisted so my colleague helped and i tagged along it was ‚Äûjust around the corner‚Äú which turned out not to be around the corner at all anyway she finally said she was sorry but not able to help any further he then suddenly wheeled into the middle of a road without a crossing when we said he can‚Äòt cross there as he won‚Äòt be able to get up the curb the other side and we wouldn‚Äòt even be able to lift him he does it anyway one side of the road stops as they see him the other just keeps going and now he‚Äòs stuck in the middle of a super busy dangerous road i run out stop the cars and then help him cross and luckily manage to lift him over the curb he continues on to the bus and away we feel very uncomfortable with the situation you obviously want to help but a disabled man unable to wheel himself probably shouldn‚Äòt be going through the city by himself he definitely wasn‚Äòt in a good enough state to be on his own without a carer next day my colleague finds out there was a care home nearby and what she‚Äòd done was basically help him escape she only meant well and i only tried to stop him from getting run over by cars as he refused to give up on his quest to the bus station but in hindsight we both just aren‚Äôt sure if it had been better if nobody had helped him as maybe he wasn‚Äòt even allowed to leave there
omg we need to see if this in the world this awesome
last time this was posted someone clarified that this was her brother
moments like this really give me hope i say with tears in my eyes
gt good job parents to the mom for raising her kids right
tbh i would think of a lot of people who would rather do this than their actual job
every time i see this i feel like their expressions are so flat it reads as this is just what you re supposed to do
i don t like that the assumption on reddit every time a young man or woman does something kind that it was the parents raising them right really smacks the face of people who had awful parents and try their hardest to be good people regardless be thankful to the person that they are kind and stop there
although i get the sentiment i m not sure why parents get credit for actions they aren t directly involved in maybe the girl in question has the biggest scumbags of parents and she decided to be better
man just fuck off reddit you say the same shit over and over and no one can tell if you re brainwashed by the collective or want karma or both
i don‚Äôt want to criticize but people like her aren‚Äôt always the product of good parenting she gets all the credit in my book i get your intent and it was good but i was very impressed with her compassion
inb someone finds the backstory and writes about how abusive her parents were but yes its a touching video
let s not give nurture all the credit here a person this kind is often kind by nature alone
let s not give the parents all the credit i know plenty of kind people with shite parents
ehh definitely not always on the parents i truly think most humans have the innate willingness to help especially if they don t feel like other people are around and available if you feel like in a situation its either you help this person eat or they can t eat then more often than not you just help the person eat my anecdotal evidence being that while growing up me and my dad were never close to the extent of me moving about hours away not purely because of him but he was one of reasons my dad had a stroke about years ago and the day it happened i quit my job and moved back home been his full time caregiver ever since to me human to human nature has always proven itself to be more kind than not its when people are behind things like the internet or have a way to disassociate themselves with other humans that may come to a more vile outcome
i mean it s probably the manager who asked them made a deal with said person with the disability to do this
oof for all we know her parents could have been absolute despicable human beings
wait so for this wonderful person s act of kindness you re giving credit to the parents
considering their global history they are likely smarter than hoomans
they are the best small animal pet you can get they re cheap to buy feed and house super smart and very affectionate their short lifespan can even have some advantages for parents and people who are unable to make the long term commitment of a dog or cat
i have both of my babies cremated in cute boxes in the room it was so hard when i had to put them down but one lived years and the other so they had fairly long lifes
their life span is like one year not what you can call great pets
i have a pair of rats and i can t seem to properly socialize them i feel awful because all they do is sit in their cage
i like them too but they poop non stop that‚Äôs the thing that drives me nuts
i trained animals to perform in an educational show at a zoo for a while and it was an absolute pleasure to work with the rats my girl had to come out from beneath a fence when released run across an open stage and climb a rope up through a tire the open stage part in particular is the opposite of what any small animal wants to do but she was brilliant one of my co workers trained a group to play basketball at a local science museum they‚Äôre bright social little creatures and cute to boot
do they poop everywhere or is it possible to potty train them
i agree great pets i used to have one that loved sitting on my shoulder would come to you on command and wouldn t piss shit anywhere but her cage i ve had rats on separate occasions times now the problem really is their lifespan and it s pretty heartbreaking only getting a few years with them
what should i expect for people s reaction to having a pet rat in the dating scene is it something you keep hush until you think they d be cool with it
can you train them to poop in a certain spot i d love to have a pet rat that just roams my home
ive wanted a rat since childhood but now i live somewhere they‚Äôre illegal sad cuz they‚Äôre smart and lovely
i ve only know conrad for a day and a half but if anything were to happen to him i d kill everyone in this room and then myself
i would kill rattlesnakes moccasins and elderly and slow honey badgers with my bare hands for conrad i d cut off my right pinky toe with bolt cutters and never walk quite right again not that it would do conrad any good but just to seem edgy and hyperbolic
i want to take care of conrad until the world ends and make sure he never suffers
i can imagine craig from p amp r saying this as he was meeting someone for the first time
my name is conrad and this comment section is wonderful
it would be more noble to die for conrad than anything else
i think it looks like the taco bell logo make a run for the border conrad
or a double sided dick two different kinda of people eh
i see a kitty sitting up with it s back facing me amp completely ignoring me as i call here kitty kitty or whatever it s name would be a million times along with making noises amp doing all sort of antics to try to get it s attention i think this is a game cats secretly play to see just how long we ll keep that up before we give up or to see what silly things we ll do so they ll acknowledge us they win if we finally give up amp leave them alone but we win when it gets on their nerves so bad that they leave the room or finally acknowledge or come to us just to shut us up
and never forget no matter how much he cries no matter how much he begs never feed him after midnight
they also have very delicate constitutions and you need to find a vet who knows how to care for them remember to provide them with something to wear their teeth down on like mice and birds theirs keep growing and can get overly long for anyone interested in owning a bunny i highly recommend reading up on the different breed temperaments and their care needs before committing
that doesn t sound like hard work to be honest it just sounds like owning a pet
also remember to name him george and to hug him and pet him and squeeze him
we had a rabbit as a kid we felt bad keeping it in the cage so we let it run around the house problem is it shit and pissed everywhere and chewed through just about every wire we owned
every day well that s a no from me never ever imagined that they would need food or care
isn‚Äôt that kind of exactly how every pet is though like ‚Äúremember to feed it‚Äù kind of goes without saying
holy mother of crap is what i have to say about this bunbun
and it‚Äôs soo gentle with the kid i really want one now haha
flemish giants my buddy used to have one that was bigger than him until he was or so
or you took time out of your shift to help that guy so it s coming out of your paycheck
fuck automation and fuck people who use the automatic order machines on principle i always ignore them and i will wait in line for minutes even if it means that i have to wait longer for my food every time you make an order through the machine you give this store one more reason to fire its cashiers
tbf it will be a lot softer than that the turnover rate is high enough in the food industry that they just won t hire a new person rather than fire someone automation will not and should not stop but society has to handle it well i believe a post scarcity economy is possible and automation is key also from a manager point of view this looks like a potential lawsuit i could be wrong but special needs assistance seems like it could require a certification
yeah it s sad my step dad has als he won t go out to eat cause people just stare at him struggle
i work in a call center not exactly the same but whenever higher ups start questioning weather we could save money by not encouraging customers to call us or by being less friendly so they talk less i make sure to remind them that it s availability and convenience that keeps the customer here and brings in new customers and i do feel there are too few voices bringing this up in big corporations so once in a while some stupid ceo somewhere pushes customer to rely on numbers on their pc screen only and guess what wins then quality or price
this is not a decision that is made at the manager level it‚Äôs one made at the franchisee or corporate level the managers are there struggling alongside their team members
tell that stupid shit to chick fil a apparently they are removing all electronic drive throughs and are opting in to having their tween workers take orders debit payments in person right there it was awkward and not at all what i look for in the drive through experience
yup these are moments of humanity despite capitalism not because of it
i ve worked in some food places before and managers liked stuff like this and would encourage other employees to help as it helps to foster a positive image of the company not saying they ll get a raise but maybe a gift card or extra paid day off or something
those ordering systems are turning faithful clientele away an older gentleman at mcdonalds couldn t figure out how to work the machine and was about to leave after getting visibly and audibly frustrated no one came out from the back or behind the register to give the guy a hand so i helped him out someone who s probably been going to mcdonalds once a week for the better part of his life was going to walk out due to that system the man wanted a big mac small fry and a coke and the system is so unintuitive to the non tech generation
automation like this will eventually free humanity from having to work at all meaning we can spend our time making the world a better place instead of asking if you d like fries with that
i still work retail any time my manager sees hears me just ask someone if they need help she makes sure to thank me for doing it like i don t even see her nearby and she will still show up and thank me just for doing what s expected of me anyway not all bosses are jerks is my point
congratulations on being the first person on the internet to use literally correctly
shit like this always gets posted after the police do something bad
seriously that dog is probably out violating th amendment rights everywhere by now
whenever i kiss my cat she rubs against my face for more kisses she absolutely loves it i got her pretty young though might be why
my guinea pigs seem inconvenienced by kisses but not afraid and they re afraid of a lot of stuff
i think my dog understands misses as she seems to search for them by pressing against my face we don t lick her like she does to show affection so i think they relate both activities
animals even rats lick each other for grooming as well as greeting each other with their noses or mouths their mouths are used for many more uses than just biting and eating once they feel safe with you they know you wouldn t just chomp on em
animals groom each other at times so unless its clearly agressive you‚Äôre in the clear
i would probably say that at least in some cases they might allow it since they trust you hence not defending themselves while being instinctually afraid making them unconfortable hence avoiding it or closing their eyes
it depends on the animal most pets like dogs and cats can quickly learn you mean it as a sign of affection especially if it‚Äôs coupled with verbal praise and headpats
it s how mothers bond and groom with their babies so for many animals they all instinctively recognize it as affection
i have an old dog he still loves getting out for walks but he gets tired fast so i almost always end up carrying him home he s a little dog he will tuck his head under my chin and falls asleep as i walk home i give him a kiss and tell him he s a good boy and when i do he wakes up a little licks my face and then falls back asleep so sweet on the other hand my cat endures my kisses stoically
my cat loves it he‚Äôll purr and when i haven‚Äôt kissed him yet he‚Äôll push his forehead toward me because he likes the attention he also sleeps against me at night and will sleep on his back around me so i think he‚Äôs pretty comfortable with whatever i‚Äôm doing
you ve never seen rodentists rats will stick their heads in your mouth if you let them funny critters
i don t think we can explain it away anymore it s clear that most animals derive pleasure from being near humans it almost is as if we are meant to be their guardians
my cat has decided that the cat equivalent of a kiss is a soft bite so when he feels lovey or wants to reciprocate kisses he ll start giving you love bites
just like anything that‚Äôs grown up with another being animal they learn based on the thousands of experiences prior what to expect if you start the behavior and make it seem positive before they develop any fear for it they‚Äôll never react fearfully
dog owner here she has grown to love hate it she knows i do it out of affection but because dogs usually use their mouths in aggression or to bite play she went down the middle with growl crying it s very precious lt she is also a small dog so maybe it s that
seeing an animal close their eyes like that is generally a great sign of comfort not always but it‚Äôs usually a good sign they are relaxed and have no stresses such as worrying about predators around i see it as safety and comfort
its similarly to grroming for some mammals other animals its threatening but after a few kisses they realize its no harm so they just embrace it
i kiss my cockatiel all the time and he either doesn t mind or kisses me back touches my lip with his beak he is not afraid of people s mouth at all i can pretend to eat him and he is hust happily chirps away but he doesn t trust hands though
it‚Äôs never too late to make a change it doesn‚Äôt take much to make a positive difference i believe in you
if you re that self aware why don t you work towards fixing yourself it s never too late to change
there‚Äôs still plenty of time to change that my dude the past is the past and you can be as good as you want to be from this point forward use people like this as inspiration
i think a defining factor of garbage humans is being unaware they‚Äôre garbage humans and not recognizing kindness lol
everyone can be kind in their own ways this isn t the only type of kindness you may not realise it but you might ve made someone s day a whole lot better by being there or doing something for them that you didn t really think about you re a good bro too
the fact that you are aware of your shortcomings and appreciate these strengths in others is a sign that you re not a broken garbage human part of you might aspire to be that way since you recognize that it s good you just need to work towards allowing that part of you to come out and take over
you sound like you have the potential to do a lot of good in this world
i highly doubt you as a person are garbage i can completely understand viewing yourself as a garbage person but how we view ourselves can be very skewed by feelings of doubt guilt and anxiety you re not a garbage person and all you got to do is remember that you re a person capable of live compassion and great things even if that great thing is just making someone else feel like a whole human being you deserve love and everything that goes with it
hey relax the very fact that you feel that positive emotion within you when you watch an act of kindness speaks to the goodness of your heart it‚Äôs good to know that given a choice you would choose to be good thank you please help when you can but don‚Äôt put yourself down when you can‚Äôt
you‚Äôre honest though and realistic also self aware thats something many people lack too
this is good service have to assume she is being paid for her time i basically do my job and if i see someone fall i ll stop the help i m a pretty shitty person too if i found your wallet now i d turn it in i m pretty stable when i had to worry day to day about food and housing i would have stole your shit i m still a shitty person i m just no longer desperate
just because you feel this now doesn t mean it always has to be true people can make certain changes in their lives if they re willing to
well not too late to realize your flaws and work on them honestly seeing your own flaws is the hardest part
your capable of it you just need proper motivation there is enough of us in this world to help people that have been given the worst part of living
you definitely can though the people who are broken know best how much a little help can go a long way use your pain to motivate you to help those who are also suffering most people experience some form of suffering
if you recognize and appreciate what she‚Äôs doing you are absolutely not garbage‚Äîempathy is one of the most admirable human traits and if it makes you feel good to see this you‚Äôre a good person now you may very well be broken‚Äîwhen you‚Äôre in a bad place it‚Äôs easy to be self absorbed and even easier to shit on yourself but you are not garbage there‚Äôs help out there and it takes a lot of courage to ask for it you can do it man‚Äîi am rooting for you
i asspire to be like her i am nice and kind but i want to do more
yes u can resentments doubt and fear weigh down the human spirit release them with a step program and will be amazed
the fact that you acknowledge it means you are one of the better people in this world most people think they are the perfect person but they actually smell their own farts
the thing about being kind truly kind is that it requires being truthful and genuine which leaves you vulnerable because if your kindness is rejected it feels personal due to the honesty you approached with kindness gets rejected a lot because most people just aren t used to it but that hurt goes away and you try again eventually someone will accept your kindness with as much sincerity as you brought and that makes it all worthwhile which recharges you for the next act of kindness
just start small try to actively think about being kind you don t have to be great all the time any kindness is better than none
it s all in the emotions and the wiring of the brain you can change if you want it s all about breaking the habit of being yourself read dr joe dispenza very interesting and life changing it helped me ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
i‚Äôm broken too but we‚Äôre not garbage just start small and do random nice things for people it adds up and before you know it people will be saying the same about you you can do it
every garbage person i‚Äôve ever met insisted they had no room for improvement and they never have self deprecating qualities this could‚Äôve been you in this video and nobody would be the wiser to any of the qualities or past mistakes that make you feel ashamed i‚Äôm sure this wonderful lady has messed up a lot too or will and we have no idea everyday is a blank slate and perception is reality i am sure you‚Äôre great
i work in a very busy retail environment alongside my studies and have helped so many disabled customers over the years i remember this one particular couple who came in who were both blind so me and my colleague each took one of them by the arm and lead them around the store as personal shoppers i ve seen it time and time again these less abled people tend to be more humane and kinder then the average person once we were finished shopping i escorted them to our disabled access till so they could complete their purchase it shaved off minutes from my painful shift and i got to talk to someone who didn t just see me as a body that serves them it s these encounters that make you feel human again and appreciate what you have if not much always a humbling experience that everyone should encounter at least once in their life i feel
i too am garbage and selfish i‚Äôm glad not everyone is like me
the first step to being kind to others is to be kind to yourself you aren t broken or garbage just a person who went through a lot of trials and still manages to want to be better that s worth a lot
yes you are but for reasons you don t understand you can not spoon feed the disabled you can not film it you can not who re it out for fake internet currency on reddit and none of that will make you a garbage human what makes you a garbage human is piggy backing on a post that fetishizes compassion and posting your impotent self loathing for upvotes without a modicum of actual perspective or ability for self improvement the only people who have you beat are those rewarding your complete lack of character and agency with upvotes
kindness is a choice it‚Äôs true that some people are naturally kinder than others but they still choose when to act in kind ways you can be kind too you just need to make the choice to be kind
if you pick up a piece of trash next time you are walking outside you ve already made this world a better place and other people happy
"¬´¬†i m a broken garbage human¬†¬ª
no you‚Äôre not you can see the value in her actions and took the time to point them out you‚Äôre fine i trust that you‚Äôll do the right thing when the opportunity presents itself"
separate plastics and glasses would be a good start to be positive
try and surprise yourself and see how it feels to try this kind of compassion on and let us know
i would gladly do this sort of things it if no one else was watching but i can t bear do it in public knowing they ll be looking at me i feel so self conscious
gt i could never be this kind or selfless why not that s not a criticism it s a challenge it s also quite possible you ve done things for others that you consider small and insignificant that they ve considered kind and selfless that sort of thing happens more than we realize
i hear you pal but just saying that means you want to be better and i think thats a top quality if you ever want to talk rant or moan just message me we re probably in the same boat
she probably has someone in her family with a similar issue and so she knows how to step up and help in this way i wouldnt even know how to approach it but that doesnt mean that there isnt some other way you can help make the world a better place pick up trash after yourself dont litter hold the door for others say nice things to servers and cashiers wherever you go vote for positive issues and candidates instead of hate and profit just forcing yourself to think about positive things instead of negatives will eventually make a change in yourself and the world it doesn t have to be huge and it doesn t have to be noticed you ll know
the fact you even ackowlage this makes you better than alot of ppl im sure there would be plenty of people that see this and would just poke fun at her or him
i‚Äôm not sure why you‚Äôre being upvoted for this a garbage human who can recognize what constitutes good and for laziness or whatever won‚Äôt do the act themself unpopular opinion but that might make you worse than the average this is the reason there‚Äôs a tax on niceness
i used to be like this women but other people slowly broke me into becoming the piece of shit i am now
random acts of kindness really help change your perception and lead to great things i‚Äôm broken too it‚Äôs hard to make that change small things really do matter or even the attempt i‚Äôve found that even when i try even if it doesn‚Äôt work out i feel a little better about myself and start to notice small things i can do i think you can get there
being thankful and glad people like this exist is a start to who you really are you re noticing a side that is already within you
my jaded friend are you me i too on a small level envy selfless people
the fact this kind of thing brings you joy shows you‚Äôre not as bad a person as you think
why am i crying right now maybe because uts time people like us change and do something to better this world as i can see every bit counts good luck
fellow garbage broken human here your comment just made me cry and i‚Äôm sending you a hug
the easiest and best way to find yourself is in the service of others try being a volunteer can‚Äôt connect with people animal shelters are always looking for an extra set of hands to help walk dogs cuddle the cats and tidy up while the animals wait to be adopted be warned though a piece of your heart will go with them to their new home especially if you get close to a particular pet love is the risk we take good luck
i really doubt you‚Äôre as bad as you think most of us are our own biggest critics start with being kind to yourself then from there you don‚Äôt need to always be looking for a big gesture of kindness say good morning to someone and ask how they are ask a coworker if you can help them with anything call your mom or someone you care about just to chat or tell them you care for them maybe i‚Äôm wrong but being kind doesn‚Äôt have to be so complicated just start by doing nice things where you can
"gt yes there are two paths you can go by but in the long run
there s still time to change the road you re on"
hey buddy we are all a little broken it s hard to get through the day it s ok to start small some litter on the ground finds its way to a bin you did that an elevator button pushed for somebody else you did that it feels good every time do you want to know the best part it still feels good and it becomes a habit then you can do more
more often than not it s the most broken and garbage people that turn out to be the most selfless and caring
all you gotta do is when this kind of situational shit comes to mind do it i can be a true asshole but a month ago i carried a wheelchair user and his wheelchair off the bus because the hydralic ramp on the bus broke i watched the driver try for about a minute then asked quietly if it was ok to help yelled out to the bus for a second person carried him off you know you think about these things just do it as an example of being an asshole i almost got in a fight on the previous bus because a woman pushed through a packed bus and i said cant you wait till the bus stops and some shining night decided that was tough talking her and started causing a scene just do it you can be an asshole and still do good
youre telling me you could never feed a disabled person because youre broken tf are you talking about
you could not only is it within you but once you try it only gets easier
i have this problem where i always consider helping people but i never want help myself and if i need it i ask so i always assume that people don t need or want help unless asking for it
this is why it is ok to raise taxes and just pay for medicare for all as well as programs to help those who need it then we can just be tax paying garbage humans we get some healthcare too
you are neither broken nor garbage you have a heart a good heart something simple like helping someone load their groceries in their car will give you the satisfaction that will encourage you to do greater things i believe in you
gt i could never be this kind or selfless you can though that s the silly part we all can
all you need to do is imagine yourself in the other person s shoes imagine what you d want or wish for then do that for the other person
honestly even very small acts of kindness make the world a better place don t resign yourself to being useless the fact you care about this means you can brighten someone s day too
next time u see someone struggling with something just offer ur help regardless of how meaningless it might be
"you can be the person you want to be if you want to be garbage well ok
that sucks but it‚Äôs you being who you want to be"
there s always a ticket out of victimville with your name on it
i used to be too and then my uncle got als and i know i wouldnt think twice if i seen someone who would like the help
do one small thing put a single drop of bright colour into your pot of grey another day maybe add another with another small act of kindness the fact that you appreciate what you saw in this video and knew it had value is a really good start
if you think about it it sounds like you enjoy being an asshole a little maybe the secret is to do small deeds that help others and discover how satisfying it is then just skip the step in which that makes you feel guilty for not being a true good person because it s not true
that s a billshit lazy justification be nice or dont but it s all about your will
some people say that needing god in order to be a good person is shameful i admit it if i m not right with god i become selfish and just have a general distaste for other people throughout much of my day it s a quality in me that i hate but it s there nonetheless when i m right with god i find that i have effortless love toward other people
you don t need to do extraordinary things like this to be kind you can just be polite and have kindness in your heart not everyone deserves kindness but most people do don t judge the by the
trying not to think about myself is the hardest thing i have to do and i rarely succeed i really dont know what my true colors will be in those critical moments
if she spends any more time working in food service she s not going to be like that for much longer sadly
actualy you even don t need to do some big deal you can start with little help and than you ll feel better
i‚Äôve made multiple war crimes in multiple rd world countries and am a prisoner on the run after being convicted of pedophilia rape and manslaughter i think it is a little bit too late for me üòÇ
i d rather take it as an asshole being self reflective and understanding that compassion is a good thing honestly it takes a lot to do this at a hard likely low paying job no matter how how well meaning you are dude probably isn t even an asshole as most of us couldn t rise to this occasion and is just upset we all aren t as good to each other as the gif lady is
i recently quit my career to go to pa school because i want to help people like him i was living a selfish life in a lucrative career i met a disabled man that made me make the change it‚Äôs not too late i‚Äôm going to be a good human being you can do it too
that s very true starting at no harm no disrespect and no indignity is a perfectly adequate step too
i was buying liquid ibuprofen at the store the other day and an older man said something to me he perked up and started showing me all the stuff he was buying and the differences between my med and his he went on to talk about so many different things in the matter of minutes he started getting teary eyed and thanked me for having an actual conversation with him i have terrible anxiety and normally struggle to make a meaningful conversation but it melted my heart this guy was touched by it and actually cared about what i said to him
a wise man once said don t try to be a great man just be a man and let history make its own judgements
yeah go find a disabled person and feed them a sandwich
i think i would tear up while doing something like this
seriously eyes on the road all it takes is for someone to jump out in front of him and their dead
i was semi cringing waiting for something to happen throughout the video kind of took away from the majesty
there‚Äôs always one the driver is clearly competent enough to film and drive
especially since it wasn‚Äôt exactly a straight stretch of road i was stressed the whole time watching
yes and thinking this truck driver is distracted every day by a bird flying on his left this is how accidents happen
from what i heard its sounds like its italy small places like this drivers are insane they drive like crazy but never crash
that road might as well be a tree lined boulevard compared to most ‚Äútwo lane‚Äù roads in italy
he s not adding filters and typing awww in the corner while he s posting all over the internet he pressed button that took minor coordination to press the big red button right in the center by your thumb then pointed the eye looking piece in the general direction of left and up friggin bird warned him when a car was coming around the corner anyway
every day in the same spot same time i dunno man he s definitely using the vortices but he seems to be drivers side to greet the driver
it s not so much the turbulence it s the air that the truck is pushing up as it moves forward that the bird is trying to stay in it s relatively smooth as you can see he s not really getting buffeted around
it goes in the window and just chills sitting there though
it may have started that way but odds are the truck driver also carries treats for it those macaws are crazy smart if he s traveling the same route the bird would be exploring and he s got snacks the macaw is gonna want in
the parrot used the truck for about minutes at pretty low speed and could ve as well catch a ride on the top which is easier and safer to reach and there s no potential predator i d say all those things indicate there s some other reason the parrot chose to land in the cabin
if true then he would remain on the outside the bird literally got into the cab this bird likes that dude as well as the surfing the turbulence
i don‚Äôt see the two things being mutually exclusive haha bird seems friendly enough to me
it is indeed doing this but not just using it the driver says the birds name so i would assume they have a relationship of some kind
naw that parrot is being friendly you can hear it talk to the driver
it lands in the cab if you watched the whole damn thing
gt now i m sure some of you figured this out already but t t professional bullshitter
your just wrong though arent you this is frankie as stated in other comment a famously friendly bird you figured nothing out
stopped for the ocelot stayed for the archer references lol
you hear that they called you ‚Äòexotic‚Äô which is just people talk for awesome
how does the second highest comment have twice as many votes as the top comment
it‚Äôs cute because it doesn‚Äôt have any cartilage do you find arthritis cute
i mean if you think that only libs care about animals welfare you should probably take a look at your belief system
i do support cute cats being cute but i also think that animals should not have to suffer from being bred to hell for certain traits
people argue the same about halter quarter horses and it‚Äôs absolute bullshit breeding an animal for looks over function is one of the worst things humanity does a lot of breed standards are based off bad genetics ‚Äúline breeding‚Äù aka incest is also hugely popular in animals like scottish folds and different breeds of show dogs horses cats literally there are lines of quarter horses that are bred to have hypp which is a genetic muscle disorder that‚Äôs incredibly painful and shortens the lifespan of the animal but hey they look cool so what does it matter right get the fuck over yourself
in the last federal election in canada i voted conservative i love animals and animal welfare maybe you should take a look at your personal moral compass and decide for yourself what is important to you is owning libs better than caring for the welfare of animals i think not
probably gonna get lost in the other noise but it s hear here is a location a place somewhere to be maybe if you stepped away from politics you d learn proper grammar
huh i was sure you were a troll but you aren t which makes this comment that much more sad and disgusting
what a selfish thing to say and wtf does this have to do with politics pretty sure most people care about the welfare of animals
uhhh not sure how you think any comments here are influenced by our personal political affiliation well except yours suck it chump
can t we just let cats look like cats instead of deliberately breeding these genetic cripples
speaking as a human being with a similar condition involving fucked up cartilage development achondroplastic dwarfism let s not just ignore the downsides because it looks cute this kind of shit is painful yay i m cute because i m only ft tall as a result of it but i ve had to take prescription strength killers for my joints since i was a teenager and it will only get worse i may need crutches and i need multiple corrective surgeries i m not saying this condition is exactly the same but typically cartilage based deformities equates to malformed bones and painful joints that are very susceptible to degradation it s not fun
your instinct is to kill the organism so it stops being cute
i‚Äôve read something about this before i remember the conclusion being that you‚Äôre unable to deal with how cute the thing is and your brain‚Äôs logical step is to destroy the thing in order to be free of the overwhelming cuteness
i remember having a discussion with some guy on here who was convinced that people who feel cuteness aggression are less empathetic than normal people no matter the sources i sent him he wouldn t budge don t worry though that guy was either dumb or just wrong and very stubborn about it you are just as empathetic as any normal person
not squeeze it but nomnom it like i don‚Äôt know if i actually want to eat it but my first instinct is to open my mouth and go ‚Äúomomom i am going to eat youu ‚Äù
i wanna rough house it a little bit absolutely not pop it wtf
does anybody remember the name of that little girl in some cartoon who was like known for this she said something along the lines of i ll hug you and squeeze you and love you forever and ever while like strangling the main characters
ima try this hopefully i‚Äôll finally get the leg room in my own bed i‚Äôve always dreamt of
i buy new beds for my cat all the time because he‚Äôs spoilt and i love him but he will not use any bed that i encourage him to use and at least not for weeks the trick is to pretend you don‚Äôt care once i bought him a bed and he didn‚Äôt like it so i took it overseas to give to my parents pet they didn‚Äôt want it so i took it back to give to a friend as soon as i got home i just placed it on the floor and he was snuggled up to it quickly
found two of my cats on roofs assuming they only agreed to move in with me because their roofs lacked proper beds
in my case it was buy it for the dog dog never used it at least it s getting used
the key is to try putting it in different spots around the house eventually you will find a random spot where they will start actually using the cat bed for my cats they never used it when it was in the bedroom but when i left it in the hallway at the top of the stairs the other week they suddenly started using it everyday i guess it s all about location
i find just removing the cushion from the bed works cats seem to like hard flat surfaces for some reason
i will only drink from a running water source i ll die of dehydration i dont care try me my cat
i got my cat two years ago and bought him a bed he never used it once got another cat just a few weeks ago and she plays and fights with anything you put in front of her mysteriously my og cat has started playing with toys he hasn‚Äôt used in a year and he‚Äôs stared sleeping in the bed
how to get a cat to use a bed you bought buy the bed for a dog
how to get a cat to use a bed you bought by accident
took care of a stray wouldn t stay in the makeshift bed i made would try to get on my bed instead solution put cat bed on top of sock drawer which is higher than my bed with enough makeshift stairs via boxes for the cat to get up there
your cat won t use the bed you bought it will only use the bed other people bought
i get the kitty cubes or tents my cats ignore them for weeks so they are then given to the parrot cockatoo when he s playing on the couch immediately the cats that ignored it get jealous and start using it only after the bird uses it and claims it you should see the look on the parrot s face when he goes to climb in and sees a cat in his new playhouse or when he tries to daintily climb in around the cat that is filling all available space yes he ends up walking on them even when he tries not to then you see a cat who s irritated but knows it s not supposed hurt the feather brain eventually one of them peacefully gives up the space i m never sure who ll give up first honestly i m usually just glad i didn t waste my money and that the feather and fur pets work so hard to get along well except for the newest
i use my cat s bed to keep her off of things she hates it so much
try putting the cat bed on your bed in a more convenient location for your sleep like cat traps mine were so curious they started using their beds
i actually just put a cat bee on my bed my little just sleep there now
what do you mean my cat does rarley cuddel with me and if so he needs the treatment of a freaking king if i move he leaves if i not cuddle whole time he leaves if noise somewhere he leaves well he might be weird
you can also put a circle of tape or something there cats like circles
that didn t happen for us even after we upgraded to a king
put the bed in a high and dark location with at least walls cats love the secure quiet high spots
as a person with two lb dogs this will never happen for me i could get the biggest bed ever made and it wouldnt matter
i have a queen sized bed plenty of space for one adult human but somehow my lb cat manages to take up of it
have you tried sprinkling the bed with dried catnip every cat i ve had seems to understand the universal this is yours signal of catnip
try getting a king size bed we got one for the miniature horse we have
you mean the leg room you couldn‚Äôt dream of previously
i wonder how the dog bed ended up making it out of the window üòÇ
is the cable hanging down the side of the building your internet if so i‚Äôm no longer as upset with my cable companies horrible cable management rat nest at the side of my house
you are somewhere in southern europe right spain italy south of france
in my head the cat assassin creeded off the wooden platform into the pillow instead of a haystack
that s a long way i m worried for the dog get extra bars
do you live in serbia or the balkans by any chance i ve only seen this type of roof tile there
i hate it when the dog bed accidentally falls out of the window
of course people are confused about that redditors are confused about everything nothing complicated about something falling
please tell me you have shown this picture to the cats owner its so cute
your neighbor needs to fix his roof and keep his cat indoors
this doesn t explain how the pillow made it s way out the window
did the person who built the house below have a vendetta against right angles
or put a sheet of paper or open book on it guaranteed to lay on it
this worked for me i gave my cat his own pillow above mine and he sleeps there religiously now even if i m not in the bed
my boyfriends parents gave us their mattress since they got a new one we didn‚Äôt like it so continued to use our old one and placed theirs up against our wall until we could get rid of it cat ended up claiming it as his own and hasn‚Äôt slept in our bed for months now always fun to watch him run and climb up the mattress to sleep at the top
i had to get my cat a new cat bed a few months back i put it on the couch next to where i sit and a common place she would lay add in some cat nip and bam her old one spent some time on our bed when she was first using it
this also sometimes works with a dog i have her dog blanket at the foot of the bed so when she s done snuggling with me she will sleep on her blanket
i feel like this is true because my cat literally like to steal our pillows she s a pillow princess i just never really associated it with cat beds
got my cat to use her bed with the same concept she loves sitting on pizza boxes put the bed on top of the box and she used the bed non stop for like two weeks
i sleep alone in a queen size bed my sweet little kitty trixie insists on sleeping right up against my butt or behind my knees effectively giving me about inches of the bed to myself i hate to disturb her but have taken to putting her new super deluxe kitty bed up where the second pillow would go for another sleeper i let her settle in and have her bath leaning up against me then before i nod off i gently prod her up towards her bed she reluctantly goes in and curls up as i scritch her chin most nights she stays there sometimes she creeps back to cuddle next to me though i ve just taken to giving her a gentle prod and she moves for me
i have a queen bed and my cat sleeps on her bed where another person s pillow would be on my bed initially it was a box then a box with a blanket then i switched out the box with a bed and blanket now it s just the bed
i‚Äôm pretty sure my cat only uses her bed when i‚Äôm not home it‚Äôs like she doesn‚Äôt want me to see her use it because as soon as i get home she‚Äôs out of it and stretching i got curious one day and checked if it was warm and sure enough it was i‚Äôve never seen her use it when i‚Äôm home
put it in a cardboard box as well they are attracted to cardboard
anything flat and different that‚Äôs my cats‚Äô rule oh there‚Äôs a random piece of wrapping paper lying flat in the middle of the living room carpet yoink lay out a shirt on my bed flump spare bit of cardboard on the table mine it‚Äôs like a weird cat magnet
yep i just put a folded up sheet a little bigger than my cat at the corner of the foot of my bed it‚Äôs a cat magnet
my dog wasn‚Äôt using the bed i got her for at my office so i started working on my laptop while sitting on the dog bed on the floor days later she was glued to the thing ‚Äúthe human was here this must be good this is mine ‚Äù
plastic bags too or an xbox controller my cat loves to lay in my lap on my hands while im trying to play lol
what is it with kitteh and papers they seemed to love it
or manuervering around kitty paws whist cutting fabric i was intensely focused on scissors proximity to kitty that i cut the wire on my headphones instead and now the money i saved by making pjs from sheets bought at charity shops will go towards replacing gadgets
this worked for my wife all the way through her undergrad and masters one sheet of paper on the corner of her desk beside her years of our cat hopping up sitting down precisely in the middle of the sheet and watching her work
they like books best especially the catechism books oddly enough ours are super shy and are smarter than the cat traps

i live in india and i could swear this was next door how similar the world can be huh
my guess was mexico which despite being on the opposite side of the world shares a lot in common with turkey
it s funny how just by looking at the tiles and the laundry ropes i also guessed turkey bir ara topu a≈üaƒüƒ± atsa bari
why turkey looks like brasil in every way imaginable explain
i could tell from the roofs and the laundry wires reminds me a lot of where i used to live in istanbul selimiye
i was going to guess india those roofs are common over there
it‚Äôs bizarre how we can see a roof and know it‚Äôs turkey one of a kind country also those plums have me excited
it could be brazil as well everything screams brazil except perhaps the tv antenna
what about this picture is so clearly turkey it looks like almost anywhere in the world to me
i m curious about how people could tell it was turkey any dead giveaways about building style etc in the image
why are your poems always so good but so sad i‚Äôm smiling but crying over here stay well
it s my favorite awe pet poet striking again thank you
u schnoodledoodledoo can take top post comment and instantly make it x better
i am the dog that was my bed wind blew it out now cat s instead am not alone though days are long when my owner goes to work now gone but lately i can have a chat out of my window with a cat but still im not mad at the wind i lost my pillow but gained a friend
so lovely as always thank you always brightens my day when i read your poems
this is sooooo good üòÇ change the end to maybe someday he ll drop a friend and it s catpulitzer worthy
it‚Äôs so crazy to see it like that same with the video of the baby drinking coke for the first time or the cotton candy kid immediate total stimulation of their whole system makes me sad to be honest
that s why it s not only infuriating but also baffling why the sugar industry tricked us for decades into thinking that sugar is a okay and that salt is the cause of so many health issues now it s common knowledge how bad too much sugar is for us it leads to obesity which increases our chances of heart disease diabetes and a whole mess of other problems but despite that knowledge most of us still love eating sweets throughout the day sugar is too addictive for that industry to fail and yet they lied to us anyway
not to me lol i prefer not to have sugar in anything
sugar is the ultimate gateway drug it was our first introduction to stimulants and it happens at an extremely young age
i can here to post this same thing man sugar is some strong stuff
this is why i respect parents that keep no soda no juice no anything high sugarary drink wise in their house it creates monsters early on yes as a treat or reward now and again its totally fine some parents won t even do that it s all water for all of them all the time they can t control them in school obviously but it s so fucked when i see kids that are years old that are already have a full on gut and have a huge aunty ann s coffee slushie sugar explosion in their mits mom and dad don t look any better and are well into the morbid obese category but meh i know overweighht parents that stripped the house of sugary drinks when they had their first kid and stuck to it for the kid s sake the kid is better off it s so so absolutely fucked to get kids into the sugar cycle so young not just this gif in general
yup poor little girl not going to have a chance in life am seeing it already she gonna live in the streets as an obeast peasant wondering what happened
dude yeah anytime i mess with any kind of drug i always go back to the main squeeze sugar
he ll be chasing that dragon for the rest of his life
you made me smile with your convo thank you so wholesome
this could definitely be in a children‚Äôs book you should find a publisher and an illustrator and make a book consider a gofundme type of site to raise money and make it happen the illustrations could be the actual posts from reddit with your poems underneath also love the dialogue going on maybe i‚Äôll do an illustration for fun when i get the time not professional illustrator but own adobe illustrator ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
i am the man who dropped it then i did not think i‚Äôd make a friend my pillow is now on the roof occupied by a ball of floof one day he might come and see if there a pillow‚Äôs source could be if there pillow should ever make it back in it for cat there‚Äôd be a snack
these are beautiful and make the kind of nice story about new friendship you d find in a children s book i just finished a certificate program in graphic design and i kind of want to illustrate the scenes in illustrator and do a layout for it in indesign gotta keep the skill sharp with your permission it might take a while as i have other projects but i ll save these posts and let you both know when i ha e something to show
you two could actually publish it yourselves start small don‚Äôt invest too much money use the money from the sales to invest more build it up with the proceeds this is what mo seigal did when he started celestial seasonings i know i was there
and they‚Äôre a fairly smart cat breed too males can get up to pounds i‚Äôm hoping my next kitty is a maine coon
i just found out about these cats i really want one
they re easy to identify they all look like ron perlman
i follow the breeder on instagram they‚Äôre a pretty famous maine coon breeder out of russia
uneven work schedules like maybe the husband works at a year round school
because he s older already retired and is extending his stay at the beach while the younger wife stays in town to work and earn the money so he can extend his stay at the beach source am wife
their a modern couple plus she meeting her father after his biopysis
sometimes married couples want a break from each other lol
i mean there‚Äôs a ton of reasons it could be girl‚Äôs vacation work trip extended to have a few vacation days place the guy doesn‚Äôt want to go husband wants to treat the wife
because one spouse has much more vaca time than the other
which part of wife on vacation don t you understand lol
to finally have a chance of killing the cat and the mother in law
the husbands are homebodies so it s a trip with the other wives source am traveling wife to a homebody
the version i heard it was a brother breaking the news lol
possibly because they re individuals and have individual interests
i just went through your profile seeing your comments which are pure poetry and they are great if i had any coins i d give you another well deserved reward
i m like tearing up right now because this is such a wholesome and sweet poem üò¢
oh heck yeah even managed to incorporate the snoot boop one of your all time best schnoodle
these poems seriously brighten my day every time i see them thank you so much for your content
yasssss you always come through i appreciate you for giving these beloved creatures such a precious voice
i m guessing one of those extra crispy french fries that was left in the frier for too long
i wish i could stop putting large jalapenos in my spicy southwestern chili was most certainly a mistake
same bro i‚Äôm so fat from all the poop being stored inside me i can hardly walk
i started a mostly whole grain diet a few weeks ago i wish i could stop pooping
are they really dumb or just smart enough to get you to think they re dumb
i have a maine coon mix who isn‚Äôt very smart until i approach him to give him his pill i‚Äôm casually hiding the pill in my hand not making eye contact and acting like i‚Äôm going to walk past him and still he knows and tries to kill me before i can grab the scruff of his neck to pill him
we have a large tux that is probably part coon and he‚Äôs dumb as hell we love him but yeah ‚Äúimpressively dumb‚Äù just about covers it
i have had a couple in my life and one was definitely not the brightest bulb
depends on the cat a friend of mine had one that could do tricks and say mama would greet you at the door and i swear understood more words then they let on always watched people and made eye contact they also had another one that i was sure was a rag doll daily took steps that didn t exist off the ends of tables and counters sort of melted any time you picked them up very big doof of a cat i was surprised he knew where the food bowl was but that was probably just the result of trial and error
also have a maine coon and he is a total himbo beautiful but completely dense it‚Äôs fine though he can pick things up with his paw hands and plays fetch with toy mice it‚Äôs a bit like owning a black lab
my friends maine coon can play fetch he also understands that the laser pointer and the red dot are connected he‚Äôll get really excited when you pick up the laser pointer then he‚Äôll look at you to see where you‚Äôre pointing the laser pointer he‚Äôll also look back at you with a real pissed off look if you‚Äôre just jerking him
mine is of average intelligence i dont know where the myth came from cats do some derpy stuff in general
are they pure bred maine coons with registration papers that show lineage because there is a trend lately where every craigslist used and animal rescue started claiming they all have ‚Äúmaine coons‚Äù or maine coon mixes‚Äù lately of the cats i‚Äôve seen personally and been told they are maine coons or maine coon mixes were actual maine coons
gt his starry bright eyed apprentice that one looks so much like my cat and he is dumb as a bag of hammers
i swear to god you just copy pasted that comment from the previous times this pic has been posted here
judging by the saxo and bmw plus the thrash bin too much greece in a small length video
i was expecting it to be in turkey it looks so similar little buddies are so cute
grew up on euboea near halkida recognized the type of buildings and sidewalks
i knew it as soon as i saw the background i immediately thought this was nafpaktos at first
super lucky guess by u smarties s m r t the footpaths bins and cars all look like this in italy spain greece and turkey and that s just places i have personally witnessed i feel like there might be a whole mediterranean thing going on where things are very similar across national borders
i know nothing about greece but i do know that it has a copious amount of cats
my first thought as well i spent many days on vacation wandering the streets and spotting many cats on the streets just chilling it was awesome
plus the buildings are very greek it looks just like my family‚Äôs village
i looked at the architecture of the buildings and at the sidewalk and instantly thought greece
schnoodle i always look forward to your poems thank you üíï
aww come on man i can t be crying in the work break room ‚ù§
ah hell my eyes are leaking again need to see my eye doc
why does this poem remind me of porter robinson s shelter song
"so precious bella old girl i m thinking of you
and missing my faithful friend beaucoup"
one year anniversary of my yr old dauchshunds passing was this weekend not going to lie this made me cry
definitely fell in a cauldron of the gauls magic potion when he was a baby
he looks like vader with his helmet off at the end of return of the jedi
i love chonk babies especially when it s summer and you can see all those jelly rolls lol my kid had them until she started crawling walking when her chub turned into muscle i miss back when she had like chins
i don t mean this mean at all but the baby looks just like especially in the nd clip the baby from the tv show dinosaurs
our year old lab had lymphoma years ago it‚Äôs a tough battle but i hope your old pups can be strong in getting through it we have a pair of labs now who are just as snuggly and we love them so much thank you for the sweet reminder
i hope the best for both of them thank you for giving them both so much love they deserve nothing but the best may odin be with you always
this is so amazing to see and your dedication to them is obviously so pure i wish your family love and peace i think this is absolutely beautiful
now i‚Äôm going to continue to sit on the toilet in the basement of my gma‚Äôs house until it‚Äôs no longer obvious that i‚Äôve been crying
you should consider putting them down together i know i regret putting my dog through so much just for my own sake i wish i would ve ripped the band aid off
it s great thanks for this i m not generally sappy but this is so wholesome and sweet or bittersweet that it really hit home for me on a depressing sunday evening
man this sounds hard but dogs losing their partner is just as hard on them as it is us if they are both nearing the end it might be best to have them both put down together before things get too far
best wishes to you your wife and your doggies thank you for sharing reminds me of my yr old pups i lost a couple years ago just a few months apart it was devastating in fact i think we have the same orvis memory foam dog bed in the same color
sad that they‚Äôre ill but good that they have each other for comfort through their illnesses my current dog comforted my old dog in his senior years cleaning his eyes and ears playing with him gently checking up on him at the dog park pausing a fun chase to do so even humans are a great comfort to dogs but sometimes having another dog can be the best comfort much love to them both
all my best energy is going out to both of your pups my older dog passed away last year from pancreatitis so i know how hard it is when all you want to do is fix everything for them love them every day and be grateful that they graced your life
best wishes friend my lab of years passed in january and i miss him every day still your dogs look very cozy with each other it‚Äôs so heart warming to see
if it helps any my mom‚Äôs last basset was in heart failure for years with no treatments at one point my brother in law commented to us while said basset ran yes ran after all grandkids that she‚Äôs the fastest dog he‚Äôs seen in it because she was keeping up with the oldest three who are crazy fast
not even going to mention the pagemaster come on son
he s great in one flew over the cuckoo s nest even if it s not a huge part
he had a great professorial guest appearance on the west wing s ep the wake up call portraued actual constitutional scholar lawrence lessig knocked it out of course

did you see brad pitt in monkeys there s monkeys over here there s monkeys over there embarrassing smh
i really liked him in dennis the menace does that movie hold up
for years growing up i just thought he was aging incredibly well it wasn t until i was in my teens that i realized it was just the makeup and he was in fact only in his mid s when they made the first one
‚Äúmarty mcfly is a year old high school student whose best friend is a disgraced nuclear physicist and i shit you not they never explain how they became friends they never explain it not even in a lazy way like ‚Äúhey remember when we met in the science building ‚Äù they don‚Äôt even do that and we were all fine with it we were just like ‚Äúwhat who‚Äôs his best friend a disgraced nuclear physicist all right proceed ‚Äù what a strange movie to sell to be a family movie two guys had to go in and do that they had to be like ‚Äúokay‚Ä¶ we got an idea‚Ä¶ for the next big family action comedy all right it‚Äôs about a guy named marty and he‚Äôs very lazy he‚Äôs always sleeping late ‚Äù ‚Äúokay is he cool like ferris bueller ‚Äù ‚Äúno but he does have this best friend who‚Äôs you know a disgraced‚Ä¶ nuclear physicist ‚Äù ‚Äúi‚Äôm confused here this best friend this is another student ‚Äù ‚Äúno no no no this guy‚Äôs either like or even we don‚Äôt know how old this guy‚Äôs supposed to be but one day the boy and the scientist they go back in time and they build a time machine ‚Äù
gonna be sad for the kid dude prob gonna die any second
kid likes and dresses up as rick and morty not sure why the hell this has upvotes but whatever
in all that time i still cant unsee him in who framed roger rabbit it still haunts me
when you go bald early you look the same age forever
exactly the one i thought of then there was the blueberries blue berries camping scene
when my dad heard we were gonna see him and wanted me to ask him what does a yellow logh mean unfortunately i was so in awe that i forgot
this is literally the only scene i remember from taxi
rev jim was a great character on a show of great characters
i knew what it was before i even clicked it how the fuck he did that with a straight face i will never know everyone else was losing their shit even the extra behind him
i knew which scene this was going to be before i clicked a true classic
i have not seen it in years but can remember it vividly and i wish i could do a fancy link to it but the scene in taxi where the reverend jim gives lois danny de vito the blank check from his father and he has to figure a somewhat honest the interaction between the two was pure comedy gold
i do this to kids all the time and it never gets old
i knew it was the drivers teat before even clicking on it iconic
i saw bttf as a kid much younger than marty mcfly and it never dawned on me that this would have been an implausible relationship i had no clue what kinda shit high schoolers got into in their lives
great now i have to re examine how i look at the world
that s a solid bit and i loves me some mulaney but there s one thing that bugs me about it ferris bueller came out after bttf
as a kid i always wondered the same cause it really never does get explained then as a teen young adult i came to the sure conclusion that marty was basically doc brown s weed dealer and they had bonded over smoking herb and jamming on guitar together still seems like the most logical answer to me
gt whose best friend is a disgraced nuclear physicist and i shit you not they never explain how they became friends they never explain it not even in a lazy way love john mulaney but honestly bttf should be praised for this it doesn t matter in the slightest how they met just get on with the story and there s absolutely no way they could have explained that shit in a way that wasn t lazy clunky and expositional as an audience member i d rather not have my intelligence insulted over an irrelevant detail
okay okay okay i know this was all in jest but there is an explanation for how they met either in an earlier draft or the novelization doc needed help cleaning out his garage and put up a sign and marty answered he said doc gave him free beer and had a great record collection marty was also a music pirate
to be fair they are only friends not best friends not sure how much that matters but when i saw it in my youth i just figured doc lived in the same neighborhood in a smallish town and that s how they were friends doc was the neighborhood odd ball since he had seen marty come from the future and sent him back to the past doc was gonna hang around to see how it all played out
man i don‚Äôt laugh often these days but something about the ‚Äú or ‚Äù part made me spit out my drink thanks
grand torino karate kid up home alone the list goes on
who the hell wouldn t hang out with a crazy non paedo scientist in his garage now and then
if the movies were made today there d be entire youtube channels devoted to theorizing how they met and then when they don t address their fan theories in the sequels fans will call them the worst movies ever
reblog if you d have an inexplicable friendship with an older disgraced nuclear physicist
i would assume that it was dirt common in the s for young inquisitive brats who roam the neighbourhood and get to know other people in the neighbourhood working on their cars or bikes in their open garage or in their front yard probably just an extreme extrapolation from that situation amp x b so the real moral of the story must be don t be an inquisitive brat you might get mixed up with people on the wrong side of the timeline
marty was doc s einstein s dog walker or something like that i used to walk old folks dogs when i was a teen and mow their lawn
i want to say that early in writing they were going to explain their friendship by way of paradox marty meets doc in the past right after he hits his head and comes up with the flux capacitor idea he helps marty get back to the future and at some point befriends marty and completes the paradox i feel like they abandoned it because the movie centers around how it s possible to change the future and what they do about it and taking time to explain their friendship and not change it runs contrary to the flow of the movie total fan theory no proof
i hope you are not too disappointed but that is likely the best result i am not a kitten expert but that little kitty struck me as too young to safely remove from the mother may i ask how old it is i am guessing about weeks but don t really know if i am off about how old kitties need to be before they should go off on their own please correct me
in the halls the cat was inside the building and you took it into your apartment
i already had a feeling i thought that kitten looked way too healthy to be a stray
lucky you she‚Äôs going to ask you to kitty sit all the time
thank you i see far too many stories of found this cute kitty with absolutely no intention of finding out where it came from i can see why someone would be tempted though
plot twist elderly neighbor is on reddit saw your post and took their opportunity to snag a new kitten
reddit requires updates we ll be expecting a progress pic in a month
both happy for them and sad that i won‚Äôt be able to see more posts of the cat

i was thinking that they def should have mirrored either one of the images but the doggies are pretty cute so i ll let it slide this time
is it weird that i thought these exact words before reading the comments
i was about say this i can see you re a fellow humans that is bothered by these things
that s what i m talking about here s your poor man s silver ü•à
it now bothers me that they re not facing the same way lmao
it bothers me that in the second picture the white pooch doesn t have his arm around his bro s shoulder
it bothers me that their doing the mitch hedberg joke where everyone is slightly looking off camera as if there‚Äôs something going on over there
it s made even better because they re even looking in the same direction
it now bothers me that they aren t leaning the same direction
the confidence and smile the girl does the twirl with is absolutely adorable
you can see where it turns from in character joy to holy shit this child has actually amazed me
my reading of it is cute kid wait is she taking off her clothes oh my god she s a witch
so impressed her mouth is open i shock literally as soon as the little girl turns around s
anyone who wouldn t genuinely impressed would suffer from a lack of soul
except for chihuahuas i‚Äôm pretty sure they‚Äôre biologically predisposed to be ruthless snarling killers
it s both almost any dog trained from their youngest years can turn out evil or wonderful it is also true that many breeds are prone to more or less aggression in their genetics
when properly educated are very inofensive and i mean the kids the pitbulls are the most kind and lovable breed i ever know
it s not about the of the time they re great it s about the of the time something moves in their peripheral vision and they rip a kid s throat out
my dog is mistaken for a pitbull when i walk her but she is a border collie lab mix i don t think people know what a pitbull even is
agreed which is why as cute as this is i find it a little irresponsible to leave a toddler alone with a large potentially dangerous animal kids often have no concept of animal behavior and when they re crossing the line making a dog uncomfortable
that s not exactly true but it is all at the same time breeds do have traits that can be exploited abused and need to be considered pit bulls are very leader focused if you put a lot of effort into socializing them they can be less focused on this but you have to be intentional or they will often behave as the breed is predisposed to behave so if you re single or a couple and you dont take your dog to meet other dogs often and let strangers to the dog into your house often while they are a puppy they will likely habituate to their breed tendencies which is they will be cautious and reactive to strangers especially with regards to protecting their pack pack leader if you take an unsocialized pitbull and a stranger hugs it s owner you should be cautious of its body language a golden or a husky you d have no reason to even consider it s body language corgies are similar to pits in this way i hate corgies attitudes though because as small dogs their behavior gets glossed over this isn t to say or suggest that pit bulls are inherently going to attack or be violent but if they aren t socialized intentionally in their youth you ll have a dog that might have temperament issues that only crop up with strangers because of their tendencies and their physical power certain breeds are exploited for their behavior traits and their physical traits training can accentuate the worst of their traits and create a bias i mean this is how dogs have ben bread for their entire history beagles bay and have a great nose they also have great focus tarriers have incredible focus you cant say these things with out accepting that pit bulls are very pack focused defensive have you ever seen a shepherding breed that s lived in the city its entire life see sheep for the first time the times i have it s incredible how they act on a hereditary instinct they know they are supposed to do something with this creature they have never before seen huskies need work newfies need snuggles okay i think that s my genetics there i encourage you to discuss this with a trainer if you disagree with any of this
an aggressive chihuahua isn t going to kill you an aggressive pit bull though yeah they re bred to be ridiculously strong
i have a feeling that if hell is not govern by a chiuahua the ruler definitely has one
i think that stands for all small dogs thats where the saying little dog syndrome comes from i can never understand the attraction to them
my sister in law has two and my gf has one they re all super sweet even though i d rather have a larger dog
same as big dogs it‚Äôs the owner and how they are trained mines a mix and was a rescue and had a lot of issues she‚Äôs much better now but still had a moment here and there lol
they suffer from being small people have a tendency to discount their mental and physical exercise needs seriously chi s can be amazing hiking dogs and don t think they need to train them like a big dog so you get a very smart and energetic dog that never gets properly trained or exercised no surprise when they behave badly
when you turn a wolf to that purse dog that at any moment s notice can pop its own eyes off i think their behavior is reasonable fuck chihuahuas though
naw chihuahuas are great dogs can be pretty smart but if you pick them up or carry them around all the time and don t put them through obedience training and handle them like you would any other dog then they can become this way it s the owners fault after years i ve only seen chi participating in dog school
meeting a chill chihuahua is such a magical experience when you expect them to be barking their head off at you but they flop over for belly rubs and are actually sweet i really do think the owners play a huge role in that awesome sort of behaviour
no chihuahuas are just prone to developing little dog syndrome which is caused by the owners little dogs are allowed to get away with behaviours that bugs dogs wouldn t get away with because in small dogs it s viewed as xute or funny thus they develop behaviour issues that would usually be trained out of bigger dogs like barking jumping hyperactivity growling snapping etc this is a result of upbringing not breed
it still depends on the people all dogs need more than just love they need training boundaries and socialization most chihuahuas i have met have been dog aggressive and wary of children but they all had owners that either had rough kids or never socialized them as puppies with other dogs outside of the home or young kids outside of the home
considering how much a regular wedding dress is liable to cost its probably not a significant difference
thanks for bringing that use of the word ‚Äúgooped‚Äù to my attention
my wife made this and she actually works in wedding alterations it wouldn‚Äôt be a big step
holy shit i am so doing this it will be obnoxious af but my people will definitely get it thank you just need to get engaged now
i always do my best to stare at the ground when walking out to break while there are wedding parties in the lobby
i contemplated for a hot second having a tear away wedding dress lovely gown for ceremony tear away the skirt for a shorter more dance able dress for the reception after realizing how much extra that would cost at a seamstress i decided to be just a normal bride
i agree the child can attack the dog at a moment‚Äôs motive
children shouldn‚Äôt be left with any animal unsupervised
notice the camera moving they re actively monitoring her
i always hear this but i ve never seen any data to support it surely it s something people have been doing for thousands of years is there any literature supporting the idea that it s especially unsafe
if the child is alone and or unsupervised then where did this video come from
agreed that dog could roll on her in the night you also shouldn t sleep in the same bed as a dog as an adult but i cant remember why
surprised i had to scroll down so far to see this comment completely agree it s so careless
i agree she also shouldn t given toys with detachable parts she could choke shouldn t be given toys without detachable parts they can can be tripped over or thrown shouldn t have screen time developmental risks shouldn t be let outside injury and kidnapping hazards shouldn t be kept inside sharp corners and falling objects shouldn t be introduced to non family members they could harm her or family members same and why do they even have a dog in the house the fact that they re monitoring her in a bedroom with things in it instead of a hermetically sealed bunker proves that they re abusing that poor child if only they exhibited appropriate levels of caution like you do
get a king size bed and never have that problem again
my wife is short enough that it doesn t make a difference to her so if she goes to bed first there s a chance when i stumble into bed a half hour later i need to figure out how to somehow rotate the blanket degrees i guess making the bed would help with that
getting unreasonably agitated just reading that the struggle is real
the sheets are easy the edge with the longer fold goes to the top took me years to realize the comforter is square though
yes and you have to move to untuck it from under you re fat ass because you rolled over it times while sleeping and now it resembles more of a diaper than a sheet and somehow you can t get your foot out of it and then you unravel it moments before you yell out of frustration because you know it s responsible for depriving you of more sleep i hate that
i had the stuffing inside of a pillow turned the wrong way yesterday nearly had a full on crisis fixing it
i am currently stressed out about the blanket being over me in a wrong wayand struggling to find the long way as i am writing this
whatever direction your going it s the wrong one and you will find on the th or th side of this sided blanket
i struggled with this for a few years and then recently found out the blanket i use is a big square
get yourself a square blanket and then you are always right
you shoo them away as soon as they get on it they know they know
scream at the top of your lungs and start smashing anything in sight then ignore them for a day
i always used kitty be good spray a spray bottle of water
my cat learned through double sides tape and lint remover sheets he doesn t get on the counters in the kitchen anymore
not op but i did it with a spray bottle full of water
you just yell hey and clap and run toward them the millisecond they touch it and put them on the floor after a few times they understand completely
i usually start by yelling no really loudly and clapping aggressively i have a pretty serious mom voice practicing our st is due in a couple weeks and with the clapping they get spooked from doing whatever it is we don t want them to do if they continue to repeat the behavior they get scruffed and their heads get dunked under the kitchen faucet we tried water pistols and it would deter but not stop the behavior
this isn‚Äôt the original op i know this cause i hold the highest rated comment on the original post üò≠
by reposting a repost of someone else s cat and copying the repost s title verbatim
if this is a serious question it s all about tone and making sure to use a deep disapproving tone when they are on counters shoo them off they learn very fast my cats are never on the counters in our vision i m sure they jump on there at night when we sleep or when we go on vacation but they don t put themselves in danger around boiling water or knives when i m cooking and they don t mess with food that we re eating so that s what matters to me d it works
it is such a misconception that you can t teach train cats mine know that tables and desks are off limits because they were scolded and scruffed when they were younger and got on them does that mean i never find them in those places no but it s rare and i don t even have to yell just say their name and look at them and they get this oh shit look on their faces and jump down
by stopping to take a picture of how cute they are then yelling at them to get off the counter and confusing them
that would scare the heck out of me every single morning üòÇ it‚Äôs so cute how excited they are for us to get up and truth be told he‚Äôs been the only thing that‚Äôs kept me from being late for work more than once
my lab penny and my golden puppy shadow like homeward bound do the same fucking thing they dogpile me and only me my wife is left alone every morning at ‚Äúoh good you‚Äôre up breakfast ‚Äù
i had a black cat named shadow once i miss that little bastard
i love dogs but if i had to wake up to that every morning you can bet the dog would be getting used to being suplexed every morning as well
my best buddy in college had a tubby black cat named shades affectionately known as taters she would mew at you all day until you gave her some lovin then ignore you the rest of the evening but if you ever stayed the night there you were sure to wake up with a taters laying on your face i still miss that tubby goober
my bullmastiff has figured out that he normally goes outside and gets fed when i wake up so now he does this every morning
my dog tries to give me cpr in the mornings sometimes lmao
dont mean to be rude but isnt lb kg too much for a labrador
wake up hooman i really really need to go out you don t wake up and i ll pee in the carpet
my wife‚Äôs german shepherd liked to stand on her bladder lol
oh good you re awake didn t want to disturb you let s talk about walks
oof that s what my cat does though instead of being lbs she likes to nuzzle my neck and give me a love bite nothing gets me up faster than trying to stop her i fear the morning both my arms fall asleep or something
i get an elbow drop to the sternum from my lab waking up to his finest macho man randy savage impression every morning never gets old
i had a black lab named shadow i ll be in the corner crying
the morning smells nice and there is a squirrel outside hurry up doggie
my brazilian mastiff used to do the same to me he s roughly
my lab will come lay with me for about an hour before he demands me get up
when i am visiting home i get paw to face i wish bella would wake me more gentle way funny thing it is always me she wakes when i m there
i remember a lot of my disney trips and they were all before i was
i don t remember much of my first two disney trips even though one was pretty much once in a lifetime level not repeatable my mom remembers and she enjoyed watching me have fun we had good days together i don t need to remember everything specific that happened to cherish the fact that my parents took me somewhere that was intended to make me happy in any case it s discounting the fact that parents enjoy watching their children have a good time from a child s perspective having fun in the moment is still valuable people will tsk tsk other people for doing things like recording a concert because they should live in the moment and just enjoy it and they ll never watch it again but when it s a child people act like their experience having fun in the moment even if it won t be remembered years later isn t worth it
i have tons of memories beginning at ages and people are different my so doesn‚Äôt remember anything from before he turned
i am there are loads of things i don t remember i guess i should just stay home i don t understand why memory is the benchmark of having fun it was really really fun for me to see my kids having fun when they were little having small children is exhausting and changing up the scenery can do a world of good so do you think you should have just stayed home until you were twelve cause you don t remember going wow should you have stayed home from school cultural activities
i don t know where you got that year old line from but children have a fully functioning memory by years old at the latest
i hope you realize that memories can start forming as early as three i m sorry to say this and i get it i m like that too but most people can remember events before they were years old
i disagree my wife and i took our four almost five year old she doesn‚Äôt remember a lot about the trip but we do however that place is magical to a kid like and i‚Äôm glad we got to see it none of our other trips there compare
some things are done just for fun by your logic parents shouldn t play with their children before they are old enough to remember it
i went for my th or th birthday i think it was i distinctly remember having a cupcake with a candle in it brought to our table in the castle i remember peter pan coming over and kneeling down and drawing me a map to neverland in my autograph book i remember the dumbo ride and goofy‚Äôs rollercoaster minnie‚Äôs house and the paw prints in the cement sidewalks in the ‚Äòoutdoorsy‚Äô part of the park don‚Äôt remember the plane ride or anything else but i for sure remember those things vividly and i only went one time i‚Äôm now
we brought our daughter when she was almost she had an absolute blast that was over years ago and she can still tell you about it she can still tell you that her first ride was the teacups and that she didn t want to go on it at first then once she was on it she just kept yelling faster faster
not everyone has a family member or someone to watch the kids for that long soooo they kind of have to just because you wouldn t do it doesn t mean others don t have a reason
because we had days notice from the time the birth parents picked us to when we brought her home after waiting for more than a year this trip had been long planned to celebrate my niece s birthday
gt under i was years old when my family brought me to disneyland i definitely remember how much fun i had and what rides i rode
i told my year old son that disney world was just a pretend place like the north pole to get out of going
i went on a big family trip and watching my three or maybe he was four already year old nephew‚Äôs eyes light up seeing him laugh getting to sit next to him as he experienced his first ride totally worth it and while he may not remember every detail as he grows up the shared experience bonded us all together even more and that family bond is something he‚Äôll have forever we have great pictures and videos so that‚Äôs cool too
you don t remember anything before the age of holy shit
i don t understand why someone with no knowledge of a situation asserts their uninformed opinion i get that they may be excited and listening to their smug self assuredness is entertaining but they won t learn anything from it dude why not ask an honest question or rather than trying to criticize someone for decisions you know nothing about why be toxic particularly when you re doing so to a family who just gave a kid a new lease on life
i brought my kids when they were and it was the perfect age they could still believe the magic they might not remember everything about the trip but there are pictures and we talk of it occasionally still yrs later best trip ever
my kids were for their first trip to dw they are now and they remember we did small world a dozen times because one of them was so enamored
you can see she didn t know if they were ever going to be together again every time we go to work our dogs don t know for sure either that s why they re so glad when we come back
this happened with my shepard rottweiler mix one time she got out and some fireworks made her take off i looked for hours until i decided to go home for the night it was my deployed girlfriend s dog now my wife and dog in that order so i had more than a little amazing over her disappearance i left the front door open just in case she was a few years old so not a month pupper like yours it s not something i d recommend but i didn t have much of value at the time and was willing to gamble my safety i woke up in the morning to get sleeping on the bed i was relieved to have her filthy little body all over my covers congratulations on getting your puppy back
so glad jasper is back god forbid this ever happens again you may want to ask your vet about getting him microchipped
my friend s dog lester wandered off and was gone for days they hadn t given up hope but were very worried she d taken her daughters out for groceries on a rainy night and when they pulled up to their house lester bolted out from under the porch she told me that the noises he made were the same as her young girls on the ground in the rainy wailing love
as someone who lost his only yr old soulmate to cancer a few weeks ago i am crying over joy that you got your pupper back in your arms pls give him a hug
what a beautiful reunion i‚Äôm so happy you found each other
i m so glad you found him he has a lot of energy i hope you take him for plenty of walks and runs
why do dogs run away instead of run back inside or find closest smell and seek shelter
is it bad that i mostly want to know where you got those dinosaur pants
this looks like the trans canadian trail outside of stittsville glad you found your pupper
oh gosh i have a mini aussie and this is my worst nightmare i am happy he‚Äôs home
not trying to shame you but ran away from where off leash
jasper s reaction to seeing you reminds me of my grandparents dog snoopy they thought he was taken from their yard there was no sign of how he got out they searched for several days putting up signs all over town especially after a friend called and said she thought she d seen him on the other side of town but no luck then they got a phone call from a vet on the far side of town saying they thought they had the dog my grandparents were looking for nana and papa drove over so worried and scared and hopeful and the vet tech brought the dog out he looked so sad and tired and scared and then he saw my grandparents and just went nuts tail wagging and barking and wiggling and oh so happy the tech just laughed and said well there s no doubt he s your dog nothing looks happier than an ecstatic dog returned to his people so nana and papa got snoopy back and snoopy got to go home and live the rest of his life comfortably in his own backyard with his favorite people i m so glad you and jasper get the same happy ending
oh god i m so glad you got him back that must have been terrifying all the best to both you and your jasper that you re never apart again
lyft driver here i experience the other side of this in sd a couple months ago we had this huge lightning storm and i had driven a fare around am from the hospital to their destination min up north on the way home afterwards i noticed some mild traffic and a dog that had been hit and killed in the middle of the road some people had stopped and called police i left but came back since i had a truck i could transport the dog easier then anyone else turned out the dog lived right around the corner and it probably had just happened that he was spooked by the lightning cause heading down that same road not even min earlier there was nothing happening there so me and an officer loaded the dog in truck at the owners home we had trouble getting in touch with them but neighbors started calling police when they noticed flash lights and a brown male me walking around the property amp x b then it started raining and we finally got a hold of the owner who came out the most somber mood you could imagine followed as the grim reality kicked as i saw her sobbing and her kids in the background too shocked to even get close to the scene the officer and i then unloaded their dog and layed him down on the grass on their property you were very fortunate to find your dog
he looks like he got a bath after he got home paws are very clean
i m so happy for you all thank you so much for not giving up on him
hey you might not get to see this message but if you do i was wondering what that semi circle chair in the background is called i really wanna get one
i just burst into tears lol i can t even imagine the wreck i d be if my baby kitty got out
looks relieved to be back home and safe so happy for you guys
question had that walking heart attack ever walked km before in her life
i was gonna say i bet that they are canadian she is wearing sweetlegs out of a bc company
hard to tell who‚Äôs happier about the reunion so happy for you

your painting really captures the feeling of the moment
super sweet and a great painting it captures the joy perfectly
oh this is beautiful really captures the moment what kinda supplies did you use
as a brit i love seeing them i don t think we have them at all here i believe the grey squirrel out competed them to extinction here
i see it likes mixed nuts you know who else likes mixed nuts the red squirrel
this bit is oddly fascinating to me where i m from i have yet to see anything but reds but i m sure it s only a matter of time
i‚Äôve never seen a red üêø in real life before there‚Äôs black and brown grey season dependent squirrels all over my backyard though
red squirrels are honestly annoying as fuck in the woods lol they don‚Äôt shut up
what kind of a bird is that in the backgroun making those chirp sounds it s very specific
there s an albino one in my apartment complex it s super freaky looking in a good way not a bad freaky
me too but they re serious a holes in the north east us
squirrel is loving this lol look at the cup of nuts he has omg what s that lik a whole winters stash for the lil dude
like that super sexy one from disney s sword in the stone
reds were always little bullies to all of the derpy grays in my yard
i see plenty of red in the lake district more so the last few years
scottish here and were holding on to them in the north that‚Äôs why i love seeing them everyone else doesn‚Äôt get why i hate grey squirrels lol
i think there are a couple of reserves around the country one of them is at the center parcs in whinfell forest so if you visit there you can find them quite easily
i remember seeing on the news back in ish that the american grey squirrels were such a problem that it was basically open season to kill them was that for real
we do have them they are native to the uk but the grey is invasive and is wiping them out i see red squirrels very rarely in some parts of where i live mostly woods
they were forced north where the greys don t do so well
there are calls to introduce the pine martin in territory red squirrels border with the greys because they find hunting grey squirrels significantly easier due to them being ground based plus they need to be reintroduced anyway
there s the reserve up at formby too not a whole lot but we do have some in england
if you re ever in dorset see if you can get over to brownsea island they hav red squirrels over there and grey squirrels have not been introduced to the island as far as i am aware
fairly certain there are some small enclaves throughout england too stupid grey squirrels pushing the far cuter red squirrels to extinction in britain
when i was in secondary school many years ago i saw a red squirrel in the park near my school no one believed me
kent ohio is famous for black squirrel i guess they arent common anywhere else in the world or something
we have some in england too you can find them in formby merseyside
i had one climb up my trouser leg outside in scotland whilst i was fucked nearly kicked the poor thing away ended up being quite cute though
there s a small population of them on an island near my hometown called brownsea island don t know of any other place in the south though
gt i believe the grey squirrel out competed them to extinction here i never even knew red squirrels were a thing until i heard them discuss this fact on qi
there are also a colony of red squirrels living on brownsea island in dorset
i went to canada last year and boy let me tell you how cool black squirrels are
i believe the isle of wight is rather protective of the ones they have
i swear centre parcs did loads of conservation work with then and all their parks have red squirrels running around
there are some in the north west i think a population in derbyshire somewhere as well
we do just very few comparatively i did see the odd one growing up in wales but vastly outnumbered
they are still common in scotland all the way down to the lake district i saw some in bury when i was young but i haven t seen them now for probably years around here
the isle of wight also has red squirrels with not a grey one in sight
as others have said we do have them across the uk but might also interest you to know we have black squirrels too
we have the in formby pinewoods in the nw near liverpool but you re right the greys did them a bad one
they also introduced red ones on the island of tresco in the isles of scilly
i ve seen them at formby the lake district and in the cotswolds but they are uncommon
anglesey is a great sanctuary for them in wales i m going today in hopes of seeing some
edited my comment with that and the numbers the pine marten a badass weasel thing is being used to control grey populations
i don‚Äôt hate the grey ones but the red ones look way more majestic if you don‚Äôt see them eat in slow motion ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
the north remembers canada here we have a pretty large population of reds as well as the black eastern greys which are basically just greys on steroids approx extra testosterone
from there pacific northwest here usa and we used to just have the greys out here but now some black squirrels have shown up over the past few months and i m concerned we re gonna lose our native greys didn t realize there were some in england and scotland i m kinda glad that they re not just in the the us but i also feel for you not wanting them to take over your native populations
about years ago we had a little family of them in our garden in manchester which was hugely surprising they were the only red squirrels i ve ever seen in manchester dunno what happened to them though
we have little scraggly black ones here if it weren t for the semi poofy tail they would look like rats lol
michigan here in the city where i live my neighbors are fox squirrels they re big guys who don t move fast don t care when my dog comes out to bark at them and generally are pretty chill they ll bark at you from the telephone poles from a few feet above your head but they re nice to have around the red squirrels however are raging assholes they re half the size of the foxes and hate everyone they attack baby birds they break into my garage chew shit up and piss all over everything else they re contstantly yelling in the trees and nobody like them they suck the black squirrels are around here too but they have a very limited range they have one part of the city with a lot of open park land but they never venture into neighborhoods they re pretty shy
the reds you guy s have there seem pretty calm they are friggin a holes around here minnesota they are loud and aggressive they battle with blue jays a lot but that is pretty funny we call the blue jay s poop divers they will literally dive bomb you and drop a big nasty on you the reds steal theyre stash and go running it goes on all day
we have red grey and black squirrels running around here sporting different swag i‚Äôm partial to the black squirrels myself
do you have black ones very rare pockets in the north east and midwest us
they re in formby in the north west of england too near liverpool
australian here we dont get any squirrels of any type
i m from scotland too and i ve seen exactly one red squirrel in the wild it was sitting on a fence post as we were driving past on the north road of loch tay i was super excited
my dad hates the grey ones too they re killing off all the red ones here in sweden
dogs are great cats are great humans are you can find some great humans
i m weird about dogs everyone else s dogs are great and every one loves me every dog i ever had was a bastard in one way or another small story honestly it was probably because i was a kid and didn t know better how to correct them but i had a jack russell terrier yes i see my mistake now who would destroy anything he could get his jaws around and cost us thousands of dollars of the six weeks we had him a few years later when we visited him at the friend we gave him to who had a massive back yard and didn t keep him cooped up inside he showed us a fence post the little psycho had chewed through not once but four times despite a treasure trove of chewtoys lovingly provided in a house he had free roam of meanwhile almost every other animal i ve met was well behaved with me and liked me with the notable exception of equines for whatever reason donkeys and horses that are kept as pets except riding horses that are taught to tolerate strangers universally seem nervous around me so i keep a respectful distance
thank you i know encounters like this are special to people but it s so damaging to the animal habituation is a killer enjoying them from a distance is the best thing we can do for the wildlife we love
most squirrel i see are hangout by fast food trash cans and no one but the squirrels made that decision
squirrels we re literally introduced to city s to bring some nature closer to us squirrels are barely wild animals
looked like this was occurring in a park parks are usually in cities i disagree with you because in a city environment humans and animals usually share a small space there will be massive overlap so you can t really judge that behavior the same as something out in the middle of the woods its no different than seagulls begging for fries at the beach the animals are taking advantage of an opportunity can t really fault them for it animals hanging out in a park are going to get used to humans regardless of if we feed them or not so i don t really get your point unless you expect people to not frequent public parks if squirrels are present
if you think the squirrel being fed by a single individual is gonna make him think right away that all humans are like him you got adaptation wrong
i came here to say this some people just dont know amp x b im sure this guy doesn t know and is innocent and all that but it still upsets me
but but cuteness it s so worth decimating local populations of their species
that s why you have your moment then scare the ever living shit out of it as you re leaving trying to pick it up and start screaming at it i guarantee that squirrel will think twice about trusting humans so easily again
plus that tetanus booster won‚Äôt be fun when you accidentally get bitten
is it so wrong to sacrifice one squirrel for cuteness
the lack of fear of humans is a bigger part than most people realize yes many squirrels already go into trash cans and dumpsters but they are still cautious around humans once they lose that though they become more aggressive about getting food this leads to squirrels needing to be put down for basically attacking people for food this can be seen at basically any american college campus because students love to feed squirrels
exactly it s cute as heck but what if that squirrel jumps on someone else s leg looking for nuts not cute dangerous for all involved
it could be a bit of a grey area heh when it comes to red squirrels introduced grey squirrels are out competing them and driving them to extinction their impact on the ecosystem is going to be a lost cause in most places you could also tentatively make an argument that feeding exclusively red squirrels might be a much needed edge in their survival
i came for this inevitable comment i think it s a little late for that if you haven t notice squirrels run rampant in the cities and it s not because we feed them it s because we destroyed their habitat i love how we draw the line at feeding them and not a breath wasted on the fact that we destroyed their environment
pretty sure people have been feeding wild animals since the dawn of civilization fam it‚Äôs one squirrel who gives a fuck
nah i m no expert but the edges and lighting look legit even a couple stray hairs that interact as expected with the rest of the photo
it may look shopped because the dog is out of focus while everything behind is in focus but this is totally expected so i don t really see why it would have to be shopped
i think the photographer is just holding up the dog
i honestly can t really tell at first glance it looks obvious but the right side looks so clean the left side looks shopped but i wonder if that s just the lighting the blur can just be explained by the fact that it s focused on the baby but this is just weird
it doesn t looked shopped but it definitely looks like someone is holding it up
it s the new portrait mode in phones it artificially blurs background to highlight the focus point it makes the edges look a little out of place
it is people have photographed an analemma the shape the sun makes in the sky if you look at it at the same time in the same place which takes a year
i think some of the pics from super far deep space take even longer exposure times
i think the dog is just as shocked that she took so long
props to the kid for still being excited after all that time pretty soon she‚Äôll have a cell phone in her hand right guys
gt five months seems like an awfully long time to take a picture shutters hate her
maybe he s a planet earth photographer doing one of those seasonal time lapses
same here black lab pit mix ripped but loves sleeping all day
i thought you gonna add bench press towards the end
lmao same my staphi is jacked to all hell literally rippling with muscle and he s the laziest of all my pups
got a boston terrier pitbull mix she s such a sweetheart but will rip your arm from its socket if your standing still while holding her leash and she takes off
exactly my pit sleeps like hours per day and is a couch potato but looks like he lives in the gym
definitely genetic hell i have rottweiler and they all do the same exact things eat the same food sleep the same amount etc but one was just born with different genes and is meaty af she‚Äôs just all muscle and will always be that way
the whole front half of my pit mix girl is stout she spends a fair bit of her time rooting rocks out of the ground then carrying them around like trophies current record is lbs
can confirm pit owner here my dog does jack shit all day and he s still got those arnold genetics
yeah mine is ten now and does approximately of the things to make her swole just sleeps and walks still jacked
having moved to the midwest god i miss cookout whitecastle is nice but i d trade it back for cookout in a heartbeat
the first time i had cook out was in north carolina it was awesome then they built one in my hometown and it is the most notoriously filthy and questionable fast food joint in town it‚Äôs a bummer
doesn t matter how often this gets reposted the majority of the comments are always about the damn cup
as someone from the uk i m just wondering how the hell someone drinks that much milkshake
literally eating cookout as i watched the gif and perused the thread
white castle gt crystal cookout gt everything but culver s which we just got here in georgia
i would make passionate love to a cookout quesadilla right now
tried it the first time on my way through newport news va awesome
actually the cincinnati children‚Äôs vascular access team was needed to give her iv fluids because her tiny preemie veins could not sustain the ivs her vets would place she‚Äôs one very lucky girl to have been born with access to such amazing care
i‚Äôm from cincinnati and fiona is a local celebrity she‚Äôs on cups and t shirts at our local restaurant chains and there‚Äôs always a line to see her at the zoo fiona is the lil sebastian of cincy üòä
i remember reading from somebody in cincinnati that the city could take or leave the bengals their nfl team but if anything happened to fiona there would be riots in the streets not sure if that s true or not but it definitely sounds like fiona has become the city s not so little anymore mascot
i just saw her days ago she‚Äôs so happy and huge now
a couple days ago was the facebook memory day when i fed her dad henry a whole watermelon at his old home in springfield one day i ll stop by and see her
this is awesome i too was born two months premature and saved by cincinnati children s hospital now i feel like i m related to a hippo
she also provided a some very much needed positive pr for the cincinnati zoo after harambe
i live in nj and shes hung up on my wall the queen of the queen city shout out to my cinci friends for sending shes the best
they give a hippo free oxygen and then charge the human beings
sad to say i live in cincinnati and i‚Äôve never seen her the last time everyone in my family went i was horribly pregnant and didn‚Äôt want to trudge around the zoo we‚Äôve not gotten passes since
gt normal weight is lbs jesus christ newborn hippos weigh as much as a full person
i made the hr trek to see her last year and i don t regret it at all such a lively baby plus all the other babies the cincinnati zoo had that year made it a worthwhile trip alone
i ve heard a lot of stories from the cincinnati zoo i think every time someone bashes zoos or something i always think of those zoos where the animals are actually cared for medically and personally and i think cincinnati comes up often and maybe a few others i forget about one of them helped rehabilitate the population of something like antelopes wild deer in a region of africa or other stories like that
my mother has been following this hippo like crazy before she was able to be publicly seen the day they let her into the habitat we took a hour drive up to the zoo one of the coolest zoos i‚Äôve ever seen
liberals would ve liked the hippo claiming it s a bunch of cells
i have family in cincinnati and i can‚Äôt describe how deeply invested that city is in fiona
we may have lost harambe but nothing will take fiona away from us she‚Äôs our lil sebastian
i remember this damn hippo in those science world magazines from class goddamn i hope she‚Äôs doing ok
that s not alive according to most of reddit so it should have been aborted destroyed
clicked to find out if it was her i live across the country but it‚Äôs adorable how much pride your city has for this hippo
how the fuck do you know how to tell the difference between any other baby fucking hippo lol
her dad henry used to be at my local zoo they put up a little memorial at the zoo after he died
hey this is the kind of news people need after a work filled day keep those hearts going
gt and not just any hippo but fiona the hippo the way you said that haha üòÇ üòÇüòÇ thank you for making me and my friend laugh
i‚Äôm sorry but we‚Äôre gonna have to need a banana placed beside her for the purpose of scale
i live in cincinnati and i can confirm that fiona is the cutest hippo ever even though she s growing up fast she ll always be our miracle hippo
i ve been considering getting a year pass to the cinci zoo haven t been for almost years
there s at least one other mural downtown with her in it i can t remember where exactly but i noticed it last week
we love her so much she‚Äôs been a huge morale boost since the harambe shitshow
i have also preached she‚Äôs lil sebastian of cincinnati down to my cousin sending me pics of studded fiona right alongside stuffed ponies
this post is so wholesome it makes my cold heart warm a little
my favorite thing about fiona is her moms name is bibi and together they are called bifi üò≠
people can say what they want but i love living here in the
that makes me really happy to see cincinnati has moved up a few pegs on my ‚Äòcities to move to someday‚Äô list
every city needs their own lil‚Äô sebastian i love this
and her own ice cream flavor which i ate just today
so exciting to see other cincy natives on here fiona is an icon
is this over by ziegler i‚Äôm trying to place it from the kroger building but can‚Äôt quite figure it out
yeah she totally made everyone forget about harambe
wait where is this i‚Äôve seen loads of the murals around town but i find out about this one after i move not fair
holds a baseball bat i d be a real shame if somebody didn t smile when looking at that mural almost like they wanted a bat to the knee
the fact that you described her as ‚Äúcincinnati‚Äôs lil‚Äô sebastian‚Äù is just amazing and puts her importance into perspective for me keep rockin lil fiona parksandrecgang
it will not use the litterbox no matter what we do omg hippo shit stinks
karma farming trash double posting won‚Äôt help your case much
just so you know it was in one of the top posts of the month may
general rule of thumb is if you didn‚Äôt take the photo you don‚Äôt have the right to post it unless the person who did gives you permission
yeah it‚Äôs spreading a lot we‚Äôve got them in mississippi and pretty much every state from here up to nc i think
they have one in virginia in lynchburg where i used to live but not as widespread as north carolina where i live now there is one in every city just about i m pretty sure there are two in raleigh
sc and bits of va if i m not mistaken i live in western nc and the nearest one is like a min drive when i lived in greenville sc i remember a few being there i don t think there are any outside of this region though
there is exactly one in maryland salisbury to be exact damn shame
i ve had it as far north as richmond va and as far south as charleston sc i believe they are somewhat common across the south east
huntsville al represent we just got one and i was so excited after moving from boone
east tn it‚Äôs definitely a regional chain but it does extend beyond nc
can confirm my fianc√© is a nicu nurse they‚Äôre a special breed for sure
we definitely did and we‚Äôll be back for a happy visit for sure
nurses that cuddle for a living to love unconditionally a tiny little unfamiliar that needs it so badly just to survive
first thing i thought of too as happy as we were to take my daughter home we were also scared sad to leave the amazing nicu nurses that had become family to this day i can t fathom how they do what they do every day
it s amazing how people come together through trials such as having a child in nicu one of my high school friend s first child spend months in nicu and she now has a group she runs around with who all met there and bonded over boosting each other s morale
up till i was about i‚Äôd still come back and the nicu nurses would recognize my mom and be amazed that i actually lived
my daughter was in the nicu for a week when she was born the nurses there really are great and supportive made things a hell of a lot easier
at the nicu where my sister is a nurse they have an annual get together for all the nurses and the patients who spent time there she says it is one of the best times she get to see all the little ones she took care of seeing a the toddlers walking around knowing that they so tiny and premature really makes her day
against the grain here my step mom is a nicu nurse and she‚Äôs only in it for the money she‚Äôs actually a really self centered terrible person who just happens to work in a redeeming field because it pays well she thinks working nicu is her gift to the world and she shouldn‚Äôt have to do much else to help people ever i‚Äôm not saying what she does isn‚Äôt important but she‚Äôs not doing it for the sake of altruism in the slightest
absolutely my son was in the nicu for days which isn t very long compared to many babies in there and every single nurse we had was amazing i was honestly sad that we wouldn t be seeing them anymore after we were discharged we went home and immediately had a bunch of flowers and a thank you letter sent to the nicu different breed for sure
they‚Äôre amazing i was a nicu baby we went to a reunion when i was about and they immediately recognized me and rushed over they‚Äôre a special type of person to be able to give that much love and care
same i tried teaching my current dog to play fetch as a pup and he just didn t care he preferred to eat flowers and roll around in bushes it was a little saddening cause my old dog loved playing fetch and it was an easy way to burn off energy he s a staffylab so i guess that part of the lab didn t come through lol
it really depends on the dog i had dogs i could not teach anything and one who picked up tricks like it was nothing and immediately understood what i wanted him to do
i can t get my dog to look at me when i try to tell him something
well do you beat him or punish him when he doesn‚Äôt obey and give treats and positive reinforcement when he does i only do the positive part and it takes so much longer than the regular method but i don‚Äôt want my dog to be afraid of me
i managed to teach my dog to fetch by first teaching her to play tug of war then i would thow the toy and she would always bring it back because she wanted to play
i thought fetching was something that they just naturally do my dogs don t fetch they just retrieve and take their toys back to their hiding spot
yeh mine was exactly the same it took me about week to teach her how to walk on a lead people s faces as i used to try drag her down the road
my dog plays fetch in the house only never outside because outside there s so much more fun sniffing everything so we carefully play piggy in the middle with the dog in the house to burn off some energy
if you see it another way this dog is helping you burn of more energy by having you have to plant new flowers every other day
get a clicker and find treats your dog will go crazy over any dog can be trained some just take more time
i tried teaching my dog with treats he didn‚Äôt give a fuck was just like ball or gtfo now the struggle is getting him to bring the ball once he has it
have you heard of a flirt pole it s basically a huge cat toy for dogs you get a pole and some rope tie a toy to the end and your dog tries to catch it while you sit on your butt and lol some people use a lunge whip purchasable online with a toy tied to the end i used some in pvc pipe a couple end caps ft of rope and a squeeky toy to tie at the end
our dog absolutely refuses to chase anything and she s lab there s just no prey drive whatsoever you re lucky if she noticed you threw something at all if another dog s playing fetch she ll happily join in without noticing why they re actually running about she just sees it as a kind of mutual zoomies i guess the ball need not be involved
i had a staffy cross lab they don t play fetch well but you will now also have a constant shadow that doesn t understand personal space and trips you over
i take it you found something else to do with the flower destroyer
try to entice him in a different way maybe throw the ball and you run and play with it dogs learn from watching their pack mates show him how put the ball on a string and tow it behind you whilst you‚Äôre running around the yard having a good time he should join in to have fun dogs have a great sense of humor maybe get a kiddie pool and throw the ball in there paw at it like a pup and make it roll around or add water and now you have two mediums to play with you can spark interest with anything just takes you to show interest and have fun too being creative helps as well good luck
my dog also wasn‚Äôt interested in fetch until i got super excited about the tennis ball she watched me throw it across the yard run after it acting all excited pick it up and throw it back to the other side for like an hour
in french chat chapeau in spanish el gato in a sombrero
i d rather watch this puss for hours than that fucking movie that shit looked creepy as hell
it s a backwards hat you gotta make it good da kat n da hat
it‚Äôs ok when their kids run rampant and uncontrolled they‚Äôll be the ones suffering
what does punishing a dog entail to you unless you catch them in the act punishing them is going to nothing except make them afraid of you
a lot of people don‚Äôt have a good grasp on the difference between punishing their dog and just beating the shit out of them hurting them without actually teaching the dog what they did wrong
punishing a dog after the fact doesn t teach them anything they can t connect the punishment to the act all those people who think the dog knows what he did are dead wrong he s just scared
can‚Äôt tell if this is a troll account this this idiocy actually got upvoted
gt imagine how much of a shitty parent you are probably beat your kids stop it s objectively wrong
this comment says what i was thinking but written by a youtube commenter
yes punishment is out of line they won t understand they won t connect it to the behavior to want to avoid they will just learn fear it does not work to punish dogs i m such a shirty dog owner that my pup is now a working service dog
unless you catch the dog in the act they aren t going to connect the act to the punishment just that you are upset and they don t know why on that note i m not a fan of any kind of punishment for dogs even if you do catch them i have an incredibly polite and well behaved boy that i trained almost exclusively through positive reinforcement he understands no stay drop it etc and never gets into anything he shouldn t
wow that was more than a bit unnecessary imagine how much of a shitty person you are damn
some kitties don t mind water some very rare kitties love water my friend has a cat who is obsessed with water she has to keep the bathroom door closed when she is pouring a bath otherwise she finds the little dork doing laps of the bathtub xd
look at that cats pupils they are definitely not calm plus it s a photo not a video
don t their pupils expand when they re afraid or excited
look at the ears that s not calm that s at best a submissive and terrified cat
that cat does not look calm at all look at the dilated pupils when my cat looks at me like that it means it s about to strike
the eyes are big he isn t so calm he is being very trusting and letting it be done though
my kitty will scream bloody murder if i put her anywhere near water however she loves to knock her water bowl over and tap around in the water on the ground i guess she doesn t mind wet paws but nothing more than that
are we looking at the same picture his eyes say anything but calm
"‚Äúi‚Äôm done adulting let‚Äôs be manatees ‚Äù
‚Äúsecretly a sea cow‚Äù
‚Äúoff duty trichechidae‚Äù i need to go put these on t shirts and coffee mugs"
maybe it s just me but every single photo i ve seen its a captive snow leopard that does this i ve not yet seen an image of a wild snow leopard doing this this leads me to think it s due to stress or anxiety these are very solitary and secretive animals by nature that generally in the himalayas live in sq mile territory sizes being cramped up in sq feet while a throng of humans gazing at them one would think they are very nervous anxious
about half of the ultrasound pics of my oldest daughter show her hugging her umbilical cord like it was a blankie yeah that s random
it s pretty cute probably helps with balance or something
they do this to warm the air they breathe although i m sure that it had the effects you re describing too
i was reading that they will do this to help keep their faces warm as well
probably nervous that there‚Äôs this human following him around carrying this contraception and pointing it at him making clicking noises
here s another cat fact for you the snow leopard is carnivorous its diet mainly consists of ibex argali and blue sheep
today i learned im like a cat but my tail just points the other way
sorry you have no choice now darla clearly runs the house
sorry reddit took a vote you have to keep the kitten
omg please don t separate your cat from her new baby üêàüêàüòª
if you can‚Äôt be bothered to have a third cat you aren‚Äôt worthy of your username
your husband is a senator you can afford to keep him
oh god you have to keep him darla and i will be devastated if you don‚Äôt
you can‚Äôt take away the baby they obviously have bonded they‚Äôd never forgive you taking away the kitten could be the breaking point for an already sad and antisocial cat they need and love each one more kitty isn‚Äôt much bigger kitty will take care of baby kitty
please keep the kitten for her i ll send you a donation
they aren t in the watermelons they ate the seeds and they grew them in their stomach
i can just imagine how sticky they are going to be when someone gets them out of their swings
looks like china or japan in both countries watermelons are considered a food for the affluent and to eat one is considered good luck bringing prosperity to your family in china tibetan mastiffs are also considered a symbol of wealth and luck with money
that s a really neat tattoo also you seem like a cool and fun teacher so keep up the good work keep on keepin on
my first thought was that your tattoo was stanley goodspeed nic cage from the rock but i figured that was wrong aaaaanyways back on topic cool dress
dang i was hoping it was a robert muller tattoo mulder cool too though
the school didn t give you shit for that i thought with the pc culture today tattoos would have to be completely covered
cutty bage i‚Äôd recognize her work anywhere eventually i‚Äôll get an appointment üò≠ awesome dress awesome tattoo and awesome wings your makeup is on point girl
really nice piece i have two full sleeves so i really appreciate others ink do you do your nails yourself is sns hard to do
does the school principal have any comment on showing tats just curious i think it would be an issue down here but i m in south mississippi fun dress
dude please tell me you will have agent scully added as well if not still amazingly awesome
i looked through the history and saw your woven sightings blanket immediately ordered thanks
awww cutty is a very close childhood friend of mine
every art teacher should do this and have a wardrobe contest at the end of the year
my member doesn‚Äôt have hands did you think think it was doing that on its own
i think my class did something like this in the s except we used puffy paint on a sweater
i ve never seen redditors referred to as members makes me feel fancy
sorry to use this comment to ask my dummy question but i don t seem to be able to comment on the top level how can i post a comment that is top level feel free to roast me point me in the right direction
the only problem is i imagine it might fade with time washing if they were or knew someone handy it would be really neat to embroider over the pictures i had a shirt when i was a kid that had all these child like drawings of animals embroidered all over it with badly spelt names underneath them probably made in some non english speaking sweatshop unfortunately but i was a kid and didn t think about stuff like that and it was my favourite shirt growing up i was so sad when i grew out of it it would be really cool to have something like that that also had a personal connection
step be attractive teacher step steal other attractive teacher s idea from the reddit front page step post your own version for karma step profit
for my school they get classes to sign furniture one teacher has a podium with signatures and another has a stool
there are several hundreds of teachers who do this or similar for years they don t all post about it though i m from a cold climate so the end of my first year assisting in a classroom of kids with special needs the teachers and parents had the kids trace their hands and write their names on a white sweatshirt for me
now there s two of them this is getting out of hand
i had the two posts right on top of each other kinda confused me at first
awesome these should all be in an aww collage or something lol
the og herself i really hope this becomes a tradition for art teachers and we were all here to see it start
i actually initially thought this was a repost now i ve learned it s apparently a trend neat
ms white started the trend she did it last year too i believe
haha right this is about the rd one today but still very lovely and cool
bet a lot more dads pick up their kids from her class
what i‚Äôve learned only a single white girl is ever original but originality doesn‚Äôt beat the happiness of all the students nice
where were all these super cute art teachers when i was in school
you might get downvoted but i was thinking the same thing this is nice and all but i come here for cute animals not this look at me stuff it just seems weird
i mean what‚Äôs she gonna do not try to look cute when she posts herself online don‚Äôt think that was her primary intention but i‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs welcomed collateral
imagine seeing a woman in any context whatsoever and assuming she s only here to be pointed out and jeered at lol zero irony detected eh
not to mention the photoshop what kind of deformed left arm is that
it could not be clearer from the thumbnail and the title what the contents of this post is why click on it if it is something you don t want to see how much time do you have on your hands
like are you asking that all reasonably attractive women crop out their faces so they don t get unmerited upvotes this is ridiculous lol who knew that just taking a picture of yourself as a woman means your fishing for compliments gtfoh
yeah let‚Äôs defy op and instead compliment each other u absolutelyfat i think you are a great person and deserves more hugs in your life you‚Äôre doing great so keep up the good work
this is also not a unique or original idea but it is probably something that her kids enjoy along with thousands of other teachers in the country
and she cut out part of the dress from the picture that‚Äôs she‚Äôs allegedly trying to show off
yes it s really aww i don t like kids at all but i think it s adorable that people love kids this much y all are a bunch of he man womanhaters
my first thought as well there‚Äôs so many subs that would be more fitting for this for this sub it would have been better and easier to see the drawings which is supposedly the ‚Äúaww‚Äù about this but isn‚Äôt the subject to just post a photo of the front and back of the dress laid out flat
tails can be deceiving but you can tell by her face that she is too
she clearly thinks you are an ok kind of guy i love this ‚ù§Ô∏è
i cannot upvote this enough wonderful job youve made a deserving girl and us internet trolls very happy üòÑ
i am over the moon watching this so so happy you two have that level of trust now kudos to you for taking care of her no matter how much trust she has in you that‚Äôs such a statement to your character you‚Äôre a great human
dude this is the best feeling ever worked at a pet store and my co workers dog had a similar history and she brought him one day and she was warning me to not touch but he came right up to me and let me give pets
that‚Äôs awesome enjoy your bonding time you both thoroughly deserve it
the store i work at hires several special needs employees and i always love when my schedule overlaps with theirs they re all a ton of fun to work with but there s one in particular who s pretty much everyone s favorite she never talks but she has a great sense of humor and she s always joking around with us she s also scared of men because apparently her parents worried that men would try to take advantage of her because of her disabilities i don t remember how it started but for almost a year now just about every time we see each other i ask her for a high five and she refuses and hides her have in her pockets except a couple of months ago i actually managed to get a high five from her it legitimately made my week but then the next time we saw each other she was right back to hiding her hands in her pockets another month or two later just about a month ago i d guess i got my second high five from her anyways i just wanted to say through my tangentially related rambling that i get where you re coming from it s a really great feeling isn t it you re a good person and chloe s lucky to have such a caring man in her life lt
i think dogs are more prone to being scared of men anyway i saw a study published early this week that women understand dog behavior better and dogs know this
it s super sad i had a black lab growing up and she loved people i think when she was just a couple years old we had this exterminator come by who we d had for a few years he was tall and always wore a hat lizzy was fine but after one day he was out suddenly she didn t like men and she didn t like hats we have no idea what happened or what he did to her but even guys like my grandpa or our neighbor she had seen many times before she would freak out and bark a lot and run away we did find a new exterminator after that behavior change she remained afraid of men and hats until the day she passed it was really sad because we didn t know what happened but she was such a good pupper i miss her dearly i hope she s playing with our other passed puppers up in doggy heaven
people get off on the power that being bigger and meaner than something gives them
my neighbors dog gets spooked and hides whenever she sees work boots
agreed a lady near my work has a dog that is afraid of men just a few days ago he let me pet him for the first time in the years i ve been seeing him around it made me super happy because there s guys who have known him longer that still haven t gotten to pet him i fuckin love dogs man more than people usually it sickens me to know that people can be so cruel to such wonderful animals
why is that sad people become afraid of other people too not sure what s so sad about it
my dog is a racist because his first interaction with a black person was when three people broke into my house all of them being black now he s absolutely terrified of any person with darker skin
sadly i do this with one of our dogs technically mine she is the sweetest thing but gets spooked by darn near anything and has pretty bad separation anxiety rain thunder the fridge door when it kept catching and pretty much any loud noises including my voice my voice isn t overly deep but if i get too excited or upset i ll raise my voice and it freaks her the f out she ll either run and hide or turnover on her back in fear sometimes peeing we got her when she was about a year old and we ve had her a couple of years now often wondered what the heck she went through before we got her i ve learned to almost never raise my voice out of fear of scaring her she s my lt
and animals instill fear in humans to the point many people are afraid of dogs goes both ways
yep on the bright side isn t it wonderful that humans will spend over a year patiently coaxing a scared animal because they want to befriend it
animals have good reasons to be most humans eat all of them
my cat loves men more than women dont know if its because i adobted her but prolly not she goes for my brother and dad like a fly to shit and wont sit on my cat loving moms lap i imagine its from previous experience she neber met my brother and knew i liked him when he visited she jumoed right in
could be just a lack of exposure my friend inherited his grandmother‚Äôs dog and is a caring dog owner but after years of growing up in a house with no visitors she is skittish to say the least she cowers in fear at the sight of a human who isn‚Äôt brian so sad bc i just wanna love her but it‚Äôs been almost a year or the previous owners were monsters of course
it really is my cats are afraid of men because of how badly my father treated them they‚Äôre coming around though and i‚Äôm proud of them haha
sad that people tend to consider more what history caused a dogs screwed up behavior rather than what may have warped a fellow human to act screwed up
that exterminator deserved a skull stomping and a premature funeral with in attendance she never deserved that
i don‚Äôt mean to make a blanket statement about exterminators here but seems like a job that might have some appeal if you don‚Äôt care about animals
my parents had two labs who hated our mailman so much they reassigned us a different one they switched out like four or five different mail persons until we finally realized it was the hats
just glad you noticed and you got someone new people can be such fuck heads to animals i‚Äôm glad lizzy was with a family that trusted her and made changes to accommodate her
my friend‚Äôs grandmother had a poodle that hated men in hats me putting a hat on growls me taking the hat off licks it was like a light switch lol
my dog hates when people she doesn‚Äôt know wear hats exterminator probably didn‚Äôt do anything to your dog i think it‚Äôs just common for dogs to hate hats for some reason i absolutely love dogs but they‚Äôre really dumb lol
one time i was playing with the dog of the tenant that lives in the apartment attached to my dad s garage she was really sweet and quiet i was just play chasing after her running after her stopping letting her run after me during this she had a lead that was attached to a tree so we were pretty much just running circles around the tree then as we were playing her lead got wrapped around the tree so it was suddenly much shorter and as she was running after me she went too far and got abruptly choked really badly by her lead collar now whenever she sees me even from really far away she ll start barking really aggressively i guess she associates the choking pain with me which really sucks because we were having fun before it happened and it was a pure accident i wish there was some way to say sorry
the reality is that it just needs to be scary for the animal not just scary for people so he may have done something innocuous to us but completely freaked her out my dog is terrified of all refrigerators i‚Äôve had her since weeks old and all the fridge had to do was hum that was sufficiently scary for my poor little dog to make all kitchens a no go zone the exterminator may have done something horrible or didn‚Äôt but it was enough that she decided she couldn‚Äôt trust men in general
gt it s super sad i had a black lab growing up and she loved people i think when she was just a couple years old we had this exterminator come by who we d had for a few years he was tall and always wore a hat lizzy was fine but after one day he was out suddenly she didn t like men and she didn t like hats we have no idea what happened i dunno if other people have suggested this or if you ever thought about this but it could be the chemicals he sprayed they re highly deadly to many species of animals of course and dogs heightened sense of smell may allow them to not only identify this smell as toxic and think he was therefore doing something to harm his family
my aunty put her dog into a dog hostel for a bit whilst she her family were travelling now that dog hates people who have my mother in laws haircut short blonde bob because she has the same haircut as the lady who operated the business they only realised something was wrong when were having a family party and the dog took one look at my mother in law and had a full on nam flashback and went berserk on her it sucks that one person could do something to a pet that awful that change their behaviour
sometimes dogs just get scared of objects or people doesn t have to mean he did anything to her my friend has a puppy who is now randomly afraid of men when she has never had a bad interaction with men before my own dog had a random fear of people wearing hoods out of nowhere i m not sure where that came from either
maybe she associated the toxic pesticides he was spraying with men and hats
animaniacs has been on my brain the past few days so i love that you said this my mom brought up the show the other day because she randomly got the chicken boo song in her head
you just uncovered memories i would have totally forgotten about holy shit
oh wow the top comment on this post is usually about how they gonna drop the newest album of the year
i only learned as an adult that steven spielberg produced that show which just makes it even wackier and perfect
a few minutes before was the first time i was ecstatic and wanted to catch it on camera so i moved away and sat down and started to record sure enough she came for more you guys are seeing the second time ever but a few minutes before this video was the very first thats why she seems confident i could show a video next time i see her of how scared she is i have to be seated and virtually motionless except my hand or head for her to come up
i like when people have an opinion and then there lack of grammar undermines the whole operation s
yea an animal wouldn t develop fear of men it would be fear of humans
did you notice it s a month old account with k post karma
why can‚Äôt people just shut the fuck up and be happy u whores
i agree am salty you get upvoted and i got down voted to hell tho haha
low head slower gait submissive lip licking on approach having him pet her hind quarters as opposed to head seems legit source i‚Äôve been a dog trainer for years with a cpdt ka
you re judging on a sec video what you didn t get to see was the months and weeks up to this point
everything in the entire world is fake even things that are completely plausible
because it absolutely and extremely obvious is fake this dog is getting has ass scratches like always this is not the first time he pets this dog
eh nothing wrong with giving people the benefit of the doubt every once and a while
you missed to many english lessons maybe you attended too but that is two few
at the very least this is not the first time she let me pet her
if you look closely you can tell that they‚Äôre the same pigeon it‚Äôs just a photoshop
yea this picture is pretty old first time i saw it was with a caption that said something like ‚Äúthese pigeons bout to drop the hottest album of the summer‚Äù
this photo is probably fake but chicago pigeons would approach this closely they have no fear of humans and don t give a fuck
if i could reply with an image i could show you a picture i took yesterday of a pigeon on my shoulder lmao depening on where you are in the world pigeons have no qualms literally landing in your hand on your head
plus a human head with a camera cell phone on top would probably be taller than a pidgeon
since i read about it several times now mind to tell me what a reverse search is and how it works
gt what kind of pigeons approach a human this closely depends where you live if they re anything like the pigeons where i live if they think you ve got food then you re going to get mobbed
also there s no way these pigeons are this tall human head professional camera lense this cant be
i remember seeing this being reposted tons of times none of them said this story
plus if the ceiling of the building was sharp the pigeons would be very unsharp being in this distance from the camera
alternative title camera with seeds on the lens attracts pigeon which is photoshopped twice onto a picture of a ceiling
hey if he¬¥s lying on the ground those pidgeons are like half a meter tall no reason they shouldn¬¥t approach him it¬¥s more likely the photographer is lieing on the ground
the main tell for me is that the photographer s head plus a camera would have to be at least cm these would have to be some pretty big pigeons and as near as i can tell from the angle they d have to standing inside the photographer s skull or at least pressed up against him it s not literally impossible but it stretches credulity to the breaking point
yo i was a doubter but shit i believe ya i d wanna record that too happy for you man
i actually want to see the other video of her being scared would really love to see the transition of the doggo
don t go through all that effort just to appease a cynical commenter who couldn t be arsed to type out both o s in the word too
i always judge people based on how animals react to them you are a good person
i love her smile and little glance towards you at the end like she‚Äôs saying ‚Äúwow i wish i tried this sooner ‚Äù
you don t have to prove anything to someone questioning you the point is a dog is happy
you can still see signs of stress on her face as she approaches but your pats must be that good
you have been deemed a good boy human now congratulations
do you have any tips on how to come off like a bad man
that was my first thought when i saw it haha op for sure just broke through the barrier so this is the second time otherwise he wouldn t be recording it op is a stinky liar üòÅ jks love you üòò
there‚Äôs always somebody on a thread raising the bs flag anyway it‚Äôs wonderful what you did for this dogger especially do as long you stuck to it and f amp the guy who made her frightened
my wife s dog was the same way trust me after this you ll be go to for all the pets
this was a perfect chance for hell in a cell i do believe you now though
i went to meet my grandma s new dog today and he was the sweetest boy and so cuddly later i brought my brother to meet him and he was a completely different dog he even snapped at him i hope he comes to realize we all love him he doesn t seem to trust men either
dude totally believe you that you didnt have your phone out recording every second of your life the first time something interesting happened people gonna hate the sane ones believe you super happy you made contact cheers
disagree this feels completely genuine don t spend any more time defending that chloe is the best
it‚Äôs been my job for the past years to read dog body language context is obviously important but first impression is that she‚Äôs nervous the lick lip panting facial expression but offering signs of trust by trying to stay chill with the tail wag and the loose approach a butt scratch is a good starting point and pretty soon she‚Äôll probably be requesting a good ear scratch too
yes please give us more videos of this senior pupper
aww poor little pup glad you could show her how to trust again
she looks like a grand old dame with that grey in her face good on you for teaching an old dog new pets
i am genuinely happy for you both gaining the trust of a scared animal is a beautiful thing you are both beautiful people yes i consider dogs people
well you didn‚Äôt lie you said ‚Äútoday was the first‚Äù not ‚Äúthis is the first‚Äù
good catch and yet this pic will be at the top of the sub within an hour
how can you say it s the same pigeon the pattern of the feathering on the abdomen is completely different and it would make no sense to meticulously warp brush every little one of those thousand feathers not to mention the facial perspectives are slightly different look at the beak angle it s not an exact flip it s about a degree rotational difference and that s nearly impossible to accomplish with shop unless you have a d rendering so unless the photographer took a picture of the pigeon then fucked with the orientation of his abdomen feathers then rotated him slightly and took another picture the chances are that it s two different birds looking down at a camera there is nothing to suggest that the photo isn t except maybe the lighting behind their heads could be funky but we don t have an exact source to pin it obviously the ergonomics are such that there is no human taking the picture but i don t think it s shopped at all
this just perpetuates unrealistic standard for pigeons allpigeonsarebeautiful
it s also really hard to get the background and foreground in focus like that
i checked it out at fotoforensics com but it could not tell me if fake or not but then again i am not really well versed in photo manipulation it did not come out with obvious errors but that could be due to it being recopied a buttload of times
and it would be almost impossible to get both the pidgeons and the very high ceilings focused at the same time
yeah first thing i noticed is that they seem really off
you don t even have to look closely this picture is garbage
sigh unsaved i found it kinda awesome and then saw this comment
if you look even closer you can see that the left one is a bit blurry and discolored around the edge they were both refine edge d
i m not seeing that at all anyway i m not confident that i could distinguish one individual bird of the same species from another even side by side they often do look exactly alike at least to me but even with that these don t look the same to me the angle seems slightly different i believe the photo is legit but it s not what op claims it is
i don t care i still want no need guardian pigeons not to be confused with helper doves
is she tucking them into her feathers to take back to her nest would they stay in if she flew
yep she üôÇ lovebirds are actually terrible nest builders in the wild and usually steal other birds nests
i was looking at her ‚Äúnose‚Äù and noticed definitely not male and likely going to make a nest
that is what i assumed she was doing like a natural instinct either that or she just fancy like that
weird do just females do this all the lovebirds i ve had did it
my parents have to mails and they are awful chewing these strips they try they bite anything made of paper they love destroying my parent s calendar but they hardly ever get a proper strip and even then they never ever are able to put them in their tails i guess that whatever the sex of the lovebird if you let them free from time to time you will always have to clean up little bits of paper after them
ooh cool id always kinda vaguely wondered how birds carry nest material around
i felt bad when she knocked one out she had already put in i guess they must be pretty used to that though pretty material for a nest
this makes me happy i thought she was doing it because she was insecure
thank you i used to have couple and was very curious as to why
i had a love birds and they did just that but with random sometimes important pieces if paper
but they dont do this in nature nornals birds carry sticks in their mouths
so i m curious to know what happened to her actual tail feathers
we know this and why this has been posted about a gazillion times people need to use karma decay
does attenborough know about this seems awfully clever
so in nature what is it they are cutting up in this manner i assume strips of bark
i thought she was making herself look pretty thought she was going out on the town or to a party
is this where they store them so then can fly home to build the nest them wouldn t they fall out
owner s bird excuuuuuse meh did ya just assume ma gendah
i‚Äôve got a couple of brothers and they are very very good at doing this they completely shredded my marathon bib into a beautiful pile of paper strips ‚Äô
lol i know nothing about bird law and i could that s what she was doing
i assume they normally do this with large leafs in the wild
i thought it was trying to change it sexual orientation and be showy
why aren‚Äôt males good at chewing strips like this are their beaks shaped differently than the females or is it a skill they just suck at
my sister s female lovebird did this when we were young we called her a paper shredder she didn t even attempt to tuck them away or take them anywhere though she seemed to be happy just to have a sheet of paper and turn it into strips of confetti
thanks for the explanation could not figure out why little birb thought she d look good with extensions
maybe you can answer my question on this since i want to get a bird soon aren t you supposed to deter them from doing any sort of nesting rituals because they might start laying eggs and could have egg binding
thank you for this explanation i had no idea why this cutie was doing this she is excellent at it and i find it ingenious how she packs them into her tail feather
just going to dispute the point in regards to male lovebirds not being good at this this is completely untrue it will vary on the bird source have two male lovebirds who are excellent at chewing strips in contrast the female was horrible at it
i still imagine her saying i need to look more fabulous lil bird totally has style
i find very sweet the thought of you picking up tiny paper strips left around by a clumsy lovebird
gt males are not very good at chewing strips like this that s not true my little guy makes strips like these pretty much every day he can t figure out how to stick them into his tale feathers though
how do they not fall our when she zips away into the sky
"think you for explanation
i had no idea that they transported the pieces of the nest"
i came to the comments to see if i could find out why they do this thanks for sharing lt
what materials in nature would they be doing this giant leaves or maybe littered paper
i grew up with a lovebird and it was an ongoing struggle to keep my homework intact she was the biggest sweetheart though
can confirm source being male and also bad at chewing strips
i‚Äôm gonna need a video of the stealing and tug of war stat
no worries it s not common knowledge just wanted to share
i would have guessed male too i thought he was making himself look pretty and it‚Äôs usually the males in the bird world that like to show off
you could have read it in the original post before re posting
well here s another one for you everyday is an adjective which means common or average for something that happens daily it s two words every day
like my dad used to say everyday you don t learn something new it s a day wasted
that is a very smart bird they do look like extension as they fit in her tail perfectly
maybe when you stole this post from days ago you should have read the comments
work smarter not harder now you re a billionaire but anyways sounds like penguins stealing rocks dude you go fetch it for your rock pile mine once your back is turned
imagine stealing a blue jays nest then when she lays eggs then the blue jay shows up like where s rent
instead of lovebirds they should be called homewreckers
i just saw a birds nest on the ground yesterday because it was really windy and it made me sad it was a massive nest and probably took forever to build looked like it was just ready for the mother to lay eggs in she will come back to that tree and there will be no nest
the tiny sounds that birb makes are absolutely precious
i think someone put your birbs feet on backwards hope this helps
is there a sub specifically for birds enjoying music
i can t wait to have a stable income and get an animal lt
thank you for sharing this my eyes have been blessed such an adorable birb
that a fucking cute birb what is the name of the song tho
birds share some auditory perception abilities with humans as binaural beat perception is processed in the midbrain which is a shared brainstem structure across many animal families it s an amazing thing that ties us together
if i was a dinosaur i would laugh if you demand me to build a nest lmao
wait this isn t the thread about bittersweet symphony is it
i think thats one of the cutest things ive ever seen no matter what she s doing with those extentions
i‚Äôm a firm believer that when possible a dog should always have a companion almost all labs should do well with another dog
did it a few years ago with my lab got him a friend one of the best decision of my life
do it my dog is so much happier with a friend her anxiety when we leave is so much better and she doesn‚Äôt get worked up as much by fire crackers and lightening they just seem happier together
my dogs and i want another one so bad so he has a buddy to grow old with
we adopted a pound puppy when our german shepherd was about a year and a half best decision we ever made they are best buddies five years later and still counting ‚ù§Ô∏è
our labs were brother and sister and it was one of the greatest decisions that we got two labs
do it mine are a bonded pair and absolutely love each other selfishly it helps me too to know they‚Äôve got each other when i‚Äôm not home
i want to add to the pile of comments saying that this is a good idea happy family
we got a puppy corgi for my english setter i‚Äôm not sure he likes him much most of the time due to the little fucker biting his ears all the time
we got a second dog and they almost don t even acknowledge the other one exists in fact the first dog at times gets super aggressive towards the second one sadly they re not friends barely even acquaintances
thank you for paying the pup tax your payment has been processed and appreciated
just checked your profile and your comments are so heart warming
you really need your own book or something your talent to move people is incredible
me slaps the wall fuck it ill be a monkey those bastards wished for me me to be their little puppet to fawn over well enough is enough im tired ill be a dog a monkey i be a monkey a furry white monkey with a black mustache and a tail ooh ooh ahh ahh ahhahahahahah ooh ooh
snow upon our roof is my new term for getting older
i had an old black lab named lucky with a white snout when she got old and this made me tear up at work thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
these are the rules of dog bat retrieval and they are unflinchingly ridged
yeah he should have gotten a new bat not sure if that‚Äôs against the rules though as the bat wasn‚Äôt broken
let me make a ruling here as a former player and dan for over years i agree it looked like he took a walk with no context of the pitches before hand the batsman is in the wrong here not the dog
right good girl was just trying to do her job would have given her the bat
baseball is notorious for unwritten rules this is the first one i have ever agreed with bell s bat
i love the end when his back is turned as she sneaked in ‚Äúoh i‚Äôll just take this now uh oh never mind bye‚Äù
can confirm bat on ground in a contract of ownership transfer to the retriever
that is absolutely true bat on the ground belongs to the hound
would you say that they re the unwritten rules of baseball bat retrievers
umpire should have been on top of that sorry batter once that bat hits the ground it belongs to bell
the dog is definitely trolling the ump for calling that a strike
rigid nonetheless someone just give this dog a stick or something
honestly for the sake of the dog s training he should have let her take it and gotten a new bat or retrieved that one from the dugout not giving her the bat is confusing to the dog bat on ground i get bat wait no well shit what about next time i mean have you seen dogs stand at open glass doors waiting for someone to open it i love dogs but if you put any doubt in their mind it will stick with them forever
i think you meant rigid although far more interestingly you could have meant a misspelled rigged unflinchingly rigged hehe
"its a written law with a nick nack paddy whack
give a dog a bat"
rigid unless you mean that the bats have a series of closely spaced grooves
she looks really healthy and is obviously trained no collar though i imagine someone felt they had to let her go as opposed to wanted to it s great you were there to take notice and not just walk by good work
if she was dumped why would you check for a chip because you don t know that she was dumped and you wrote that for karma op prob lying
when i was a kid on a family road trip we met a dog at a road side stop with a little park he was so sweet and showed us a stream nearby probably thinking we needed water only later did we realize someone probably left him there no left him on accident we still wish we had taken him home hope someone like you found him
good on you for making sure her original human isn t looking for her
check her belly for puppies actually the vet tech will do that no matter what when they read the chip
if you happen to be in nj and no one you know takes here let me know
the universe has chosen you and her the universe has chosen you both
left on a windowsill smh that s awful thankfully you came by when you did
i had something similar happen to me it was winter and freezing outside and when i left for work this cat tried to get into my appartment i took her inside to warm her up and feed her we tried to find her owners but no luck i ended up keeping her and she s been with me for over a year now she s crazy sweet as well
this is from a dogs purpose isn t it bawled my eyes out on this one
this is a ‚Äòquote from a kid‚Äô that i actually believe
wow silver for this copy pasta whatever if it makes people happy still see this copy pasta on literally any emotional dog related picture interestithe child s age keeps changing
not to be that guy cause it s a good quote but yeah sure i bet a six year old said that just like i solved string theory sorry again
that year old already understands why doggos are better than humans
my dog died because rottweilers have an increased risk of cancer
how come the only time i see dogs they re shouting obscenities at me then
the unstoppable marching of time that is slowly guiding us all towards an inevitable death
thats the most beautiful and pure hearted thing ive heard all day my friday just got alot better
there‚Äôs not a chance in hell i believe you heard a year old say something remotely as coherent as this
i like the expressions on their faces like they know an epic duo just formed and they ll be getting up to shenanigans in no time
i never notice op piercing had i not seen your photo well done
the first two posts i click on today have paintings drawn by you as the first comment color me impressed
great work i m curious what the sudden spark in fellow redditors arting other redditor s photos ü§î it s fun it s cool and i m curious
to me you are the equivalent of schnoodledoodledo for painting posts
do you do commissions for ‚Äúexposure‚Äù üòπü§™ lovely work just my style
came in to say the same thing that dog is not playing at all
exactly the dog is done and using every sign it can to show that
serious question what do you do to stop this my initial thought was that the cat will get bit learn its lesson and stop but what can you do to just make it stop before something happens
if the dog was so upset he would leave the area instead of just remaining there
it‚Äôs also not cool to let your cat scratch and bite your dog up either
when i play tug or play fight with my dog she is almost always baring her teeth i don t think that s an automatic sign of aggression especially when play fighting
baring of teeth alone isn t a sign of aggression doggy has relaxed ears isn t trying to escape or move and only shows his teeth when he counters the kitty dog might not be having a blast but this isn t a dangerous situation imo
i have to disagree dog is showing teeth like he would do to warn other fellow canin of course kitten doesn t get it but he seems too relaxed and too defensive to intentionally hurt the kitten the first sign of pain and that cat would have already stop
i agree to having to be careful large and smaller pets can get along and play just fine however i do want to point out that accidents do happen when you have pets that are of significant difference in size this happened to my pets twice there were no aggression in either case but pure accidents due to one being much smaller my lab and my chihuahua mix was hanging out under a table they were rough playing and lab must have bump hit their face and mouth together my little dog‚Äôs eye globe popped out and she also had a couple of broken bottom teeth the other accidents was with another lab and a little mix breed puppy they were both running to greet my daughter at the front door they ran into each other puppy was flipped into the air and landed very hard in a bad angle it almost broke his neck in both cases after some huge vet bills both little dogs were luckily ok but i have to be careful they don‚Äôt get too rough in play
thats as angry as i have ever seen a golden get granted i never owned one but im always impressed by there gentleness
absolutely right these replies disagreeing with you are wrong that dog may just be meeting that cat after a few interactions dog may decide cat is okay or may escalate and destroy kitty source am veterinarian
you ve never had cats and dogs at the same time have you they play like this all the time
i see a lot of posts about the dog play fighting with the cat this isn t exactly that this is an adult dog teaching a young one the law of the land dogs don t care if the young one is a cat a dog or a seal my only hope is the cat understands dog language enough to learn from this that this is the kind of behaviour that s not okay the alternative is typically an adult cat getting his head chomped clean off later on
my goldens play like this all the time he s sitting there chill af
if you notice how the dog doesn‚Äôt actually nip at the cat you‚Äôll know he‚Äôs not being aggressive he‚Äôs most likely trying to teach the cat boundaries amp the cat keeps failing because it‚Äôs a baby there are several other tells that dogs are aggressive but this one shows no other sins if he really wanted to take that kitty down he would do it immediately
this is my dog and cat and i can assure you they are playing i get how a second clip on the internet might make you gather certain assumptions but you are inccorect my dog is absolutely playing and has exhibited the same tendencies with myself my wife and my child i ve known him for years and i know his cures all dogs are unique and you can t place blanket statements on them
while the potential for injury is there because of the huge size difference that dog is definitely restrained playing the dogs actions in this case are completely appropriate dogs play with their mouths if they don‚Äôt curl their lip the lips would be damaged a lot when playing there is zero indication of aggression or agitation the dog is actually actively trying to appear smaller if it was agitated at all it would stand up unless it is disabled in some way
that s what animal shelters are for you surrender the animal to a facility that can properly care for them and will work to find a new home for them
go through a long arduous process of finding a new loving home for your friend hopefully even having a chance to let them get to know each other before you have to leave for good
take it to a shelter they ll usually ask basic questions like name age health history vaccinations and that s it they dont want to make it awkward they just want what s best for everyone
you can surrender them to a shelter ideally a no kill shelter as many dogs don‚Äôt make it out of kill shelters especially pits chihuahuas and lots of black dogs you can also attempt to rehome them yourself but i would recommend doing a background check and requiring a rehoming fee to be sure that the person actually wants the dog and that it isn‚Äôt going to end up a bait dog
i faced that situation once had to give up my cat missy fortunately for me i have sisters they had an argument as who was going to take missy both wanted her missy went to my youngest sister who spoiled her rotten when my situation got better my sister refused to give missy back i m happy to report that missy spend the rest of her days as a well loved and pampered member of my sisters family family can really help you out if you get in a bind even if they are a royal pain in the ass at times
had to give up a newfie puppy that came to us because others were irresponsible we reached out to the local rescue organization and had her rehomed it sucked and i hated it but there wasn t any other option she didn t spend a single night in a rescue shelter it took days and a hour trip out of state
when i took on a dog and shortly afterwards hit a rough patch in my younger years it was fairly easy to ask friends and then friends of friends when friends couldn t take on a pup this was in the mid s though and actually happened twice didn t learn the first time once was the sweetest collie girl named chance and the second one was a male black lab pup chance went to a female lawyer whose looks were as soft as the collie and the lab went to a gentleman farmer with lots of land family members vouched for both people
i d start with putting out a call to friends friends of friends to see if anyone i knew could take in my pupper so i d still be able to see her if that did not work i d find the nicest shelter obviously no kill within driving distance and take her there while bawling my eyes out
situations i can think of are all dangerous like if the pup was stolen or if their original owner was in an abusive relationship and their partner either took the dog to abandon them or forced them to abandon the dog themselves idk what the chances of that is but i can happen
i moved countries and couldn t initially find a house that would allow me to bring my cat s for now he is being taken care of by someone else and i pay for his food and other bills my parents also offered to take care of him i m planning on getting him back in a few months i d never surrender a pet without the clear intention of creating the conditions in the near future usually there s usually someone who wouldn t mind fostering well behaved animals if their expenses are taken care of
find a trustworthy friend willing to adopt or a no kill shelter
i second what people said about shelters there are also good websites for listing pets available for adoption if you have the time to keep the dog with you while you look for a new human for them
i found a new owner who had breed knowledge and a lot of room for my dog hardest thing i ever did
your on a roll today just saw your cute painting of the girl and her pup you did
i ve gotten sorta sick and suspicious of karma farmers jumping in and making low effort paintings but this is really good sweet and wholesome totally captures the aww in this photo

its actually happening to all the moving elements in the image but the black and gunmetal colors of the rubber and chain are harder to see against the brown background
the gif froze up for me and wouldn t work again while i was reading this comment i think you re onto something
i don t seem them but that s because i m protected by alex jones vitamins

we had a cat named dodger who came from the same roots brings back memories
or the first words of off her mouth shebang she almost hit it oshi t
i think it s still early enough to swap that s a perfect name
clearly this dog gives you an excellent recommendation
if pixar made a movie about a dog therapist that is him
you always had to pat his fluff give good scritches walkies and pat his bottom didn‚Äôt care if he pooped you just cleaned it up as he wagged his tail no you didn‚Äôt have to feed him snacks have your workmates make sure there was water i guess you got a better job now he‚Äôs just some doggie that you used to know some doggooooooo
"edit wow edit i didn t got gold
edit thank you unkind associates"
peasants are those make edits and nd edits for thanking stupid awards on reddit
why do gold award speeches always sound exactly the same ‚Äúkind stranger‚Äù and all
my mums ex boyfriend taught gotye how to play the guitar that is so crazy to see him being talked about on reddit oh my god amazing
i can give you a pat of the head and a doggie treat
missed the chance to say ‚Äúsome doggy‚Äù which would have been closer to ‚Äúsomebody‚Äù either way i got a giggle out of it
they made silver a real thing lol that seems like it defeats the purpose
great there goes the rest of my day pulls up gotye on spotify
an absolute mutt i d say this was greece where a lot of street dogs do a lot of street dog things so it s impossible to say but he does have an owner he s also not dissimilar to my two who are half miniature collie if that helps
my dog also looks like this and he is a border collie labrador mix
check out finnish lapphounds they often look like this
my dog looked just like this too he came from a shelter in georgia never knew quite what he was but had lots of guesses the best most sweetest and loyal dog i ever knew i miss him like hell
looks like an alaskan malamute labrador retriever mix
look into a finnish lapphund they look exactly like this
just from the face and the way it grabs his hand i can tell you there s some finnish laphound in there my brother s dogs do the same thing where they grab around yiur hand and stand on their hind legs
my brother s dog looks just like this and she s a cross between a german shepherd and a malamute
username checks out also are you subscribed to cat facts lol
i want a dose of what you re taking some insightfully strange facts being warped into an hilarious imaginative conclusion thumbs up my fellow space crusader
ok now i can t tell if any of that was real a lot of it sounds believable
that went from aww to awe to aw fuck to aaaa right whatever in less than a minute quite aaaaaa ride though
i wanna look this up to see if you re lying but i dunno what the fuck to search
i want to read that novel you should write that novel
‚Äú is something that everyone thinks was invented by the internet‚Äù wait i never thought that
what kind of freaking nonsense is oh that guy enjoy the upvote s
i read on believing until i felt stupid in the end thanks
gt they gather still to this day as giant hundreds feet high walking forests with a cat at the base of each tree lol
hehe good one little fella turn turn the camera off
i asked him if he liked catch so i told him to catch these hands
godamit i was drinking water when i read this never spit something out so fast
i dont think this is taking place in florida where laying out a year old would be acceptable if i feared for ma lyfe
i m laughing trying to image him telling that with his australian accent like steve irwin
would it be possible for a hobbyist to create something like this using conventional leds
excellent explanation so the pup is getting a few drops of water but is confused by what it sees
i thought the wheel caps effect worked only on video not in real life maybe anecdotal but i have never seen it happen with my own eyes except on a screen
so does the dog see what we see or can he see the water falling normally
i thought it was way less then way more complicated at first i thought it was just bubbles rising in a tube then i saw the dog lick it and make a splash after which i thought about it too much and figured it was some sort of laminar flow with air bubbles fighting their way up through the falling stream of water
is this like how we perceive a propeller or helicopter blades when operating
but dogs see at different framerates so how does it work
is this also why when an airplane propeller starts spinning fast it looks like it goes backwards
if our eyes have a fps ‚Äúrefresh rate‚Äù how can i tell the difference between and fps
oh that s so cool thanks for the explanation i was as confused as the dog
i hear that getting a dog and walk i g it regularly significantly increases the chances of getting a girlfriend go for it
first you get the dog then you creepily wait outside of the girl who you ve been crushing on s workplace until she gets off after hours to show off said dog because at the time you don t realize you re being super creepy then you date the girl for a while because she overlooks your creepiness and then you both get married and live happily ever after or something like that that i have absolutely no firsthand experience in whatsover
not recommended they will like each other more than they will like you i miss my dog
i have a dog and a fianc√©e i wish i had that hair getting old sucks
that s his wife so he doesn t have a girlfriend either
i wish i have a girlfriend too all that i have is a fiance
i ve always heard one for flinching two for bitching
is this an atlantis reference or was it a thing before that
i thought your loony dad burned your ear off on the stove
i m allergic to dogs and apparently women are allergic to me
pro tip if your dog is fearsome enough you can scare someone into being your girlfriend
that s easier said than done you have to put a lot of money and effort into supplies like food and leashes remembering to refill and clean the water and food dishes every day worry about being bitten until you finish the obedience training program the resist the constant crying and begging to be let outside the dog is a lot of work too
love it amp nbsp now we need the dog to make a drawing of you drawing him drawing his own name
ah are you the same guy who produced the watercolor portrait of the guy in the red shirt with his great dane a few months ago do you have a sight or imgur with your entire collection
why is it nsfw too cute that it might get you heartstroke at work

the average year old in a place like this more mature than the average year old in north america
when you grow up in a rd world country there s less time for being a kid

now i want to see them both kiss once even a damp or a slight land
fucking love him his character was so good in chappie i hated him irl for like weeks until i saw him do something crazy charitable than i was like ah i can t not love this guy
always heard good things but my favorite hugh story comes from my old boss and another coworker who ran into him on the street my boss can get quite hype at times so when he approached hugh he was like ‚Äúyo man can i get a photo ‚Äù and hugh had apparently responded with a simple ‚Äúnahh‚Äù and kept moving the thought of that always made me chuckle
ya know hugh is eh he s okay me personally i ve always enjoyed his lesser known half step brother huge assman now that guy is a real class act üëç
this comment is on basically every post about either of them
i can‚Äôt wait to go to jackman‚Äôs concert later next month has an outstanding year run as the wolverine with an even better final outing then plays in one of the only musicals i actually cared about les miserables and the greatest showman i am totally straight yet i can‚Äôt deny he is definitely an admirable dude i just love how charismatic and fun huge jackedman is with all his ventures truly deserves praise after delivering his all with is performances
i happen to love sir ian mckellan spelling let him join in he can play anything if the script is excellent
of course with a special guest appearance from tom hanks
and bill murray i love that guy and he looks like a nice guy
considering how this kid intimidated wolverine he might just be the one to finish off john wick
when i was younger maybe junior high i got roped into watching my month old niece while my sister got her hair done so when there i am sitting in the waiting area of a hair salon with my niece and who walks in but keanu reeves i was nervous as fuck and just kept looking at him as he read a magazine and waited but didn t know what to say pretty soon though my niece started crying and i m trying to quiet her down because i didn t want her to bother keanu but she wouldn t stop pretty soon he gets up and walks over he started running his hands through her hair and asking what was wrong i replied that she was probably hungry or something so keanu put down his magazine picked up my niece and lifted his shirt he breast fed her right there in the middle of a hair salon chill guy really nice about it
gt can keanu tag along only if cosby is released early and allowed to join
you need an odd number of nice people or it cancels out and they start wrecking up the place it s how ms started
and a halloween special to communicate with bob ross mr rodgers and steve irwin with a seance
and stallone dude paid for a dog he sold for he couldn t afford to feed it this was before he was famous and also the turtles he buys in rocky are really his and still alive today
mr rogers steve irwin and bob ross would like a word
i feel like somehow bill murray has been left out of this cohort of awesomeness
‚Äúwe‚Äôre the four best friends that anyone can have ‚Äù
y all are aware of some of the accusations against these very people right
and mr roger s bob ross and martin luther king jr are the force ghosts watching them
why only guys what about some wholesome gals just interested that it s only guys that seem to fall into this category it s kinda weird
but we can still adopt dogs so one out of two ain t bad
gt well i ll never be this happy gt well i‚Äôll never be this good looking probably related
find this person and cut off their face to wear over your face
dogs don t judge your looks sounds like you need two dogs then you can be even happier than this guy
if i am not wrong it is an suckerfish it i has genetic relations with the shark family so i would understand the confusion of the person who posted this
yeah it s got this cool little suction cup head they are usually found stuck to the bottom of great whites
yes also you know it has eaten scraps left by sharks and also the sharks poop
correct it is a shark accessory one shark walked up to me he had a lot of remoras he s like hey man you got a lot of nerve and i m like yeah well you have a lot of shark accessories you all are a smart crowd i played a dumb crowd once and had to say yeah well you have a lot of fish on your head
are they parasitic i figured once they found a shark to latch to they didn t ever come off it to find another do they cause any harm to sharks over time
on a scale of to mystic how much mana do i have to pay for this remora
yep when i was diving i had a remora come up to me when i was looking away and he went chomp chomp on my fingers then swam away super quick it was actually adorable until he came back more times trying to pull the same move
they also mimic another fish but i cant think of the name off the top of my head
give her chin scritches and smooches for me if she lets you lol also i wanna know where did you buy your cushion covers from
oh my god i need to snuggle that baby until it claws up my shoulder to get away from me
it looks soooo confused toni mew mew what is this hooman doing with that thing on my face
toni went from fluffy rabbit to cute kitten real quick
ahh toby looks just like one of the kittens in fostering my so are considering adopting him but we already have a cat i think you just convinced me to do it
toni oh my god men‚Äôs name here and have a friend by that name haha
i‚Äôd have her entire head inside my mouth with her spinning around wondering who turned the lights off and why it‚Äôs suddenly humid and stinky
my cat has pooped on my pillow while looking me in the eye because i wouldn‚Äôt let her outside after dinner
my cat goes specifically to my room to be sick won‚Äôt go in there to cuddle or for anything else
i had an iguana when i was that escaped nights in a row before we made a cage with a latch i slept on my side idk if it climbed over me or what but it always shit on my bed behind me so if my parents didn t stop me i would roll over in it then she would go on top of the livingroom curtains and chill til we got her
my cat looks out the window amp cries until i get home
my dog takes one of my sock to cuddle with when i am at work then eats it
mine does this whenever im gone for days we have people pop in and feed and such during this time when i get home pee will pee either on my bed my suitcase or a piece of clothing on the ground he also loves to sleep in my post gym clothes he is quite gross but loves me i guess
my cat pees on my clothes in my laundry bin while i m at work it s just like the dog in the gif so wholesome s
maybe take him to a vet cats aren t supposed to pee outside of the litterbox on a regular basis like that he might be sick
older stray regardless just give them time and love might come around might stay an ass cat
most of these cases turn out to be trust issues deciding to pet her in her anxious state is basically just the human being needy however good your intentions might be and her cutting you is not a strange reaction from that perspective kittens are cute and we expect them to be cuddly but especially with her being a stray and thus not knowing her past experiences this ideal situation could potentially take a lot of time and patience to develop if it ever does leave her be learn and listen to her worry signs and respect personal boundaries to restore her trust it s ok if she s gonna be in that box for a while in time she ll come to you
it takes time to earn a cats trust all the cats i‚Äôve ever had were strays my new cat donut jr took months to warm up to me after momma donut had him in my backyard it started small him completely avoiding me and waiting in the shadows while i filled up the food bowl outside then as time went on he would make himself visible but keep his distance slowly he got closer and closer as time went on and he got older i was then able to extend my hand outside of the back door and he would approach sniff it and i would sneak a pet or two in sometimes he accepted it sometimes he didn‚Äôt then one day as i left the back door open cuz i was cleaning the water bowl he walks in and begins to explore the house he was so fascinated by the smells i think and the colors and decor maybe even the cooler temperature as well i followed him around as he did so and i think he got lost cuz he was meowing while looking around and so i had to convince him to follow me back which my version of convincing is literally me talking to him saying ‚Äúc‚Äômon the outside is this way ‚Äù it took a bit but he eventually followed me back and he ran out the door it wasn‚Äôt long till he was rubbing himself on my hand and then rubbing himself on my legs and now i can pick him up cuddle him and all that other fun stuff it just took time momma donut still won‚Äôt get close to me though
she may be scared and needs time to trust people try association techniques like petting when you give her wet food my cat came as a feral baby and took months to make her trust me if it is an older cat it can take even longer
i was just going to write something like ‚Äúi wonder if strays that get picked up like the one in the one in the video ever understand how lucky they are ‚Äù found an answer no
i m no cat expert but i have had a cat that has acted like this not towards me but towards everybody else so i ll bite and give you my cents amp x b i had a cat named max for almost years we also brought along his brother midnight midnight was sweet and really curious about people but still kept his wits about him from kittenhood he d go up to people sniff them kind of back away and go about his business if someone didn t smell right or seemed off i didn t bring too many people he thought were untrustworthy home during his life though as he always seemed to be up for brushing up against legs and headbutts of affection for damn near everyone i brought into the house amp x b max was different he d play and love on his brother and he was really affectionate with me but anytime someone invaded what he perceived as his personal space hisses and swipes all the hisses and swipes he d often go hide when i brought friends and family over and just generally be a paranoid fuck he never got over it and he lived to be damn near every time someone new or someone who d been around him his whole life like my mom got close enough to him hisses and fucking swipes only time he d tolerate being around my mom or anyone else was when he was hungry and needed a bite to eat or needed to take a shit and they were in the same room amp x b max and his brother midnight or middie as we all called him died years ago now and when we had to put max down i had my mom go outside she was too upset even more upset than when middie had passed because for years max hadn t let her pet him and on the final day of his life he was too fucked up and far gone to care and my mom was finally able to pet him and tell him she loved him and would miss him and appreciated him being a good friend to me even if he was an asshole to her and everyone else but me and his brother amp x b i ve gotten far off track but i needed to get that out point being i m no cat expert but some cats just aren t going to trust you unless you re their person i don t know what it takes to gain that level of trust from a cat but in my experience some cats are going to gel with you and love you and others are going to fucking hate you no matter what
i recommend getting her nails trimmed at a vet or anywhere my stray kitty loves tearing up human flesh even after she gets used to you but now that her nails aren t razor sharp anymore i can play with her and not wonder if she s going to sever anything important
give him a bath go to a vet and castrate bath is important because make him get your home smell cats are familiar with smell if you have the same smell as him he tends to like you
yeah people don‚Äôt really realize how much bonding takes place because the animal is so young adopting an adult is a much or difficult task if you want to get them to actually like you i hope your cat comes around one day but regardless i‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs much happier even if it‚Äôs not showing it
feral cats often can t be rehabilitated because they re basically wild animals that s why many animal shelters catch and neuter strays then release them again it s often better for them because they re not stressed in a new environment
i took in a stray from the humane society she was found wandering a golf course ears torn up from spats with the local stray population and maybe a few raccoons she was a friendly cat but wouldn t let you pick her up and you could only pet her if you were sitting on the couch i was just too big when i was standing up i guess and she lived the rest of her life ravenously hungry on the one hand it made her easy to manipulate because a bag of treats was never ignored but on the other hand she would sit and stare at you from about feet away waiting for the next morsel of food to satisfy her starving existence you couldn t let her in the bedroom because she would keep you awake all night desperately hoping you would get up and give her more food and eventually i needed to lock her away at night or she d simply meow and claw at the door all night amp x b the moral of the story is that even a good stray can be a handful some of their bad habits are simply never unlearned
don t force the contact if she has a space she feels safe and stays frequently then feed her there and leave some clothes or towels that smell like you with her she ll come around my house panther didn t sit in a human s lap for over a year and it probably took about before i could just walk up and pet him like everyone else is saying just love and patience she ll come around
i read some articles about how to fix this a while ago they basically involved wrapping the car up like a burrito so it can‚Äôt claw you and feeding it by hand and not giving it food any other way and petting it so it slowly learns that you are a source of good things and your hands are not dangerous and also a source of good things maybe look the articles up and give it a try might not work but could improve both of your lives
our second cat was a bit of a stray he was born under a house with very limited human contact he didn t trust us at all at the beginning and snarled and scratched anyone who would come close further into that process i feel that sleeping where the cat can see you helps to build trust i don t know if that is actually good advice but i feel it speed things along with our case
yeah when you get chosen just take the number to the desk give your details and credit card then go shopping for luxury cat food and cat toys
yeah some humane societies will give an animal out to literally anyone
i was surprised with how quick and easy it was too but then realized that they really need homes for these animals and want to get them into your hands without hassle
i was gonna say but that long story isn‚Äôt that long all it takes is a look and a meep
i would say you are the winner look at that sweet little smile what are their names
and about minutes for our cat we‚Äôd heard that we would need to provide proof of ownership of our house or a letter from an apartment complex homeowner that pets were allowed but it never came up
i think your wife knew damn well what the process was and wanted you to fall in love with kitties
you were smart to get two kittens if you did not already have a cat they develop better as a pair
yep you give money they check background they give cat you take cat you and cat are happy cat gets acquainted cat becomes boss cat starts peeing anymore boss approves you clean pee you accept pee suddenly people comment on pee smell you no longer accept pee cat continues to pee maybe you have a roommate who is disgruntled by pee pee is no longer acceptable attempts at mitigating pee issue pee issue worsens power struggle between you and cat you reluctantly take back the boss title but boss crown is already marked you smell like pee you are angry cat is now enemy despite multiple treaties early morning raid to topple cat and lock him up in carrier car all warmed up cat in carrier in back seat arrive at humane society you are shamed from bringing cat back cat return process easy too
it really is a simple step process why is my truck meowing open hood congrats you now have an engine compartment kitten or that s how i got my last cats on the same morning
love them both the guy on the right has a lovely smile enjoy them üëçüèª
when we got our cats they checked references took a week before we could take our cats home
mike looks like hes happy to have a new family tucker looks like the weary older brother that hasnt quite come around yet sitcom gold
this definitely went according to plan for her üòÇ you were bamboozled friend
you fell for the the just looking scam fell for it too and ended up with a lab dane mix she was the best puppy ever
look at their cute happy face they are beautiful babies üòªüòª
the smug look of the lil one on the right d made my day thanks
just to see what the adoption process is like my friend your wife had walked in there with the plan to take a cat home i absolutely will be using this excuse one day
don t want to be that guy but your wife knew exactly what she was doing and you just fell into her trap congrats man those guys look real fun and you are in for a world of happies kitties are the best and they suck you into their madness but they can also kinda ru you wild a amp crazy most of the time just remember they are not human but their own kind of weird being whatever that is they love you you love them and then they hate you then two minutes later they love you again they are sh t they are awesome be patient with them and they will mostly be patient with you if they piss all over the place because they have an issue with each other may god or whatever entity you believe or do not believe in be with you those little shit stains are a holes they suck so much but they are also a source of so much happiness and friendliness that it made buying a carpet cleaning vacuum and using it twice a week to deal with their awful spraying behaviour we both had our own kitties before we met each other we truly love each other but the kitties badicaly decided to hate each other from the day they met and years later they are still nowhere near what would consider to be friends they at best tolerate each other it is still still absolutely worth it and would never give any of it up i accept that the crappy parts are just the cost of all the happy parts and there are more happy parts than crappy parts overall and it makes it all worth it
i would be in trouble if i went there actually there was a job opening at one a little while back and i considered it i decided against it because i‚Äôd end up wanting to take all of them home your kitties are certainly very cute
do you have a box and yes congratulations you now own a cat
my wife found out her place of employment offers reimbursement up to a certain dollar amount for pet adoption not sure if this is through healthcare or just a benefit it is reimbursable because of mental health and pets are definitely prescribed just throwing that out there in case anyone could possibly get some extra cash back to spoil their fur babies with
i m guessing that she might ve known that before she got you in there üòâ
no one ever goes into a pet store or a humane society to check things out it always ends the same way you got some really cute ones
next week the wife convinces you pegging is normal you took the wrong path here and now you are a speedbump to her happiness and she will manipulate you in times she needs to bend you
what s the adoption process like i ve been thinking of getting a pet but idk
not for me there s so many procedures that i went out to find a reputable dog breeder and now happy they require so much information such as employment finances home apartment marital status health amp mental state wtf children home apartment life required a house visit first the whole process takes an entire month
as opposed to the insane processes the rescue cat ladies prefer
one thing i would fully recommend is to go ahead and get them used to their cat kennels leave the crates out with a blanket in them so that when it comes time for a trip to the vet wherever you don‚Äôt have to break out the oven mitts to avoid paying a blood tax also the more ‚Äústrange people‚Äù you introduce the kittens to while they‚Äôre young the more friendly and social they‚Äôll be as adults i did this stuff with my two cats and as adults they love people and love to travel completely non catlike behavior
play with their paws now to get them used to it it will help with the later years
i left for two days and my cat peanut had a kind of elastic collar when i came back he had gotten the collar stuck in his mouth and it rubbed his little cheeks raw my cat doesn‚Äôt ever leave the house so he no longer wears collars after that incident
please have a look at the mechanism of the breakaway collar the way he is wearing it right now the collar will not effectively break away but will remain around his fluffy neck
or get a breakaway collar they still have the bell but you know they won‚Äôt get stuck
they can also get their tongue stuck on under it and then suffocate
if it s a breakaway collar it s all right always try and use a breakaway collar so if your cat does get caught on something he can pull it apart
one time my brother went to check on our dogs who were in their ‚Äúroom‚Äù laundry room with a baby gate and one of their legs somehow slipped behind the collar of the other one and she was being choked lucky my brother just had a thought to check on them he said my dog the one being choked look like her eyes were gonna pop out of her head we tightened up the collars after that
also play with and touch their paws take nail clippers and just make the noise next to it when it comes time to trim nails the sound won t freak them out
when he get heavier you can buy those collars that snap if he gets stuck somewhere my cat has losy a dosen of them in a nearby forest lol but he has always been fine
shhhh ‚Äújust to look‚Äù is a sacred and ancient spouse spell used to acquire extra creatures
don‚Äôt give our secret away i too went to ‚Äúlook‚Äù with my husband who didn‚Äôt want another cat we now have cats
my friend drove me to the shelter to pick up the cat i d adopted in the ten minutes it took me to talk to the vet and pop the cat in her carrier he had spotted a dog and started filling out the paperwork absolutely lethal
yeah after our cat of fourteen years passed away i wanted a new pet not a replacement by any means i just felt incredibly lonely without a pet finally convinced my mum because i live with her to go and ‚Äúlook‚Äù she fell in love with a kitten at first sight and we reserved him then and there the next day we rang up to reserve his brother now they‚Äôre nearly three years old and i still remind her when they‚Äôre naughty that i accepted her offer to go and look she‚Äôs the one who decided instantly
yeah i dont think his wife was planning on just having a look üòÇ
brought my roommate to look once turns out there was an month old cat with the exact coloring and disposition of his childhood bff there were man tears involved yes
confirmed went to a shelter to look and left with two kittens we ve had these fat fluffs for years now
yep when my gf adopted a kitten she brought me out to see the others from the same litter it was impossible to not want one of those little monsters now we each have one
confirmed i went to ‚Äúlook‚Äù and i‚Äôve had my kitty for almost a year now
wrong they do just go into just look you just dont ever leave without an animals thats what makes it funny and cute
exactly my girlfriend and i went in to look a year and a few months later our puppy is pushing me out of the bed at night
i ve gone in for a look a few times although never with a so that creates the necessary safe space
right i feel bad but i have to avoid adoption events because i almost left with a dog last time i just dont have the time plus a tiny apartment with two cats it wouldn‚Äôt be fair
when i was in high school a neighbors cat had kittens and i convinced my parents to let me have one for the weekend to play with and i‚Äôd take her back monday but just let me play for two days haha boo became ours sadly she lived a very short life and was hit by a car shortly thereafter before people get nasty she snuck out when we left and we didn‚Äôt know everyone was heartbroken
i went in with a friend once just to look and fell in love with the a saint bernard named arya unfortunately my apartment said no because of weight limits
this is so damn sweet it made me tear up i love this ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
my heart is exploding this needs to be posted on shelter doors
i think this perfectly sums up the thoughts of that little smirking fellow with the dangly collar
nice poem but these kittens need to pay attention in english class
love your poems the rythym timing syllable emphasis are so tight and perfect it‚Äôs like a laminar flow of words whether achieved through gift or grind i appreciate your sharing them
you broke me going to go get a kleenex and snuggle my furbabies
i don‚Äôt know if you did this intentionally but this poem reads perfectly to the tune of the fresh prince of bel air theme song
this made me tear up so sweet thanks for sharing üòøüíï
i m going to guess cervical disc herniation compression that was corrected by surgery and the dog gradually recovered its motorneuron function over time
go to the original post all the links to the story there
i‚Äôm glad this little dog got the help he needed as a college student i worked at a dog grooming shop dog boarding business there was a man that would drop off his dog every monday and wouldn‚Äôt pick him up until sunday then board him again on monday so the dog was never home and the man never spent time with him the dog was incapable of using his hind legs so we would have to use a towel to lift him up to walk around the man was so tired of dealing with him that he would just leave him at our boarding place so that he didn‚Äôt have to care for him when i would show up on the weekends to do my shift i would do a couple of therapy exercises in hopes he would be able to use his legs again after months and months of working with him he started to slowly use his legs little by little everyone was in shock i don‚Äôt think that the dog was incapable of improving it was the owner who didn‚Äôt give him a chance to improve
crap crap mega crap i‚Äôll give you bucks for all of them
obviously dog‚Äôs owners gave it a vaccination and this is what happened not shown in the video when a vet tech held a potato at the injection area and sucked out all the poison and the dog could miraculously walk again potato power
jesus christ nerd i m just kidding i take it you re a doctor or a veterinarian
i think i saw something like this with a cat on vetranch it may have been an infection but the symptoms seemed similar amazing recovery for both of them medical science is quite amazing
ask and ye shall receive and as someone who works with so many wonderful vets and vet nurses allow me to express my gratitude enjoy your gold shiny and many thanks
my friends dog had something like this i think the dog slowly lost the ability to use his back legs or something cause of it he couldnt control his bladder either but still liked to run around he would piss in circles around their kitchen island anyway years or so later he just started walking again
that was my guess too between us there s a lot of vet experience and degrees i bet
clearly this adorable dog is going through physical therapy but i also can t help but see the dog as intentionally being limp out of laziness easy to laugh when you know the dog is fine in the end lt
my friend currently has a dog working through disc herniation and she hasn‚Äôt needed surgery all of her progress has been through hydro therapy and a lot of physical therapy she‚Äôs currently walking again still stumbles and falls but she‚Äôs been fighting through it
my chihuaha had a herniated disk that they had to replace jelly in the disk cost me k and he didnt need any physical therapy i can only imagine how much this cost
sounds legit anytime motorneuron function is mentioned i think ‚Äúthat person went to college‚Äù
was my guess too our dog had to have surgery to remove a discal cyst last year and this looks just like what he was like i had to cut back to part time at work just to care for him while he recovered that treadmill would have been so helpful lol it s been almost months now and he is finally finished with physical therapy and is back to normal this video is so sweet but no one tells you about having to stand outside in all kinds of horrible weather holding your dog up in a standing position waiting til he is finally able to poop or when he s able to stand on his own he just loses his balance and summersults backwards mid poop i ve never laugh cried so much in my life the poor little dude üòÇ
lol i like that i ve seen you with two top comments on two separate adorable pup posts
you may never know this but i love you with my soul
gt a simple poem if you can find something that s simple for you and brings happiness to many that s ultimate success and lifegoals all rolled into one
i ve never read any poem like yours they flow seamlessly together and touch the core of my heart you really are unique like in billion unique please know that every time i read one of your poems it is always an extra special treat that connects me to the relevant post also love the spelling and baby talk of the animals much appreciation from trinidad
i love your poems so much they never fail to make me cry thank you for them
thank you schnoodle you are a true gift to us all üòª
that s incredible i m glad to troll is back to running and being his old self
i kinda wanna hear you rubbed it in the neurologist‚Äôs face lol
gt when my previous vet severed my dogs spine holy crap how incompetent does a vet have to be to manage that please tell me they lost their vet license for that or that you filed a lawsuit that will hopefully result in same yeah i know justice doesn‚Äôt often happened in real life but i can hope
you re gonna have to break down how the shit a vet severs a spine by what sounds like accident in a bit more detail how in the fuck
can i ask how much you spent was it covered by the vet who did it
i think there are still too many clinicians that underestimate the value of physical therapy both veterinary and human i‚Äôve been lucky that i‚Äôve worked at a few practices where all of our neuro and ortho cases got referred to rehab but we had the facilities at our hospital my current hospital does not have rehab and we do so many orthopedic surgeries and have so many animals that would benefit from going to physical therapy but i seem to be the only one that brings it up and being a tech not a doctor i have zero control of the post op recommendations üòû
omg that‚Äôs horrible it reminds me of when i took my himalayan cat to the vet for a haircut and they fucking killed him they anesthetized him without a signed consent and overdosed him on the anesthetic they left the room to get his vaccinations and came back and he had stopped breathing when i went to pick him up they gave me his dead body in a cardboard box with their apologies of course
i need their secret my mom‚Äôs dog is able to regain strength in her hind legs but my mom doesn‚Äôt have time to help her so i would like to but i legitimately wonder if i just need to hold her through baby steps
we had this experience at a shelter as well though not at all they acted like we weren‚Äôt good enough to take home a doggie
huh i ve never had to do all that before are adoptable pets in high demand where you live
yeah our shelter wasn t giving cats to people with kids or who don t have a freestanding home with a garden so we just got a stray kitten that kinda lived in the shelter of my parents friendsüòï it was sad not to help the shelter cats some have been there for years living in these teeny tiny lots üòï i don t get how that s better than a flat
same here and if you or a family member ever let a cat go outside they check vet records of not only your cats but your family s cats they won t adopt a cat to you because you might be persuaded to let that cat out too they are really strict here too and they re even worse about dogs
when adopting my cats they wanted a walk through we did a video walk through that was enough there was also a short interview when my in laws were adopting a kitten they only really wanted to see the lease to make sure pets are allowed
i tried to get a boxer from a boxer rescue they wouldn t approve me because my yard doesn t have a fence i live on acres with a driveway that s over feet long away from the only road in my town we have boxer mixes and a little terrier mix now the spca is more understanding i guess
i ve found it depends on the shelter the largest shelter and the animal control center in our area both ask for an application and will call your landlord if you re renting but don t ask for other references they do good work but they are both always at or very near capacity and need to make space the private shelter in a small city near us where i adopted our dog from made it much more difficult for us they asked for three references and had to be able to reach all of them before i could take the dog home they grilled all of the people i listed for references on the type of pet owner i am whether i was adopting our dog just for the puppy stage which made very little sense as he was already two anyway etc ironically it was this private shelter that also did not realize or check that the dog they were adopting out had ehrlichiosis poor bub was constantly sick for about six months until the vet finally diagnosed what the true problem was
i ve seen rescues that do this because the animals are in foster homes so they aren t super in a rush to get the animals into homes but most shelters i know of are a lot more relaxed sorry to hear that you have been given the run around when we adopted our two little monsters i just walked up to a staff member and said i wanted to adopt these two cats they had me fill out a little bit of paperwork mostly just my name address and if i owned or rented my home and within minutes we were loading them up and taking them home i was kind of shocked by how easy it was i m glad shelters are trying to find their animals good homes but they maybe need to find a middle ground between shoving the animals out to whoever strolls in and needing to know every personal details
our local animal control is the only adoption place in town that isn t a privately run rescue the pets are dollars each for cats and dogs for small animals everyone comes fixed and up to date on all their shots they run adoption events constantly offering pets to homes for as little as dollars it s a minute process name address give them your card and you re on your way they don t care where you live as long as you have a valid address i think they ask about landlords but as we own a home we ve never gotten very far down that path is it a perfect solution to the to many pets problem absolutely not do they get a lot of homeless animals out of the shelters and into a family definitely
isn‚Äôt the vetting process good though to prevent them from going to bad homes
it probably depends on the shelter most places want to know if you rent vs own just because they don t want to get the animal back if the landlord says no
i adopted two cats from seperate shelters the first time the shelter called my references because i d never had a cat before they asked if they could do a house visit and talk to my landlord i said yes but they never did either of those things talking to my references was enough for them and i got my cat the next day the second time i gave them the same references and added my vet again they asked if a house visit was okay i said yes they looked at my application saw that i d adopted before and already had a vet and i walked out with a kitten they didn t call a single person going in the process seemed way more difficult than it actually was
in philly some adoption centers like paws want every kind of reference to visit the house look at the yard talk to your neighbors while pspca or acct does empty the center days where they waive all adoption fees and all they need is id and questionnaires
look for shelters with open adoption policies to avoid those difficulties but keep in mind these shelters also experience a high rate of return
in my experience you described what its like to get a dog to get a cat they ll give you some buy one get three free sale shit
yea our shelters make it super hard twice i tried adopting a cat and by the time they approved my paperwork someone else had already adopted the cat i liked for some idiotic reason the paperwork approvals didn t roll forward it took them a week to get a hold of my landlord for approval apparently the management company wasn t good enough had to be the owner of my rental house who was on vacation when i went to adopt my dog i didn t want to deal with their shitty process straight up lied on the application gave them my mom s number and said she was my landlord said i was single my husband and i met with the dog and loved her but they required all members of the household to do adoption counseling which took about an hour and had to be done between am pm he couldn t take another hour off work that day after about four hours of frantic paperwork phone calls and waiting we got approved two other families there were going for the same dog and were pissed then the fucking shelter wouldn t let us bring her home for two weeks because she had to be spayed but they wouldn t let us use our vet and their vet had a two week backup so she sat in the shelter for two more miserable weeks i felt awful
it always weirds me out a bit when people post pictures of their new kitten puppy saying well i wasn t going to get one but there we are it shouldn t be that easy it s a big responsibility and you shouldn t just be able to wander in somewhere and walk out half an hour later with a long term pet like a cat or dog we wanted to rescue a dog so we started looking around the local rehoming places we found one dog we loved but were really alarmed when they said just fill out this paperwork and you can take her home today it didn t feel right to me at all so we walked away we found another dog somewhere else and it took us over a month from first meeting to taking her home multiple visits with the home s dog behaviourist and a house visit where they brought her to our house to make sure she was happy there she had the added complication of being deaf and had multiple failed adoptions under her belt so they wanted to make sure we really wanted her but the pacing was spot on for me
i ve never adopted a cat they ve always adopted me i ve actually never had a choice in the matter it turns out that cats aren t all that concerned with references and credit checks they go on intuition and it works pretty well for them
the only time i had issues adopting a cat was when i got my cat ellie we already had month old boys and the shelter wanted to make sure our boys where nutered before we brought ellie home but it was just a quick call to our vet to confirm and we could bring ellie home within an hour
most rescues near me won t adopt out if you didn t have a fenced in yard mind you i spent a lot of money when my cocker spaniel had ivdd
that sucks i ve been maybe undiagnosed add for a very long time and am just now realizing it as for the girlfriend thing that can be very tough to deal with i got out of a bad relationship about four years ago and it still took forever to convince myself that everything was ok even though all the evidence was there that i had not been treated well
that just means she‚Äôs not as strong as you keep your head up as someone who was in a similar position it gets better i promise you are valued by more people than you think
mental illness is difficult to deal with and it often feels much easier to just say fuck it to the whole process of getting better and improving that is why you should be proud of the efforts you‚Äôve made to keep pushing yourself and better your situation
see it as a new start a reset you have the proper meds you will be able to pay bills again start some exercise do what you‚Äôve always wanted to and make that ex regret their decision forever
same hang in there brother nice to know others are out there with same exact situation we got this
i ve been in that exact same position although i was married keep pushing through it will get easier with time i would also recommend getting your testosterone level checked i m only but i had low t and it made my depression x worse and completely unmanageable once i started treatment i turned around almost immediately
just wanted to say when one door closes another opens and relationships are wildly crazy in there can be only outcomes from a romantic one‚Äî either it will end sometime duration unknown or you can get married amp also have duration unknown lol so look at this as an opportunity for new friendships amp a new relationship amp a new health start üëçüèª positive vibes from this internet stranger you got this
oof hey you had a relationship for years congrats i have a personality disorder and have never had a relationship last for longer than a few months finally on meds and had good therapy and at this point i m not even that interested in getting a relationship going still working on me i need to exercise before i can flex her thighs
props for pushing forward it can be so incredibly difficult sounds like you ve got a plan i hope you also have a some supportive and decent people around you
i hear you with my heart ugh i have a deaf dog and this legit made me cry a little lt
how do you do it how is it possible to learn this power
shut up jerk why is there water leaking from my eyes
i was hoping i d find one of yours here i hear you with my heart üíïüíïüò≠üò≠üò≠
dammit now i have to mop the floor i hate mopping the floor üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
usually your poems are insufferable because of the ridiculous baby animal speak nonsense but this one actually has merit glad you didn t feel the need to add that doggo stuff
jee zus falcon punch to the fucking feels i‚Äôm crying
aw i‚Äôd like to think my deaf pup also feels like this about me ‚ù§Ô∏è
highjacking top comment as a lot of people with deaf dogs didnt know this trick another tip is if they re sleeping and you re leaving the room wake them up otherwise you just disappear when they wake up
this dude always posts drawings in every post so he uses a program right
such a sweet drawing really encompasses the situation
this is what i call art not the bullcrap we see nowadays at the museum have an upvote seuix
wow i love your style it captured the warmth and love in the video well do you have a website for more artwork
while i appreciate the art it seems you edit every single comment with i understand some people would like a commission pm me you said it months ago
this is really good it s like water color comic book
this is the exact moment i was hoping you drew before i clicked your link i really love this one great work
i‚Äôve seen a lot of your artwork the past couple days you‚Äôre so talented
it s even more endearing when they re deaf my dog was deaf in his last year he would become so needy and would never leave my side it was bittersweet to see my once independent minpin become my shadow but i enjoyed every moment of it and we had a wonderful life together trying so hard not to cry after seeing this video and recalling my life with him
confirmed my father bought the family akita puppies each for a total of and it was the best purchase i got him to make i seldom get to spend with them i‚Äôm an international baccalaureate student but nonetheless those pups love the shit out of me
i have a year old shiba inu who i rescued as a very young pup and he never wags his tail and never likes pets its the saddest thing i just want to love him and he only wants to play tug of war
what s that saying about locking your wife and dog in the closet let them out in a few minutes and only one will be happy to see you you don t do it but you know it s true
people say that as if it s supposed to be impressive we selectively bred this animal until it s mind is so completely broken its happiness is codependent on ours doesn t quite have the same ring to it
my priest told us a few days ago that when he needs a reality check about his morals he aspires to be the person that my dog thinks i am i want that on a bumper sticker i love my dog so much
the entire reply thread after oranges comment is why i love reddit sure there can be some assholes but the amount of people who can show true empathy over the internet on this site is such a wonderful thing i love this place
i‚Äôm sending you a virtual hug i know how you feel üíö
guys could somebody guild u shittyguitarresponse for me i really think this guy needs one
my minpin became partially deaf and partially blind after also becoming diabetic long story good life he‚Äôs luckily still somewhat independent but he‚Äôs wary of my sisters doberman now unfortunately the dobie is a big goof who runs too fast for my min to get out of the way he‚Äôs a really good dog though wants to learn all the tricks and listens just doesn‚Äôt realize how he can‚Äôt just run over the small dogs we‚Äôre working on that
missing a dog is one of the hardest feelings their life goes by so fast my two dogs were with me since they were puppies seeing them in their old age getting sick losing their sight going deaf is just heartbreaking because you‚Äôre still young but their lives already went by we have them for such a short time because we don‚Äôt deserve dogs
mi dog is perfectly normal and does the same he can t stand alone too much he just follows you everywhere even if you are in the shower he will stay in front of the bathroom waiting
thank you for giving that beautiful soul a wonderful life
damn someone s cutting them onions by me again we are blessed to know the companionship and love our pets bring us while the end is said we should celebrate their life and the joy and happiness brought
i can really relate last year i lost my childhood dog maisy her legs finally gave up at a grand old age of i d had her since i was she made it to my wedding last june as one of our bridesmaids and her final day she was surrounded by her family and she passed peacefully when my folks and i get together we can just just sit and sob thinking about her she was ¬£ from a rescue shelter and she travelled thousands of miles around the whole country what a dog
i also have a min pin great little companions what was your boy s name
you sound like a wonderful person and i m sure your friend enjoyed every moment in his her life with you the simplest things like watching your dog looking through the window can be the most pure memories thank you for sharing this i loved reading it
you seem like such a lovely person i mean that in the best possible way thank you for being you
i‚Äôm sitting here with my girl right now grilling and she‚Äôs asleep right next to my chair thank you for helping me appreciate this moment more dogs are like puzzle pieces that help complete people
it‚Äôs just dangerous because they‚Äôre often right on your leg and tend to get in front of you and stop i was carrying a case of bottle water in this morning and almost fell down on top my year old jack russell
i m not trying to force my religion hear on anyone i just wanted to share my feelings i m a christian and have had many pets since i was halved raised by one i love them all dearly and it hurts so much when they are gone it s the little things that hurts them most the sound of their footsteps their little quirks etc again i am not trying to push my agenda here but i really really do believe i ll see them again i always imagine this big field of golden tall wheat and i see many dogs and cats running towards me i still sobb everytime i think about it i am now
the way it s fur is clumped and lying at different angles that s a sign of a serious illness it s also seen on dead cats
gotta be dead the cat looks clearer than the human none of my cats are ever still even when they‚Äôre asleep
the cat definitely looks off but it looks like it s digging its claws into the wicker top there so probably not dead unless them managed to stuff it in that pose it might just be drugged for the photo or something you had to stand still for photos back then and i doubt the cat would cooperate otherwise
pretty sure it must be as photos back then took minutes to take i believe if anyone anything moved during that time i think they would appear as a white blur either that s the best behaved cat ever to have lived or it s a decent attempt at early taxidermy
that s maureen ponderosa she s just had a lot of work done
i dunno to me it just looks like the cat doesn t want to sit still and she s squeezing it s leg to sort of pin it between her arm and her shoulder
it looks like an old old or very sick cat likely has given up on cleaning itself and life in general the girl probably wanted a picture with mr ms whiskers before it died
the exposure time on these old photos was quite long no way a cat would stay still for that much time it s probably stuffed
century old photos of animals all look off animals just used to look slightly different i guess
this is the only way i‚Äôd be able to pose with my cats
aren t these the old photos where you had to sit still for quite a while which made everyone a little blurred only asking because they both appear to be in focus
i would assume the cat is dead stuffed cameras back then needed one to be still for several minutes i cant even get my cat to sit still for a few seconds
in the early s the subject needed to be perfectly still for a while in order to get a good picture that cat is perfectly in focus it didn t move for the entire time the lens was opened its dead
that s the picture we need to see this little guy s in sad shape thank you for helping
cat wants nothing to do with them all i can think about is this quote there s bad blood jealousies cliques
cats first week will hate them after that is not going to be available to live without them lt
thank you for helping them but you should know that flea baths for a kitten that young are i m pretty sure not recommended that s toxic stuff
aight you gotta pay the edit tax show more pictures
thank you so much as someone with two adopted kitties that had a tough past this means so much
hopefully you see this comment if you want your cat to be friends with them scratch theon under the chin and then use the same hand to scratch your other cat under the chin then back to theon do the same with yara and your other cat keep doing this until they like eachother you putting their pheromones onto eachother so they think they re part of the same pack
i m so happy he went to you for help he and his sister are just the cutest thanks for being a good human
we named our rescue pup yara as well apparently it is a a name in many different languages it s a beautiful goddess in portuguese and means little butterfly in arabic thank you for saving them
i love them i love the names and thank you so much for helping them
love that your dog s first instinct is these are mine now
you should have a look around to see if there s any more or their mother also look into feeding routines i also know that kittens need assistance with making bowel movements by way of massage stimulation but i m not sure if these guys are old enough now that that s no longer necessary
yara telling the bf to heck off while uncle bruce watches intently amp x b uncle bruce is giving the bf some of those leave my bebe s alone eyes
theon and yara could not be more perfect what is dead may never die
if you need help ensuring the cats get along message me just a small amount of effort will help ensure all of the cats get along better resulting in reduced stress for them and you
i saved this post just to check back in so happy theon is doing better
i m glad i m not the only one who read it like that
i m glad i m not the only one who saw the titleand immediately came up with the word perutie
omg the fleas on the second one thank you for helping them
please give us an update tomorrow and the next day and the next with pics
pedialyte look up fading kitten syndrome it s gonna take a lot of work to keep this guy alive
please make sure it wasn t unintentionally the flea shampoo it might be too strong for a kitten especially one that was bloody from flea bites
i volunteer at a cat shelter and i have some experience with those tiny demons give them wet food i have seen lethargic cats completely changed in a couple of seconds the food in the can i saw in your first picture is a little too thick for them i would add some water use a wet paper towel or a washcloth on their private parts to stimulate them to pee defecate keep them in a small space until they put on some weight if their bellies are really round it s because they are probably filed with worms take them to the vet to get some meds good luck with your new babies
oh god those bebes were flea infested bless your heart for helping them you are a good human
oh wow they look so much better after the bath i hope theon is doing okay and starts taking fluids thanks for taking those poor babies in
it would have been more fitting to wait until after your got him neutered before you named him theon perhaps reek could be his bad cat name when he does something wrong
i m so irrationally mad at those fleas like get off that baby you sons a bitches
do you have any corn syrup putting it on the kittens gums for a couple of minutes can really save fading kittens getting them warm is very important too best of luck to you
when kitten becomes lethargic use drop of karo syrup every minutes for minutes source foster kitten mom for local cat rescue
that‚Äôs no way got a kitten to live thanks for taking them in
those are wonderful names and they look like spunky kittens when they are feeling better they are sure to be troublemakers but they will also bring you a lot of joy
oofff you can t call a boy cat theon because at some point you have to go get him neutered and that shit is just in bad taste varys and grey worm would also be in bad taste p
theon eh you may want to keep him away from anything vaguely blue and made of ice
oh christ he was in bad shape great to hear that he s doing better from your other replies kudos to you guys
you re welcome i hope it won t get to that but if the kitten doesn t get better with wet food you re gonna have to give him fluids every hours yep even during the night they dehydrate really fast at that age
i ve heard that chicken baby food also helps like gerber chicken
when you take them to the vet be sure to mention the fleas or show the picture shudder the little ones may be a bit anemic from hosting the tiny bloodsuckers and the vet could give you some iron supplements or maybe regular kitten food is high enough in iron
these kittens have the teeth that say they can eat gruel dilute wet food with water if they don t eat then you puree that mix and try syringe feeding but honestly doubtful it is needed and bottle babies need expressing the damp baby wipe idea but once kittens start eating gruel they don t need this anymore that flea bath btw must have felt amazing especially to the second one poor thing was being eaten alive and looks amazing after the bath props for taking them in
if they were covered in fleas it s also possible they have anemia from the fleas feeding
baby food by which i do not mean kitten food human baby food it‚Äôs a literal lifesaver for fading kittens
definitely try to give him a slurry wet food mixed with water as runny as possibly to keep his kidneys in good shape kittens should be normally fed every hours or so but sick kittens should really be monitored every you re incredibly kind hearted to care for these critters i ve rescued about kittens in the past three years and have only lost don t hesitate to ask for advice but advice over the internet will never be as efficient as having them examined by a vet or even a rescue shelter
try baby food too plain chicken flavor with no onions or anything in it great for fading kittens
you can throw in some kmr kitten milk replacement too they look really young milbemax or panacur from your vet immediately to get rid of worms like the above person said even if they don t look wormy it s a good idea
you can also rub some corn syrup on his gums for a bit of an energy push i wouldn‚Äôt do fluids unless you know the measurements for animals vs humans since humans don‚Äôt generally do sub q unless they are infants or very elderly you can send the kittens into cardiac arrest
i recommend the kitten lady‚Äôs youtube channel she has lots of good advice
i d be totally ok with being compared with cows like that
yeah a cow like beauty has a different meaning these days
gt meaning she has large gt expressive eyes almost had us there
gt it didn t go well eris thought it was one hell of a party though
hera cursed a woman that was swan raped by zues her husband
"there‚Äôs an expression where i come from
‚Äúthe cow with the biggest udders has the most farmers pulling on her teets ‚Äú"
gt she had large expressive eyes didn t go where i thought it would
gt it didn t go well but she was one of three and for what its worth paris suddenly having three goddesses descend upon him played the hell out of that situation given that if he had chosen any one based on their virtues or form alone the two others would have been irate well you re all godesses your virtues are all great can i see you all naked yep you re all physically perfect too wouldn t be able to choose between you three well tell you what each of you offer me a gift and i ll choose the fairest of you based on that and paris being the simple man that he was and so very unlike what most of the greeks would consider a hero chose love over glory and skill in battle or wealth and rulership
so that‚Äôs where the term ‚Äúgrumpy cow‚Äù originated then
i was just watching chicago fire yesterday and thinking kara kilmer has cow eyes in a good way
gt she was also in contention for most beautiful in all the land once it didn t go well but she was one of three i ll say it led to around a hunned fifty thousand knuckleheads crossing a sea and destroying a city over a dude s stolen wife
didnt hera also turn one of zeus‚Äô mistress‚Äôs into a cow io
get outta here with your puns to the milky way with you
gt meaning she had large expressive eyes that s not what i expected to follow large think what a woman might share with a milk cow
"yay i scrolled down through all of the posts looking for this may he have a full recovery to good health ‚ù§Ô∏è
good job"
good god i m so happy what is dead may never die but rises again cuter

i‚Äôm so glad he‚Äôs perked up i used to work for a vet kittens can turn so fast both up and down i‚Äôve got my fingers crossed that he stays up the upswing
why would you name a cat after a man who betrayed everyone he was ever loyal to and got his junk cut off
i‚Äôve been so afraid to check this thread because i know i couldn‚Äôt handle the potential bad news but i couldn‚Äôt handle not knowing so i took a chance and i‚Äôm so glad i did üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è i‚Äôm so grateful he‚Äôs doing better thanks to you two
it s as easy as it s ever been if you actually want to do it you certainly can
veggie isn t too hard you can google all your favourite meals vegetarian and there will be plenty of recipes i went vegan overnight and apart from a couple of days figuring out how to change the recipes i knew it was super easy
the fact you realise this and wish to change makes you one of the good ones
i hope you don t take this the wrong way and becoming a vegetarian is certainly the right direction to go in many vegetarians however think they re at the end of the road that milk eggs honey etc doesn t kill or harm animals but it really does i m not going to post any links here feel free to investigate it yourself if you want just let me leave you with one question what happens to the male calves in the dairy industry and the male chicks in the laying industry
it s much easier than you think it is going vegan for me was far less difficult than i imagined especially with all of the great substitutes these days
stop eating meat it‚Äôs very easy these days also if you want to prevent cruelty to cows you‚Äôll need to become vegan which again is really easy these days
poor little guy fingers crossed for you little fella
eeeee grabby hands i am camping on this thread you don t even know precious babies is deworming today
little man has some fight left in him looks like you are taking the great advice from some really smart people i have also used similac with iron baby formula to nurse back kitten from anemia keep updating kind friend looking forward to seeing the floofers in all their glory

hooved animals especially have a hard time on concrete you can see he s a bit more stable once he gets off the street
little guy is like tahh fuck not again shit alright lemme take a breather ok let s give this shit another try theeeeerrreee we go thanks for being so patient jeff
beautiful and extremely dangerous you don‚Äôt wanna fuck with moose
that is purity as it s best i backpack and i see a side of life most people will never ever see
they both look dehydrated it s something you pick up on when you read enough reddit comments
me in the car ha ha walk much puts hand up for a high five realizes i m alone i m always alone
i love the kind of silent understanding that the drivers will patiently allow them to cross
do they look like they need help i think they re doing fine
yeah waiting patiently is probably the best thing you can do in that situation
just saw a video of a cow moose on the other side of a highway divider with calf trying to get over this went on for a few minutes until someone positioned their truck go out and tossed the calf over mama was upset but didn t attack luckily their hooves are dangerous and i hear they bite sisters all true except biting sisters or is that true too
i don t have moose s in my country if i saw that i would probably try to pet the mom and play with the baby before having my body destroyed
accurate i hid for my life behind a dumpster at fort wainwright in fairbanks when a mother and a newborn were walking down the street she beat the fuck out of the dumpster trying to get to me it as an experience i would avoid times in the future
we like being alive we like being alive we like being oh we like being oh we like being alive
it s too bad moose are so dangerous they look like they d love hugs
‚Äúi think you‚Äôre pretty neat but i respect your distance ‚Äù
lol i was going to say ‚Äúwhy wouldn‚Äôt somebody go help the baby ‚Äù as a joke
i would totally be cheering the baby on in the safety of my car you can do it little one you can do it lol
they are the size of cars truly awesome there s a youtube video of some cross country skiers that encounter one in the wild and the damn thing sprints through chest high snow at full speed mph like it s nothing
i ve lived around moose all my life and some of them get absolutely enormous some of them would be about m tall they are usually never agressive though from my experience had to walk roughly km each day to get to the school bus and had to walk past moose at least once a week they had some tree s they loved chew on near the road and sometimes i d be less than meters away from them with only the tree s inbetween they usually just stared at me and would only move if i actually did something that looked like i was moving towards them which i learned quickly could be a bad idea have never been attacked by a moose tho and have fed one from my hand while a male moose was standing in our garden near our porch was a lovely experience
i ve seen one when i i drove through colorado and it was fucking massive like the size of a truck massive
in mating season the males will also occasionally challenge cars on the highway to a duel of headbutt
they seem like big funny silly creatures but just like the hippopotamus they are no joke they will kill you if they want to my dad goes hunting up north every year to bring home moose meat for the year we live in canada he said one time he stumbled backwards as an angry moose approached out of the water and he literally thought ‚Äúthis is it i‚Äôm done this is me dying now ‚Äù fortunately my dad is still here on this earth but the respect for these giants is something he‚Äôs passed down to us
i once saw a young female moose in the wild dude that thing was already so big its actually crazy scary how big they are
so if you‚Äôre say ‚Äô ‚Äù and you‚Äôre facing a grown male your face is somewhere between the upper part of his legs and his chest most terrifying moment after opening a cabin door in grand tetons was meeting a moose happily chewing all the flowers in front of the cabin
lpt if a moose runs in front of your car you‚Äôre never supposed to swerve if they don‚Äôt move out of the way fast enough and you‚Äôre going to hit it after slamming on the breaks tap the gas it raises the front of the car so that you hit the body and not the legs if you hit the legs that giant thing will come through your windshield and crush you
gt are moose that aggressive that you run the risk of dying every time you encounter one yes especially if it s a mom
i ve heard they re the most dangerous animal in north america at any rate if this moose had wanted to hurt these people there was very little they could ve done to defend themselves assuming they were unarmed
not so much aggressive but they spook easy and defensive is more than dangerous enough for a tank horse
they re pretty much ton anger machines powered by stupid
i‚Äôm from ohio where whitetails reign king now i lived in breckenridge colorado moose will absolutely stand their ground they have no fear of charging you especially when they have a baby around soon as the hair on the neck stand up and their ears get pinned back back the fuck up slowly and get behind something i genuinely would rather run into a black bear on a trail than a moose
no they‚Äôre not i was hiking in gasp√©sie in qc last year and we saw four of them close enough to take pictures they were not together we left them alone and they left us alone one was lying around two were eating one was with her baby that said if they feel threatened they can charge and because they‚Äôre absolutely massive you could be badly injured kinda like being hit by a car
moose are afraid of nothing they dont give a shit at all
no they are generally not aggressive but if they are you are out of luck the general advice is to try to not get between a calve and their mother
when i was young we‚Äôd throw apples out to whitetails and the occasional moose that would walk by whitetails skitter at the sound of the apple hitting the soft ground ft away i threw an apple near a moose and it hit a fiberglass canoe the bong sound was pretty loud and the moose didn‚Äôt even bat an eye at it they‚Äôre the owner of their space and their space is wherever they want it to be
not at all my parents live pretty much in the middle of a national park i grew up there mooses really don t give a shit about you most of the time because you really pose no threat to them and they know it i encountered some standing on the other side of the fence maybe m away from me i was eating whatever was growing on the fence not paying much attention to me while its mom was watching from a distance another time i encountered the entire family while walking the dog in a forest thankfully the dog was smart enough to stand back the moose family just looked at me not even moving just eating small trees like i weren t even there
moose are dumb as rocks they aren t really malicious just giant and stupid
noone wants to disturb a momma and her baby either people are good people
exactly because between the two of you the odds of the moose surviving are much higher than yours
first thing i did after getting my licence well about a week after anyhow fucking terrifying
my aunt and uncle hit a moose on the highway once well i say they hit a moose but really a transport coming the other way hit it and sent it flying onto their car the only thing that saved them was having their canoe tied onto the top of the car so the rope absorbed most of the force and almost cut it in half still my aunt was picking glass out of her face at dinners years later do not fuck with moose
oh no there s a baby moose dead on the road in one of those üò≠
that s happened to my cousin when she was still living in alaska her car was totalled moose are fucking terrifying up close though still cool to see
when i took driver s ed many years ago rural canada my instructor told us several times if you re about to hit an animal just hit it it sucks but trying to avoid it may kill you and others except if it s a moose you will die if you hit a moose
farmers seen it covered it we know a thing or two because we ve seen a thing or two
oh wow far too many of those somehow end up with the moose in the back seat
to be fair those pictures are from cars colliding with a moose not the other way around apart from getting glass smashed in your face you would be best to hide in a stationary car
more like ‚Äúwhat the morgue would say‚Äù i live in canada and these guys are a one way ticket to dead town if you hit them
my father in law hit a moose with his truck about ten years ago he saw the moose s eyes very quickly it was night and swerved but he grazed it and it took off the whole side of his truck they were lucky if you hit one head on you ll buckle it s knees and it will crush you and the car his insurance wrote off the vehicle and it was no fault in areas where there s lots of moose you really have to be careful at night they generally just stand there and won t move and are very difficult to see
i‚Äôm a us citizen who is native born i don‚Äôt come from wealth and have worked unbelievably hard for my family to survive to be honest i don‚Äôt need the competition for jobs from people willing to work for less i need to be able to make ends meat and then some so that we can move forward california especially being so wealthy and so flooded by immigrants seems to have this fast expanding gap between the high and low class seems very much to do with so many low income people moving here so fast and having no way to deal with that on top of so many homeless moving here to be frank i‚Äôm living with fear in my heart everyday of the floor dropping out from under me and i‚Äôm trying with everything i have i‚Äôm always working it‚Äôs so hard to fight to the top when the gap is so big i feel like i‚Äôm getting pulled down by the wave of poor that keep coming
so did my grand parents when they immigrated from italy so would you and your family if your migrated to a new country why do people on reddit demand hand outs and an easy life
gt a college grad took photos with her immigrant parents in the fruit fields where they worked to give her a better life there is no shortcut to any place worth going happiness lies in the fulfillment
you want to redistribute people s wealth so we can all live like that
the whole thing is weird those guys are living the american dream and that is awesome but when so many are doing it and not living the american ideal then i think that s where the problem is you should pay taxes you should be a good neighbor but then theres lot of people coming in and dealing drugs or doing gang activities the us does not have so much some areas are overcrowded as fuck and blaming one side republicans or dems dont mean jack shit either answers require complex solutions neither of which we have
because half or over half of us citizens hate immigrants and people who arent white
because there isn‚Äôt unlimited money and we have money to everyone itd last a year or two and everyone would be broke aka communism
some of us look at it as a glass half full type of thing
america is and always has been about people working their butts off to make their lives and their childrens‚Äô lives better
hi i d like to see where they say they had to deal with racism any proof they aren t vile racists themselves
gt those parents worked their butts off under hard conditions dealing with poor pay and racism sacrificing for their daughter replace racism with bigotry and daughter with children and you have my polish great grandparents they arrived a little over years ago i could write a book all i ll say here is that so many americans have this story in common
meh minimal skill jobs are what they could get with no school or language they probably made minimum wage to bucks an hour i just read a story how tomato pickers in florida are making bucks an hour so it s not that bad i chopped xmas trees next to immigrants when i was for just above minimum back then it s hard tedious work but you take what you get
because maybe those things belong to the people there legally who pay the taxes and follow the rules
if the parents were illegal immigrants then it s not a system set up for them anyway if they aren t illegal immigrants and did that legally then it s because the system is set up to exploit labor at that level if a country is going to be fairly open to immigrants then this is what the work is going to look like countries that have a bit more sustainable vision and don t go through such austerity measures typically seeing more educated and skilled immigrants the us also has so much because of this system too many people now have too much money while the rest are suffering so i won t turn on the average american though no one lives in averages but it s a little galling to ask why a country with so much can t just share it around unless you meant something else
they gave up and left him on the tree from about p he was tied and they all left about p we were there until p i think they wanted him to swim he just wasn t having it and they were angry because he s weeks and being difficult and a puppy i don t know why they left him but he was left i didn t steal the dog
who leaves the puppy with all of your stuff with a group of like people i love dogs but i would never just take one without actually considering if his parents were to come back
why would someone leave their dog tied to a tree in a park by itself to get it treats and toys
that‚Äôs pretty far fetched if they just left him they abandoned him and who are you to judge you weren‚Äôt there
op either stole a puppy from a random family or some family couldt drown a puppy so they tied it to a tree whats moore believable
looks like a border collie they usually hate water due to their extra thick under coat don‚Äôt doubt a family trying to drag this dog in would be due to the dog refusing and then just giving up borders are wonderful but are super high energy puppers usually also not a cheap dog because they‚Äôre working dogs and people do like them purebreds
you are right about the story not added up literally states at the bottom that they hope the dog isn t stolen oike they are admitting guilt they know the dog is stolen but hope their isn t a chip when they take him to the vet dude needs to change is reddit name to puppy bandit cause that s what this person is they cleverly snatched up a dog from the park while the adults and kids swam who in their right moral standing watches a family leave their dog and not go speak to those people before they leave they state they untied to dog and he just wanted to be held but then later say he was untied and immediately took to water no one with kids attached to a dog just leaves that dog it s easier for me to believe that your a horrible person who stole a dog then people and children left their dog on a family trip to a state park
actually your story doesn‚Äôt add up op never said they were trying to drown it just that their attention was drawn to where the dog was because it was being forced into the water and if you brought the dog with you why wouldn‚Äôt you bring the dog with you where you are going regardless if you are coming back regardless of whether or not you think its cruel to leave a puppy tied up alone it‚Äôs irresponsible as hell don‚Äôt worry op you did the right thing
they tried dragging him to the river but when op freed him he wanted to go to the river for a drink huh
he‚Äôs damn woulda been if it weren‚Äôt for the quantum realm
you should have linked to that clip he always plays on conan
fun fact none of those white uniforms are real they‚Äôre all cgi
wtf kind of picture is that a yr old could look good from that angle and light
the funniest thing is that paul rudd too reminds me of a golden retriever
i heard it s because he feeds off the tears of dragonflies that s the secret to his youth üòÑ
i turned my volume on to see what my cat would do he‚Äôs still very asleep
my cat is right next to me and didn t move a muscle
my dog thinks he just ran to the door to bark at the neighbor cat
mine ran over to me as well and started looking at my phone she‚Äôs obsessed with watching it
same thing here my cat was sleeping next to me heard the sound looked up at me and fell back asleep after seconds
yep both cats and dog just entered my room and are looking around
then he saw me crying and climbed up to drink my tears
i played it for my cat and he just stared at me like he always does
when you think you can t reach both extremes lion snuggles happen
they‚Äôre so much like house cats serene noble expression while being ridiculously cute
why is it lions are more affectionate than my house cats
i had a dream like this the other night except i didn‚Äôt get hugs like this lucky guy i just died
having experience with many different living creatures of all different shapes sizes and environments i can say when you have spent significant time with a living thing being it lion fish even insects you can read its body language as though it were speaking plain english this guy knew long before the approach that this lion was excited to see him and was coming for a snuggle because the lion said it in its body language to him because that is his lion and he is that lions human this sounds like just big mushy emotions talking and do not get me wrong the mushiest of emotions come into this kind of connection but it really is a pragmatic observation i have come to from careful observation with my best efforts to separate emotion from it before coming to this conclusion even somebody that lacks all emotions could do it if they spent enough time with the other critter just by reading subtle cues and knowing the personality of the critter in question
yeah snuggling with something that could accidentally disembowel you without an ounce of malice is just not my idea of a good time
only terrifying once the lion realizes you have to go like a dog except a lion can physically make you stay longer for snuggles
he had both hands on his head like please don t eat me
tamer or no do you know the balls it takes have a lion charging at you and just stand there and absorb it that is a gamble you only get to be wrong about once
then two months later white adventurer dies by african lion
hijacking top comment to say this is kevin richardson aka the lion whisperer he recently hit mil on youtube and is also on instagram highly suggest checking him out
at first it looked terrifying and then the man died when both of them just flopped lovingly on top of him crushed by love
‚Äúif you were anyone else i‚Äôd eat you but you are my best fren ‚Äù
i was scrolling and didn t see the title i just assumed a really nsfw gif was about to wreck my evening
for a second there i thought someone almost became dinner
if they want to snuggle you there isn t much you can do
yup even when my cat is affectionately playing with me he can scratch me up lion claws
i get it that headbutts are a cats way of showing trust and affection but when their skull is larger than yours it can get a bit intimidating
this is my most favorite one you‚Äôve made so far all of your other works are all amazing too
i did one as well of them in the nude but that one is for me
you re incredibly talented maybe send it to kevin and he can give you a shout out you can get some commissions my parents were designers artists and did a lot of graphic work for the body shop in the nineties this would fit in the body shop was all about conservation and partnering with wwf now a mere years later the world has gone too far and is officially doomed
why is tjis tagged nsfw you made me think you turned it into gore art
i like this one but my fav is the guy with the huge dog i don t have a dog but i wouldn t mind that one hanging on my wall you ve got talent to make simple colours look great
i think it‚Äôs time to give the second chicken a name too they‚Äôre both so lovely
so my knowledge of the indian language is quite limited but i have had chicken masala at the chaat house did you name your chicken after a chicken dish
i like your username xd kd is definitely not a snake üòå
maggi seems like a suitable name for the nd one based on masala chaat ü§≠ü§≠ü§≠
when i was like years old my grandparents got some chicks and let the three grandkids name them my older cousins came up with respectable names for theirs but after i found a top of a pepsi bottle on the floor of our van loudly declared that i named my chicks pepsi and lid
can you name the other one dahi puri spicy and sweet
i love food names my cats are named hibachi and tofu
i ve been through the india on a chicken with no name
did you hear about the woman who got attacked on safari by one she survived lost part of upper leg muscle must have been horrifying
teeth the length of your arm never not scary it s like the have horns in their mouth
yeah it‚Äôs no wonder they‚Äôre often identified with the biblical behemoth
hippos are great animals safar tourists just don t understand to not fuck with them or any other animal in that case
nah i ll just send my tiger you can send your lion if you want
jaguars gt any other big cat dont fight me am karate expert silent air chop
nope tigers are much stronger they can easily defeat lions
you bring your lion i ll bring my tiger the apology can be written or verbal
leopards for me i love lions so so much i ve watched them hunt and kill i love seeing a pride and the members meet up so much snuzzling i ve seen tiny little baby cubs playing around but i ve never seen a leopard hunt they are deadly stealthy and completely independent i saw baby leopards on the bank of a river in sa after their mama left for a hunt they climbed up the nearest tree i ve seen male leopards engaging in a territory war i ve seen plenty eating in trees and hear as they crushed the bones of their prey my ultimate bucket list animal is seeing the snow leopard it s such an amazingly beautiful cat to me to see it with my own eyes in the wild i could never go back to east african safaris again and be happy
which then brought tears to his eyes if he passed through the cloud at head height
it probably brought a tear to your son s eyes as well
just imagine them covered in fur like a grizzly bear
gt they are the deadliest animal in africa mosquitos would like a word
why are they so crazy aggressive and territorial it s hard to thing of any other similarly behaved creature
if i m not mistaken steve irwin also was quite wary of them something like watching them gliding lazily by while he was boating and wondering if they would suddenly attack
it is rather silly when people don t realize hippos are dangerous they re gigantic and have gigantic mouths how is that not supposed to be judged as dangerous given seconds of critical thought
please include large animal or mammal in your description the malaria parasite would rank in the animal category yes parasites are animals too
it s the same with blacksmithing when i m demonstrating adults usually either stand for a minute looking politely interested before moving on or they stick around talking at me about how much they already know about blacksmithing kids on the other hand will either not care at all if it s not their bag or be utterly transfixed by what s going on in front of them
i‚Äôm often curious if it‚Äôs the same to perform to tripping teens and adults at a music festival mentally these folks lsd at least are children and engrossed by what you‚Äôre doing on the other hand it‚Äôs kinda like performing to a sea of blank stares
this is so true i play in a local bluegrass band and one of the funnest things about it is watching the reactions of kids
out of curiosity if you are a musician yourself never know maybe you stopped playing or something what gesture or action would you like to see from adults a hug like this kid did would obviously be creepy for an adult to do lol so what are your thoughts an equivalent of the sort
i got chills watching this so incredibly sweet pure fascination and what an amazing feeling as a musician too i miss playing mine
‚Äúmost‚Äù can‚Äôt count how many times heard a violin player in a restaurant or on a street that i get drawn too always my favorite instrument to hear probably because this happened when i was a baby too
adults look past you because you re on the street corner asking for money and we re trained to disregard that
no offense but i‚Äôm much more in awe for the kid being able to hear it seems a little weird to turn this situation into how awesome it is to have someone watch you perform vs someone conquering a disability
and animals when they just sit there mesmerized taking in all the stimuli or even appear to have fun
i remember the first time i heard someone playing the violin i sat there and actually cried i loved the sound that much and they were just so talented i wanted to understand and do that to unfortunately i was discouraged from the violin by my parents who couldn‚Äôt afford to rent one or the lessons but i eventually learnt other instruments in some ways it makes me sad but in other ways it‚Äôs nice still having the utter wonder and awe when listening to it even in my ‚Äôs i‚Äôm still that little kid
my nephew saw my guitar in my room so i took it out and started playing secs later he gets this mean look in his face and then just leaves
my faith in humanity has been completely and utterly restored
well that just makes me feel bad about when i myself was young years or close and some much younger kid just stared at me while i played a song on violin at school during some christmas celebration thingummy i was mostly just put off by his staring xd
yeah right most adults would want to bone her while she is playing that violin but they won t reveal that instead people will stay quiet don t underestimate people s love for something based on their outward emotions
they don t have the best of judgment i m shit but toddlers still enjoy it
funfact we re estimated to have heard more than of our sounds before the age of due to our hearing constantly getting impaired the older we get there s a reason most movies have that distant child laughter sound during dreams because we honestly can t hear it like we used to as kids children of men has a scene dedicated to it the fact that pretty much any sound costs our hearing
i hear live music anywhere i m drawn to it like a magnet i live in a circus and performing town with lots of art mixed in to boot there are people doing cool stuff all over where i live and i am always sucked in every time luckily i moved downtown i was walking to get dinner the other day and i walked by the pub next to my apartment and there were fiddlers flautists woodwind and accordionists playing inside it was a tremendous noise i had to go inside and get a pint and sit a while absolutely magical
i read a story once about a musician who was playing in a subway and got like in tips and the only people that would actually stop and listen where kids turned out the musician was super famous in his field and his performances usually sell out
i mean in our defense if you re busking and we don t have the cash to spare you what the performance is worth we must pretend we can t hear you so it doesn t seem like theft of services lol
great point u suck my thicc seeing children s glee and sense of wonder of the world is incredible
i was in the french quarter years ago and a woman was playing a guitar the tiniest prettiest little girl ran up and was dancing to the music mom just smiled and let her go for it pretty soon the woman had quite a crowd and everyone especially the child was having a wonderful time adults are too busy to take the time to remember when music was pure joy
i have like no experience with being around kids but i volunteered to do some face painting at a fair i had no experience with face painting eithee but i am an artist so i wanted to bring my own creativity to it the kids liked their face paintings but one little girl sat and watched and talked to me for like or minutes she asked me several questions because she was obviously very taken with what i could do with some face paint she asked me how i learned and if i can paint pictures too how i make the different colors and why i was using different brushes we talked about art class and why we both like d it because you can let your imagination create things i think i inspired her and it was a very rewarding experience for me as well some kids are freaking awesome
as an artist in general watching developing minds become infatuated with creativity it makes me wanna weep
musicians are constantly receiving mostly constructive criticism so it s such a joy to have a strictly positive reaction to your performance nobody else in my family is into classical music but they all attended my senior recital in college i will never forget finishing my last piece a crazy difficult technical piece that i just loved and after i finished the last note but the sound was still ringing i hear my dad whisper wow best feeling ever
meh the kid is just waiting for her to play the devil went down to georgia
i think you‚Äôd be creeped out if an adult looked at your face and grabbed your leg while you‚Äôre playing the violin
my nephew had on this face when carolers came by our restaurant table one christmas when he was just under two years old i have a photo of him just looking at the choir with his mouth open with genuine awe it was the first time he d ever heard voices sound like that he s now and still loves music poor little dude can t sing for shit though
is that the best feeling though if you asked mozart what he looked forward to the most would he say oh it s when a baby likes it that makes it all worth it
sweet mother of fuck how i want to see what its doing to gain and maintain that speed
this is my hesitation when i see this hippos don t swim post every other week what do you call this video that river is not shallow enough that the hippo is running on the bottom that fast what are they doing if not swimming
ok i have confusion if they can t swim how do they reach the surface when they re in deep water
that s the most terrifying thing per second of film i ve ever seen in my life
that is clearly the work of a magician hippo who has twin hippos closer and farther from the boat
seems like everyday is a til on how seemingly fat animals are in fact very fast like bears fat yeah i think i can outrun one think again bears can top mph
this is the video that came to my mind as well that water looks like it‚Äôs too deep for the hippo to be running across the bottom and generating that wake it‚Äôs got to be swimming right
kids just know how to make you feel good man they re so full of wonder and give you the chance to show off and ramble about your passion that most adults would get bored with but btw i m not a blacksmith but i think its absolutely amazing and such a cool skill to have good on ya
wait what i d be so interested watching a blacksmith demonstration adults don t find this appealing
as an adult i love watching blacksmithing stuff but i can‚Äôt wrap my head around doing it i know i want to work with wood but i skipped shop class in hs and my family are mechanics so alas i am still lost
i actually started letting talented people know how genuinely interesting are awesome i find what they‚Äôre doing i generally get a good response from them i don‚Äôt go over the top with it but i realized how good it felt when my kids looked at me like i was performing magic while doing things and decided to spread it around i highly recommend it
i d love to be a blacksmith i d chew your ear off big time
the blacksmithing exhibits and demonstrations are always my favorite at historical heritage parks i feel like i could watch them go for hours i ve wanted to try to get involved in it somehow but i never know how to start or what to do with it glass blowing is the other thing i love to watch performed
dude i m and i go into little kid mode every time i see blacksmithing in person to a little kid it probably seems a lot like magic you re literally turning one thing into something completely different
i remember when i was a kid my dad and i visited a glassblower s workshop it was so amazing to watch would be pretty cool to see a blacksmith demonstration now even as an adult but i guess maybe adults are often too stressed to fully appreciate something like it
forged in fire doesn‚Äôt help with people thinking they know everything about making a knife just from watching a tv show
as probably one of the talk at you adults i m just trying to find an excuse to keep hanging around spying on you without looking creepy
awe that s so precious i used to be in ensembles and stuff in high school and i played percussion so kids would always just be so excited about the weird instruments we were playing its gets you hype too like you just want to keep doing it because of the impact you re having on young minds and inspiring them in one way or another
my girlfriend does a lot of vocal solos for orchestral jazz experimental etc performances and i ve heard a few instances of children reacting like this to songs
apparently he was autistic and rarely verbal that adds to the poignancy i feel
thanks for sharing this it s beautiful especially when you read these lines gt ronan didn‚Äôt mean to be disruptive his grandfather told wgbh explaining that his grandson is on the autism spectrum gt i can count on one hand the number of times that he‚Äôs spontaneously ever come out with some expression of how he‚Äôs feeling it makes it extra clear that it was even more special for the kid than just a kid saying wow touching
idk if it‚Äôs because i just woke up or what but this just made me emotional as hell wow
i went to a rough high school and one of my friends played the concert harp for the whole school at assembly and i was thinking this might not end well simply stunned silence for the whole performance and then this beautiful pause while the students appreciated it and you could feel the disappointment from them that it had ended before they applauded almost like the scene from shawshank redemption when he plays the music over the intercom
thank you this made my day and healed my heart depressed mood
damn that restored my faith in humanity for a while
the ‚Äúwow‚Äù signal is believed to indicate the presence of intelligent life
did you mean ensemble instead of assemble as far as i know assemble can only be a verb
not that anyone is likely to see this but i m an aspie for me non vocal and heck some vocal too music is a medium that conveys emotion its why i like bach so much he crafted threads of melody and used them as dancers never stepping on eachothers toes yet remaining distinct sometimes good music does ring through straight to the soul yet for some odd reason i enjoy music in minor keys the most sadness anger fear despair i have no idea why such music fascinates me bachs bwv prelude is one such that one makes me imagine a person walking through life days after his wife died in her sleep with him just wandering lost in the street just as he is within his broken heart hopelessly searching for what he knows he cannot find yet he cannot stop himself the emotions in music can be very intense for me the same applies to oldschool retro games megaman on the nes the third theme for wily s castle if it were to have a title it would be the madness of dr wily it s extremely creepy nes games had some surprisingly dark music hidden within it
thank you so much for this i‚Äôm all choked up i love mozart too ronan
do not click that link it took me to a spam sight when i pressed play
that got me i don t know why but i am seriously choked up and teary you really can hear the awe in his voice
i really like that the mother is asking that not everyone likes to be touched especially while performing so it s really sweet of her to ask if it s alright
that was cute too mum was probably worried it would put the musician off and stop her playing
i bet there are very few cultures in which a mother would apologize for a baby hugging someone
what a time we live in when a baby needs consent to give a hug
the baby did weigh the persons reaction as he got close
it‚Äôs so funny when parents apologize for their kids even if the kids are doing the wrong thing they are so cute they can get away with anything and i will never be upset
do you see that smile from ear to ear that kinda tells you something
i was thinking the other way around but teach his own
foxes don t exercise their arms like the felis schwarzenegger pictured above
gt that‚Äôs a cat head on a fox body good way of putting it
what the hell do you mean it quite honestly looks more like a combination between a lion and a dog i can barely see where you‚Äôre coming from the only relation is that it‚Äôs orange maybe go look up a picture of the animals you‚Äôre describing
i have a little calico with very similar shape and hair i named her li≈°ka which is the czech word for fox
i agree the head is too small for the body looks photoshopped
yea exactly what i thought it s such a weird animal but it s so beautiful at the same time
don‚Äôt worry we‚Äôve been working on that but he‚Äôs a stubborn little panther that likes to drink from the dog‚Äôs water dish from time to time he gets these breakouts from time to time but they haven‚Äôt been as frequent or as bad as they used to be
totally happened to my cat when i was a teen she ended up with big pustules that had to be drained it s a good reminder to clean cats and their food bowls
yes my girl kitty also used to get these though they haven‚Äôt been a problem for about a year in addition to brushing them off i‚Äôd also clean her chin with a cotton swab dipped in equal parts water and apple cider vinegar don‚Äôt use straight vinegar or it‚Äôll burn but the vinegar is also supposed to be good for them when they clean it off too üëçüèª
you re amazing person thank you for the concern and sharing tips and info
thanks for this my girl has a little of this too and i always thought it was just because she s very furry and loves sticking her entire face in things
is that what that is welp gonna go home and nail brush my cat s chin thanks for explaining this and also for doing it in such a friendly way
thank you i didn‚Äôt know and didn‚Äôt think there was much i could do for my kitties but i did start using plastic stuff i will switch back asap
my little one had this too until i changed to stainless steel water dishes and food bowls
one of our cats had this too we switched to a metal watering bowl and cut out any wet food that had fish we think she was allergic
this sucks because my cat won‚Äôt let me scrub his chin like that as it‚Äôs not on his list of approved scritch methods i switched his dish to a glass bowl and it‚Äôs still there i suppose i will try metal next i‚Äôve even considered switching him over to a popular raw food brand i‚Äôm familiar with as he has a little weepy eye too
using ceramic food and water dishes really helps also no plastic or metal
this actually depends on where you are i guess in all of the states usa that i was licensed as an auto claims adjuster in which was ish stopping on the road for an animal and being run into by someone else would not make you liable for the accident that isn t to say that what insurance companies dictate is the same as what is legal a person can break a traffic law and still not be at fault for an accident but generally if what you say were the case then the party who was found at fault in accidents with stopped vehicles on the highway would challenge it in small claims court and would win and then insurance companies would follow through on their liability decisions over time after losing so many claims in court insurance companies are legally required to represent their insured in the event that they re sued in small claims court due to a liability decisions they made this also makes sense from the standpoint of what incentives a driver would have if what you say were true it would be law that in certain instances a person would be required to take an action that would result in damage to his her own property safety also if you don t believe me from a professional standpoint then there is also that i was personally in an accident in tulsa where i stopped for debris some sort of couch that was in the roadway and i was rear ended the reason i had to stop was that a police officer had pulled to the side of the highway and was outside of his vehicle trying to remove the debris this was also around a blind curve so i didn t have adequate time to see it coming the police officer believed as you do that i should be at fault for the accident and on the side of the highway tried to get me to agree to pay for the damages to the front of the other person s car who rear ended me he said that if i did not agree handshake agreement he would cite me for stopping on the roadway i told him i was an auto claims adjuster who determined liability and knew for a fact that i wasn t at fault for this accident he cited me for a statute called improper stopping and we went on our way both insurance companies mine and the other driver s determined that i was not at fault for the accident and his insurance company paid to repair my car i fought the citation in court and won the statute the cop randomly looked up and cited me for applied to vehicles that had been abandoned on the roadway
it s a miracle that nobody hit the poor kitten but it s even better that when the driver stopped there were no fender benders
yep there have been many accidents of people trying to save animals or at least avoid hitting animals it s really a lose lose scenario
yeah i m glad the kitten is ok but instances of this have and continue result in people dying in the road due to wholly unexpected hazards in the uk our highway code defines a hazard as anything that causes a driver to have either change either speed direction or both and by law we are obligated to if necessary for avoiding causing a hazard drive through an animal in our path i e either suddenly slowing or altogether swapping or massively dangerously swerving to attempt to avoid an animal whose own behaviour is completely unpredictable will get you in trouble with the law particularly if you cause an accident which is very likely
i d gladly risk it kitties are innocent and pure unlike humanity
better to loose my car than for a life to be ended like that
yeah and i don‚Äôt give a flying fuck i‚Äôd stop anyway try and fucking tell me not to
from what i can tell in the video this isn t a freeway highway there s a raised curb on the left with paved walking space and a double yellow line on the right with traffic going the opposite direction neither of these are typically present on high speed roads odds are there is enough visibility and a low enough speed limit that stopping for the kitten isn t especially hazardous
i d rather people end up in the hospital than one kitten get squished
that‚Äôs my cousin i let him know you made this for him
wow i look much less hungover in this painting haha thank you for doing that this is awesome
hey you‚Äôre back haven‚Äôt seen any of your comments in a while
you should try to find the original post the video was oc and the op mentioned that the dog had passed away i m sure he ll appreciate your potrait a lot i ll try to find it and will put an edit if i do
oh my goodness this is incredible do you commission i have a wheelchair jack i would just love to have done
how did you have the willpower to not give him an eyepatch i m impressed
you captured his cheeky smile perfectly i love all your work
i knew about the kitties on the moon but i didn‚Äôt know that first part so thank you for teaching me
the best comment of the day goes to the u guywithrealfacts
me just discovering this guy and his titular subreddit ‚Äúi‚Äôll take your entire stock ‚Äù
in hindsight i‚Äôm astounded that this didn‚Äôt end with the undertaker dropping someone through a table
i think the space mice and the space rats eat the cheese and the space cats eat the space rats and space mice
proud of myself for seeing this one coming but also sad because it s more fun realizing you re completely gullible
i think this explains my cat he has this issue with jumping also he s chubby
i actually knew this it s fun to watch my cat do this because she occasionally over pounces and it s entertaining to watch her miss with that oh shit look
my cat don t partake he says muscle tension if fake news
can confirm i foster kittens and have lost two that have achieved escape velocity
whoa thanks for that cool info i always wondered why my cat vibrated with potential energy before he pounced
thank you for the info elli is gorgeous absolutely gorgeous lt
i guess that would explain why i ve never seen a cat with this kind of coat before
that doesn t make this a repost it makes it someone sharing something from ig on reddit
"gt vitiligo
is she telling everyone they re ignorant"
is it just the color change or are there any negative side effects
does it affect the cat s quality of life in any significant way
reddit is a content aggregator posting stuff from other websites is basically its whole purpose then term repost is limited to posts on reddit and does not extend to other platforms
vitiligo is so cool it looks awesome on every creature that has it including humans
looks cool but ive heard this cat is a duck and isn t nice to other cats
i did not know animals got vitiligo cute cat regardless
wow omg thank you so much for telling me that this picture of a cat has been posted previously on the internet ffs
i don‚Äôt care why she is turning what she is a beautiful animal another example of a person with vitaligo and is ‚Äú turning‚Äù dammit accept each and every thing for what and why they are
you can t repost something from another website idiot that is litterally the entire point of reddit to share stuff from other websites on it s only a repost if this image has already been posted on this very subreddit
thanks for spreading awareness didn t know that such cases are possible
i was gonna guess anchorage all that hardwood makes it look pretty cozy
haha i immediately wondered the same thing looks like bozeman to me
it‚Äôs is i work ramp there lots of construction going on for the expansion
i was about to say that i really recognize that airport
when it panned to those iconically contrived rock faced columns i had to watch it again and then open the comments know that place as a place of homecoming so well no wonder i immediately latched onto this video in particular much sublime
for a second i was wondering if most airports just happen to use the same carpets
never heard of a dog living to be that‚Äôs amazing so glad she could be with you for so long
quq i don‚Äôt have a gold thingy for you but i found this star üåü you can have it that‚Äôs so sweet awwww
wow my take away from this comment is that you took such good care of a dog that she lived to be and passed out from excitement after missing you and wondering where you were what a lucky girl coco you must be a very good human ‚ô•Ô∏è i hope i get the existential lottery and be the pet of someone like you next time this is a very beautiful type of love
gt i m pretty sure your dog makes it into some kind of record book if you have the papers is insane
gt keeshonden ohh that sounds serious amp x b googles amp x b oh its the dog my neighbors have one of these and i didnt know the name i wish to bury my face in its coat
that‚Äôs got to be some sort of record holy heck man what a good dog i just woke my pup up with a big hug and ear rubs cuz of this post and your comment lol happy redditing
gt she lived to the ripe old age of oh fuck off there hasn t even been dogs in recorded history that lived that long go make up stories somewhere else
the best thing about dogs is their all the bestest and no matter how hard we try we csn never treat them well enough we dont deserve them at all
don‚Äôt want to be that guy but i‚Äôll be that guy keeshond keeshonden is plural and it sounds like you had one of them
what type of things did you feed her how did you keep her healthy for years
my mom has a friend who s little dog got so excited his little heart couldn t handle it
poor thing might‚Äôve thought you‚Äôd died or something üò´
omg i was reading this thinking about my dog named coco hoping he would love that long and then i got to the bottom blows me away such a lovely story
we have a lab pit mix and whenever one of us is gone more than a couple days she makes that weird high pitch sound too it s like a bark raised a few pitches and drug out for like seconds straight and is just dumb and cute as hell
wow thats amazing do you have any tips you could share i get scared thinking how i only have so much time with my pup and he s barely a year old lol
i grew up with keeshonden from age until my twenties we always had at least one if not more on wood floors i‚Äôve seen one get so excited that her tail started slowly turning her her back feet were sliding from the force of it they are the greatest dogs the oldest one we had reached which was ancient getting one to is astounding
looks up average keeshond lifespan looks up mostly deleted and incoherent comment post history oh bless your ‚ù§Ô∏è
you should contact guinness world records according to wikipedia your dog would be one of the oldest dogs in the world if they could verify it
our oldest dog lived to be big ol giant teddy bear god bless our furry friends
i have pet rabbits and while loving they are much more aloof than dogs i was in hospital for several weeks due to my mental health and when i came back they literally ran up to me and were climbing all over me sadly one passed away unexpectedly but george is still with me even though he s a grumpy old man i have another rescue bun too and i love her to pieces but i ve never met a rabbit like george
that s amazing sounds like she lived a great life with you
one keeshond two keeshonden though a keeshond is a dutch name kees charles hond dog
that s an incredible story on a similar note we dropped off our very anxious cat to a cat hotel for the first time recently he only stayed two days but after he got home he was noticeably more affectionate he was terrified of his stay there so after he realized he was home and we were there he sought out more cuddles and we could tell he was just happy to be home it s amazing when they show just how much they miss us we re the lucky ones
i think the dog reset it s life when she fainted at age
i don t know enough to disagree so let s go with this
if they could verify it she would be th on the guinness list for oldest dogs
woah years i believe that s long enough to get a guiness world record certification
my cat lived till it isn t really common but it does happen
op probably meant in a half years old cause op said our years not theirs meaning human years not dog years
considering there are only recorded instances of a dog living to or above seems a bit unlikely
thats a husky for ya they love you more than anyone on the planet unless someone nearby has some cheese
one sandwich for my daughter one for me one for my hairy kid one fo wait
i love how the old man in the background took whole hours to figure out how to video on his phone
i didn t notice the food i thought she had suddenly turned into a cat
aww congratulations he‚Äôs a gorgeous pup just looking at those pictures shows he‚Äôs very much loved
good on you for anticipating the costs and thinking it through
your responsible approach makes me as happy as your puppy s comically oversized melon i ve never seen a cuter pup
you sound like a responsible pet owner congrats on the adorable pup
this i have a savings account for my cat i have my food budget for the month and her food budget the hardest thing to see on the internet is when people‚Äôs pets have an emergency and are afraid they cannot afford treatment
you re awesome more people should be as responsible when thinking about owning a pet it should not be a frivolous decision
i was hoping you weren‚Äôt ‚Äúsaving up‚Äù to get a pet from a breeder or farm ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
how does a week old puppy get to be owned by people whose apartment doesn t allow pets seems like a cover for backyard breeding tbh i m guessing there was a hefty rehoming fee
so what you re saying is that you saved up to commit to pet for its lifetime good on you op everyone should do this i see waaaaay to many posts on my pet forums that ask for veterinary advice for their pet that they can do at home because they cannot afford to take it to the vet it really sickens me pets cost money a lot of money throughout their lives as you just explained also i put aside extra for every pet i have for a potential in home euthanasia with cremation before i commit to that pet it s a morbib thought but in reality we usually outlive out pets when their time comes i want my decision to be what s best for the comfort of the pet not at all what i can afford sounds like a lot compared to the compounding cost a pet aquires over a lifetime a small drop in the bucket where i live us and my specific city has a few vets that will come to your home and offer this difficult service and take your per to the crematorium this is a wonderful option for three reasons my pet is at that point and a travel is stressfull and possibly painfull i think we all would preffer to pass at home vs a hospital human or animal our last memory is desired where we are happiest it s more intimate and doesn t feel clinical i can greive and cry as long as i want in anyway i choose i do not have to deal with the logitics of transporting my pet to the vet and or the crematorium i can just greive and not have to focus on driving well worth the extra money in my opinion to reel this back into happy times though your pupper is amazing you are amazing you both have such great times ahead of you i hope you update us with videos of him knocking that big head into every thing he will grow into it and smile so m ch along the way he s beautiful and yoy are beautiful for responsibly adopting him
extremely responsible and you are going to be an awesome pet parent
i d really recommend health insurance for your pup we pay about au a year for our guy and it s really easy how easily they can get themselves into expensive trouble for example my wife was throwing sticks for the dog and he jumped on it as it was bouncing off the ground it went down his throat and it cost au to get it out of him and for all the various medications afterwards the insurance paid au back to us amp x b another more recent example is for a bout of kennel cough he picked up he was coughing so bad he was throwing up taking him to the emergency vet cost us about au and we got au back amp x b imagine how much it would cost for something properly serious my friend paid about au for medication to give his dog months more life after a cancer diagnosis dogs aren t expensive until they are
love how you saved up i know dogs can be expensive you‚Äôre going to be a great pup parent
classic backyard breeder tactic you wanted a designer dog and you got one at the poor mothers expense
gt i was saving up for future costs including initial toy and treat purchases vaccinations vet check ups and emergencies don‚Äôt forget to include property replacement with those costs i think i‚Äôve bought more pairs of shoes than my wife since we got our pup last june she‚Äôs still a good girl though
right the nose is kinda cute in a nosey dog kinda way and then eye is like something you d see looking back at you through the peep hole of the door
kinda smart too but then again i really don t give dogs nearly enough credit for being smart
at first i thought it was op then i realised it was the dog and i shided myself
omg yes if i see that and didn t know there was a dog on the other side i would most likely scream faint
just gonna give it a quick smell smell and then a sly peek peek
that reminds me of the last few episodes of made in abyss even more horrifying when you learned who that eye belonged to and why it was constantly crying
i m could be my dog she is mostly white so it looks pretty pink around her eyes but she also sometimes has allergies and it gets really red
seriously i feel really unsettled looking at that portion of the picture
there s something not right about that eye it s the same size as the nose it s waaaay too big to be from the same animal looks shopped
yeah is it just me or does it look way to big to belong to that nose
i thought it was a human eye like the eye of a serial killer
my mom taught me this sing when i was a kid i randomly got it stuck in my head like a week ago and i ve been driving my husband nuts because i keep randomly singing it üòÇ
are you as old as me i learned this song in grade three we had songbooks and sang along to a scratchy rpm record somebody had to go to the library and get the record player that was in a heavy gray suitcase like carrier
i remember this song it s been so long i had forgotten it had existed in the first place
i love this song from when i was a little but had forgotten half the words thanks now i can sing it to my kid haha
thank you i hadn t heard that since i was a kid the meow meow meow parts crack me up haha
i‚Äôve never heard that song before and as with a lot of kid songs that is some dark shit poor don gato üò¢
were you born in the mid to late s i remember that song
i remember learning this song in like but a bunch of people are saying that they learned it a long time ago i guess it was just because of my sub who had a guitar and would sing various songs to all the children
yep i had a teacher who would bring out a guitar to sing the song with us we d also sing it in spanish for halloween she d dress up as a cat and sing the song
oh lord that was a flashback to third grade that i was not expecting
reddit formatting tip if you want to start a new line without a wide gap then leave two spaces before starting the next line like this and this and this
type two spaces at the end of the line before you hit return that will give you the single spaced look you seek
did they ever spray you how quick are they to use that as a defense
baby fart squirrels is pretty high up there on my cute o meter
just out of curiosity though can you have their glands removed like ferrets
do you still work there can you elaborate a little bit more on your experience seems super interesting
important question did you hold her tail so she could clean it this is a test i perform with every foster kitten i raise to see if they are a cat
was it that woman that i m always seeing on tv after my kid watches wild kratts
as someone that is curious about working at an animal rehab centre or something similar what s it like do you do work like this often did you have to have any special experience to start i ve always been curious and i d love to hear your experience
would it be better to not handle them so they stay somewhat wild
totally awesome they are so cute at that age it can be heart breaking to see them go but you always feel so proud most especially if you get to see them some time afterwards i ve seen a few of my patients after release sometimes years later if their injuries gave them a distinct look one of the best feelings
just to add to this if you are playing with your greyhound in a fenced in area they like to play a game they will run straight at you as fast as dogly possible and try to zoom past you while getting as close to you as they can just stay still they are very good at just brushing against you but only if you stay still trust me a greyhound skull to the kneecap at miles and hour is not as much fun as it sounds
the is the best most thorough and most accurate dog advice i‚Äôve seen on here
and watch out for that tail especially kids at tail height essentially an all bone whip
i ve been told that unless you re an olympic caliber runner don t try running with a greyhound i ve also read that greyhounds need sunscreen if they spend a lot of time outdoors they re great dogs though and ex racers come pre trained which is awesome for lazy people like me who like dogs but don t want to be bothered with teaching them manners
you mentioned the renaissance festival are you in co by chance our rescue group always has a booth at the festival
thank you i ve done a lot of research already but i dont think you can ever do too much when it comes to getting a dog
do all greyhounds do the roaching thing my best friend had two when we were growing up and floosie i know they thought it was hilarious their adopted ex racer would always sleep on her back with her legs straight up also would never leave the couch ever
do they need to run as part of their excercise our park is great but its open country with lots of squirrels cats chaseable dogs so there s not really scope for letting them ever off the leash but i see other people do that
i remember i was researching adopting a dog and looking for one that would match my mainly sedentary outside of the gym tbh lifestyle and i was really surprised to see that greyhounds were near the top of the list for lazy people please correct me if what i read was wrong but what the sites basically said was they like to run and will go ham but don t really care if they can t and will sit on a couch forever if you let them the site was comparing them to other dogs that will get anxious or hostile or start chewing on things if not walked regularly or exercised do you agree with that
add to this because of heavy protein diets when racing and very little tooth care beyond hyper critical to take care of their teeth common tooth and gum disease they can develop a bacteria that damages kidneys and pancreas lost ours because of this and it was crushing
do they need a lot of exercise given their previous job how come a lot of greyhound owners describe their pets as lazy bones i would think they would be very active all the time also how do you exercise them if you need to keep them on a leash all the time nvm i forgot about dog parks
i know this is pretty common knowledge but just to reiterate it s hilarious how lazy grey hounds are they re insanely fast but inside with access to couch they love passing out i love it
that was tips not and you labeled them haha bit tired are we
i‚Äôve heard from my gf vet tech at clinic that greyhounds are laughably sensitive to pain like she‚Äôs said that there‚Äôs virtually no difference in their howling from a splinter to broken bones
if you re interested in seeing how to adopt a former racing greyhound check out jenna marbles s videos on her new greyhound bunny they re doing a great job with her while bunny didn t race she still came from the racing life so it s pretty much the same experience having to desensitize her and introduce her to new things and new behavior jenna also already has dogs so it s a good way to observe how she incorporates a new greyhound to her pack
there is one other thing that i will add to this muzzle them when you let them off lead they will be used to a spacious box muzzle and it removes any anxiety that you have if they do start chasing something they won t mind it at all and one other thing the greys that i have had too many to count have all been pretty good for recall so you do not necessarily need a completely fenced in area once you have got your bearings a big field or countryside walk should be fine however i would never off lead a grey in an urban area just in case
wow roaching i didn t know that was a common thing my old golden used to do it up against out sliding glass door very informative they sound like fantastic dogs even coming from a non dog person
if your house has stairs you might need to train your rescue greyhound about how to ascend and descend they‚Äôre really good at running super fast on a level surface but often have never encountered inclines before i had to literally hold our rescue greyhound between my knees and lift it up the stairs paw by paw and they can‚Äôt eat off the ground they‚Äôre tall and long with delicate digestive systems that get scrunched up if they try so you need to get them a raised food bowl
be careful putting a retired racing greyhound in a house with any small animals like a cat they train them to run by using a small furry thing they chase around the track so they might think cats in the house are prey i would recommend against adopting a racing greathouse with cats or small animals doesn t mean it s every greyhound but that s how they were trained to run a lot of rescues won t adopt them out to you if you have any other animals like a cat
to that first point i lived out in the country and the neighbors had a retired greyhound named scootcher their property was mostly surrounded by woods and farmland there was just a bush trail between our properties they didn t have a fence so a few times a month i d look out and see scootcher sprinting around our yard and i d go out run him around a bit to try and tire him out and then walk him back home i don t think scootcher ever intended to come to our house i think he usually just got running and ended up there now that i m typing this they re basically forest gump the dog
from other things i ve read aren t they also prone to bleeding infections from what seem like small cuts i ve never owned but i ve gotten the impression that if they get anything more than a scrape you need to look at it and decide if it needs treatment since their skin is quite thin i could be completely wrong and please correct me if i am
i‚Äôve heard they‚Äôre fragile like not made of glass but more prone to breaking a bone by knocking over a chair on themselves
some greys can nip while waking up from sleep as well like a panic start just leep that in mind too
no joke he looks like a combination of cheech and chong
i like your comment but i had to downvote it to get you back to the strongest wills
ah shit i was gonna say skinny santa but yours is better
welp this guy got here first everyone we all saw it from there it was a footrace
i was gonna be pissed if this wasn‚Äôt the top comment
this guys doesn t have the tattoo on his right bicep and doesn t show signs of having one removed but yeah holy shit the resemblance is incredible
he looks like tommy chong and anthony hopkins had a love child
i literally just asked this without reading the comments
that s what you get when you move kevin greyhound probably
i used to be an adventurer like you then i took a greyhound to the knee
my great dane plays this game only he s not that good at brushing past me and tends to barrel into me at full speed it s adorable and painful
the first time i took my hound to the dog park he ran full tilt at a mob of dogs they didn t get out of the way so he just jumped over them and kept going
is this a specific greyhound thing my mutt loves to do this i ve learned not to move she s a much better judge on collision than i am haha she loves to runs and has a really tiny waist we ve always debated between whippet and greyhound
my whippet does this too as a puppy he was really bad at the whole not crashing into my legs thing now he s pretty good at it when he wants to be
so basically they like to play chicken but just know they re gunna change direction first
i thought i had outwitted mine and stood by a tree damn beast squeezed through the gap at full speed once he actually barrelled me over the grass wasn t as grippy as he expected and he slid ass over teakettle into my shins i love that dog but sometimes it really sucks that he s just a sack of bones going really fast
this is exactly what one would say if they were related to someone famous
he could probably make some express money as a celebrity impersonator
it‚Äôs time we tell you the truth about your father crachmilson
it can help if you back away if you keep facing them they often posture but don t attack turn our back and the last thing you hear is one stomping up to bite
yea i took a picture of some geese with goslings and daddy goose was about to fuck up my day
trains are super easy to avoid actually just stay away from their tracks and they rarely attack
yeah i returned a gosling once and the father ran at me hissing he wasn‚Äôt that grateful
depends if the geese were familiar with him can be pretty chill source used to feed geese on my lunch break at the office years ago they still remember and seem to like me
that‚Äôs hilarious makes you wonder what‚Äôs going through their heads is it a fear thing that they just need enough motivation to overcome or was he straight up trolling you
gt guess who comes rolling in at am soaking wet tired and hungry with branches hanging off everywhere the arborist
man for a second there i was wondering what an abortionist does for cats in trees
if i take you to the hospital you wont learn anything
i live in hawaii and lost my cat for like five days and heard faintly meowing one night i never though i‚Äôd see him again
omg you made me laugh i shared this with my spouse and my cat they were amused as well the cat less so of course
i‚Äôm glad to know that i‚Äôm not the only person who has serious discussions with their cats i had to sit my oldest down and have a serious talk with him because the kittens are influencing him to misbehave and i‚Äôm not having any of it
i love it s not that he doesn t see any kitten skeletons in trees rather just i don t see many it s confirmed op has seen at least one kitten skeleton in a tree
i ve rescued a cat from a tree it was easy threw a rope over the branch lined a laundry basket with a blanket and put some food in the bottom raised the basket up to the level of the branch it took the cat about minutes to decide the blanket and food was a better option than the branch as soon as he went in we lowered him down
you did good üòÄ i used to wheedle the volunteer fire department to come rescue her the second time they had a very effective small hose never happened again
my dad just got a ft pipe and ft of cable and made a ft noose arm looping the cable through the pipe and grabbed his dumb ass off the tree by the neck plopped him on the ground and said he s not likely to do that again
the best part about this story is that i m always talking like this to my cats i talk to them like they are my kids whats really confusing for my neighbors they were really afraid when i told my son to just jump down from the garage or there will be no dinner for him
i work at a university in canada that occasionally has geese living on or just off campus i m also on the campus safety committee it s hilarious how much time is spent sometimes discussing geese attacking students staff and faculty and how to manage them during events like an open house so guests don t get attacked
i see a lot of people saying this but i‚Äôve never had geese come after me and as a kid i messed with them a lot i‚Äôm of course much more respectful of wildlife now but i‚Äôve only ever seen them run away when you get too close except with offspring then they just hiss while ushering the babies back
my sibling used to chase canadian geese for fun when they were only a few feet tall fucking fearless i don‚Äôt trust those dinosaur looking fucks
the geese showed their appreciation by not attacking him and eating his face
these things really attack and hurt severely someone school me because i had no idea i remember running away for dear life from one when i was a kid
why can t you just kick them or chase them with a stick
how does a goose injure you i‚Äôve always just chased them back whenever they came at me they would run away after that never thought they would be able to seriously injure me if i couldn‚Äôt be imposing enough
they re aggressive we have them here during some season but i ve never interacted with them to know
you got a problem with canadain gooses you got a problem with me and i suggest you let that one marinate
if you have a problem with canada gooses you have a problem with me and i suggest you get that one marinate
thank you it s always time to learn something new i don t have awards but you should have one

gt back then superheroes weren t exactly as overpowered quite apart from the end of this post i have to dispute this amp x b seems like primetime for superman and he is basically invincible and all powerful unless you have the special glowing green stone
i immediately suspected it was gonna be shittymorph looked at the username comfirmed it wasn‚Äôt shittymorph let out a sigh of relief proceeded to read on and still got hell in a celled wtf
don t you dare use a cat post to spread your imposter syndrome
when you start it off with fun fact i automatically look at the last sentence
i got to the line with sonic then went to make you you weren shittymorph or guywithrealfacts then finished it so uh fuck you i guess
would you care to elaborate on some of the incidents that have occurred from said geese
i would suggest hiring some dogs my school hired they lived with one of the staff who trained them and would run around campus scaring off geese we had a pond no one was attacked
we have geese lurking where i live but try kayaking near swans they are super mean
i remember nipissing university had a stupid amount of geese although mcmaster definitely has them beat in certain areas on campus
university of manitoba there s signs that say to watch out for geese for all cars driving in
i used to go to universities in canada in a prior job one campus out west had an entire area between buildings each building was joined to the others on either side of it with a big open air quadrangle in the middle cordoned off because canada geese were there and would attack anyone who tried to cut through the middle i remember having to ask whether the sign saying don t go outside because of the geese was a piss take or not am australian and it was the first time i d been to that campus seen angry geese
so weird cuz i fed some of them on the beach and i didn t get attacked they did attack each other tho
so i went to a crap school that had two resident swans i was trapped on a bridge over the large pond in the middle of campus for over an hour in late october because of those assholes it s a fine for touching the jerks and no one could get them to move and let me through one on each end of the bridge my programming professor came out with the class since he didn t believe my friend i called and told i was stuck even campus safety couldn t get them to gtfo i was very happy when a few years later they were sold and no longer on campus those damn birds were a nightmare and caused a lot of stress for students and the grounds crew btw i got freed by one of the grounds team members bringing one of the huge nets they use to clean the pond poking at the swan until it got irritated and chased after him he proceeded to hop onto a waiting maintenance vehicle and ride away i baked the grounds crew cookies many times after this their favorite were my gingerbread swans those were and still are often requested
don t mean to dox you but i know this is york university
mine just sits out the window and dosen t enjoy shit kinda wish i had a bond with him but no
all about luck and socializing my cat has never bit scratched or hissed she s my snuggle buddy
mine is basically snuggled to me most of the day we are about to go on vacation for a week and while she will have a wonderful petsitter she will be sad and so will i
mine used to snuggle with her butt by my head i miss my puddy cat
i mean i wouldn‚Äôt trust all people that close to my face either depends on the cat my cat snuggles like this daily of her own accord we never taught her to do it she just feels entitled to sleep wherever and on whoever she likes
do you play with your cat regularly every day followed by mealtime does your cat have any spaces to call its own cat trees window shelves cat walks every cat is different but a secure cat isn t likely to lash out without warning they are also very good at reading your body language most animals are if you feel scared they pick up on that and react the best thing you can do is associate yourself with awesome things like food treats and lots of play
i guess i ve been lucky i ve had three cats throughout my life and none have ever tried to bite or scratch me even when scared i don t even know what to do with a cat that does that
i raised mine since he was born and studied cat behavior i only ever get scratched or bitten either accidentally or by my own damned fault e g ignoring body language or not paying attention a cat‚Äôs tameness depends on their interactions with humans during their first eight weeks of life separation from their mothers too early can mess them up too and of course treat them well and particularly treat them like they are cats not like dogs or human babies because if you‚Äôre cruel or don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing you‚Äôll reap what you sow ferals can be sweet with patience knowledge and work
mine is selfish and untouchable sometimes but there are times when she want some love and i can see her mood she will never bite or scratch in you don t force her to snuggle well she won t scratch even if you force her but not for long
my girlfriends cat is the chillest cat i ve met in person i m her favorite and ik this because she let s me pick her up and pirate carry her around she doesn t bite me if she doesn t like me doing something just slowly and gently nibbles me and if i m ever just chilling she ll get on me and just nap
luck mainly also doing doing research on breed and teaching your cat good behaviors
cats are a bit different but they generally notice when you try it takes a while to gain some cats trust but when you do they melt
mine wanders around and howls until i pick him up then he makes himself cozy on my chest forcing me to carry around lbs of fur like an awkward parrot until my arms shoulders get sore
i hesitate to mention because nothing is confirmed one way or another but you might wanna be careful about morgan freeman
put two spaces at the end of your lines to make them show separately
i feel like you may be missing bob ross and fred rogers here
the man s name is nick offerman who played ron swanson although from what i ve seen of his interviews and other roles he wasn t acting to play ron swanson
if the month is nov oct then on somebodies dinner plate
this is a leak from the new live action bambi movie
out grazing but she s going to be really pissed off when she comes back and s he s not where she left them i ve told you a million times don t run off
i dunno his voice makes me think he s old enough to be out on his own
my first thought does op carry enough pokeballs when walking in near tall grass
does often leave their children alone in a hidden place the tall grass while looking for food the young deer can‚Äôt run fast enough to get away from predators so if there are any where the doe is she can run away easily
i saw that screen cap yesterday of a person who relocated a fawn that was in their yard now i m just super worried that this is the same baby and instead of where is your mother being my first thought this poor thing is like i m lost where is my mother are you my mother now
my first thought bambi nooo my yo loves bambi i ve read it hundreds of times
gt a little back story i saw mom on the way over what i didn t see was this little guy so no he s not an orphan mom ran off and after this video happened i didn t think it was a good idea to hang around i am going to go back today and make sure mom did come back i will bring some food with me
man do you just visit the farm and play with all the animals and get fat from your grandma feeding you cause that‚Äôs what i‚Äôd do if i had grandparents that lived on a farm
showed up on a farm out of nowhere and just stayed i think ted may have a dark past that he‚Äôs running from
i am the cat who used to roam a wanderer alone but now i ve found a place called home a family of my own i didn t think i d wanna be tied down to just one place these human frens they needed me n they give me my space so i adopt them all is good i like it here instead i never thought i really would be more than cat i m ted ‚ù§Ô∏è
writing prompt your family secretly owns the farm upstate where all pets go when they die
that‚Äôs how i got both my cats just showed up and never left
ted sounds beautiful i wish him lives over and more
its great he found a home but his story is almost certain that his previous owner decided they didnt want him anymore and drove out to the country and left him there he s lucky many house cats just don t really know how to survive alone and end up becoming prey most farmers i know have a soft spot for cats and take them in source i used to spend a ton of time on a family farm and it was often a new non feral cat would just show up
my pap also lived on his old farm and same thing happened two cats showed up but only one stayed a black tuxedo the sweetest fucking cat i ve ever known all the kids wanted to name him something like boots or socks he had white feet but pap was like nah that s fred fred would come and go as he pleased he had his own food bowl and bed in their garage and slept in the garage or the old barn if it was cold killed lots of chipmunks which made pap happy and left the guts on the porch patio for gram which she didn t love as much he was such a sweetheart too he loved to sit in your lap and drool on you nibbling toes was also a favorite of his poor guy died a few years ago he kept getting tumors on his back shoulder which my dad veterinarian would operate on him for cat was tough as nails the tumors didn t do him in it was some sort of respiratory issue that did him in finally i believe i still miss the fuck out of that cat
so you build a farm and the animals just come there i thought you had to buy the animals
that is how my grandma got her cat lived on a farm one day an orange tabby showed up and never left
i see this so often and so many owners seem to be completely oblivious to it until it‚Äôs too late i wish it was more widely known among dog owners
thanks for mentioning it it s definitely not aww to get two puppies and only people who really know what they are in for should consider it at all
gt before i say more i should add that i‚Äôve looked and asked around for any research on this issue and haven‚Äôt found a thing that supports or disputes what some people call ‚Äúlitter mate syndrome ‚Äù if you are aware of any good research please let us all know what i‚Äôm writing here is based on my experience and the anecdotes of others i‚Äôd love it if someday someone did some good research on this to see if our beliefs are well founded so it could all be bs
gt what i‚Äôm writing here is based on my experience and the anecdotes of others i‚Äôd love it if someday someone did some good research on this to see if our beliefs are well founded doesn t seem to be that well documented tho
the writer based it on their own experience and anecdotes they even say there is no actual research
always got two at a time and never had these troubles
so uhh my dogs are best friends maybe they like eachother more than me oh well we all still get along great
nah not even verified as a ‚Äúreal‚Äù issue you only hear about the bad not the good we‚Äôve no clue how many pairs of pups have been purchased or adopted at the same time and have not had any problems because when there aren‚Äôt problems there aren‚Äôt reports i purchased two hound pups littermates years ago violated every rule that is supposed to prevent ‚Äúlittermate syndrome ‚Äù and have not had any ‚Äúlittermate syndrome‚Äù issues ‚Äúlittermate syndrome‚Äù is more likely a result of poor pet ownership and not being prepared for the trouble that two puppies can cause without giving it much thought i said ‚Äúhow much more difficult can two be compared to one ‚Äù i was in for a surprise unexpectedly they didn‚Äôt want to do anything at the same time let‚Äôs go potty guys nope one would go potty one would play in the grass one wanted to nap one wanted to eat a shoe being a rational human i could deal with this adversity in a rational way and not resort to making up an entire syndrome to shift the responsibility of my inability to raise a couple of puppies onto the puppies ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
immediately thought the lips looked like mr bone from doug
i had to zoom in to understand what was happening there
i honestly thought man that cat has some fucked up lips
not just lips but weird stretched out sex doll lips super disturbing

woot this is great seriously this is ogden nash level talent here boys
a strong wind sway the clouds are grey what is this life anyway a foul scent is in the air all is despair as true as my fur is white like snow the world is dark this i know invisible i canno see oh wait my eyes are closed hee hee
i sense snacks we must gets back quickly now lay tracks
you could sing these lyrics to the tune of the firefly intro song and it would match perfectly
i have this turned into a song stuck in my noggin üòä
work towards becoming veganüòä it‚Äôs easier than you would think it‚Äôs the best decision i‚Äôve ever made in my life
and thats exactly whats wrong with todays society thinking that eating meat is a sin you re so wrong
don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre an asshole but if you do feel bad about it eat less of it
dude i know how you felt i went vegan in and honestly i haven t had any issues and feel great all the time if you want to try it out i suggest doing meatless mondays and slowly work your way to excluding it from every meal each day you d be surprised on how you ll feel and look after to months of doing that
you re not an asshole it s good that you want to think about these kinds of things and try to look at your own values it s never too late to change anyways
i feel that same like i may as well be eating a dog because the cow looks just the same makes it hit home
i m going vegetarian for environmental reasons mostly but clips like these really strengthens my commitment
stop eating meat then go vegan you are a complete asshole buying meat directly funds animal abuse and those cows are exactly the same as this cute guy they both want to live üíï
the fact you ve come to this realisation is a great step it s not easy to question what you ve been taught fed all your life going vegan is so much easier now i kept thinking about it this way every time i bought an animal product i was condemning an animal to die amp x b i hated feeling like that so i cut out all animal products from my diet and lifestyle
am i the only one who feels totally ok with eating meat and loving animals at the same time
imho groups pushing for less meat consumption needs to be focusing on these kind of clips telling people to reduce eating meat because its mistreating animals has effect on people who have been raised to see them as just a food product a ton of people have been told their entire life that these animals are too stupid care about their own well being
ha i caught on as soon as i read the first sentence i no longer fall for your facts
yup this is why i reddit to get cold hard facts that save lives
you speak with such confidence that even though i know you‚Äôre wrong i want to believe that you‚Äôre right
reads first paragraph lol i haven‚Äôt grown and i yawn shake all the time guess it‚Äôs a weird thing left ov reads comments checks username oh i‚Äôve been had again by the guy with real fake facts reads rest of op i should really stop skimming comments
gt kittens if they ever learn to purr indefinitely and not sleep all day could grow to be giants at will and take over the world why am i not afraid of this outcome
ah so this explains clifford the big red dog but why was he red then
garbage novelty account i would think differently if i didn‚Äôt catch you within the first sentence every time you need to up your game i don‚Äôt hate the concept of your account just your shit execution you make it too obvious u shittymorph almost always has me going until the very end because he‚Äôs actually good at what he does
does it mean that babies should be put it well aired or oxygenated rooms i read somewhere on reddit that in scandacian countries they put babies outside maybe that is reason of them being big n tall
so what your saying is put a chihuahua puppy next to a kitten and just doom us all
about half way through this i had a feeling i was going to get shittymorph d this was a nice twist
did anyone else check for u shittymorph i m scarred and forever changed due to their antics
you had me until about halfway through the third paragraph
god dammit lol i even knew it sounded like some really random ass info to know and once i got to never put a puppy on a vibrating bed or next to a purring kitten is when i knew for sure f
you just made me realize i haven t gotten nailed by that mankind hell in a cell guy in months
damn you got me good literally was buying everything you were saying until the part about elephants
you just singled handedly explained my neighbor s elephant sized backyard chihuahua
what i truly love about your posts is that they start out so convincingly with great aplomb and specific details and then slowly just slowly suckerpunch us
make sense so the evil overlords with purring cats on their laps are on to something
i‚Äòve seen you on here before i always learn something interesting from you but then right after i think that it was all bullshit
i think i m grown f but this still happens to me my limbs tremble when i yawn am i dying hypochondriac signing out
there you are was just thinking earlier i haven t learned any real animal facts in a while
i m embarrassed about how far i got into this before i questioned it s validity
you had me completely bamboozled until the bit about the elephants
wtf i yawn quiver all the time continues reading oh fucking damn it
i feel really accomplished i caught this in the first part of the nd paragraph lol
challenge accepted immediately puts great dane puppy on vibrating bed
the size of elephants huh that must be hard on the floors of their owner‚Äôs home
legend has it that kittays don t just purr when happy they also purr when injured average hz of said kittay vibration is typically between which according to physiology is said to increase muscle and tissue generation
nice to see you again it s taking less time to check for your username
or let it lie next to a purring kitten to lie as in lie down is not the same verb as to lay lay requires an object i lie next to him i lie on the banks of the marne i was lying on the beach i lay in the sun all day i was sunburned i lay the sheet music on the klavier she is laying the kimono on the sofa i laid the box of godiva truffles near the math journals on the desk
gt elephants was buying into this until you mentioned elephants
same for my cat super dramatic meowing towards everyone in the household except for me the person who feeds him
that s a good idea our issue is our dog begs for treats whenever we open our freezer drawer we should have one for that
i used to feed my cats from an auto dispenser so they never really seemed to closely connect me with food now that my oldest pain in the butt only eats canned food i get two hours every morning of him walking around on top of me and howling am to am like clockwork
my daughter and three roommates had this for her cat he had gotten pretty fat
we just started summer break i‚Äôm lucky if my teenagers get up before noon
they learned people would feed them when they wake up next step is to wake them up themselves by cuddles one by one
my friends dog started to look like a plump little smokey before we noticed she was getting breakfast and a dinner
my childhood cat left us and moved in with our neighbors because they fed it canned tuna
that‚Äôs a good idea our cat coco can get six cans of wet food before noon if people wake up at different times she‚Äôs still skinny as a rail though meanwhile mittens gets half a cup of dry food a day and weighs like pounds probably need to give mittens all the thyroid hormone coco is making is my guess
you can enjoy the video and still enjoy eating meat just like you don t want children amp people in general working around toxic metals with no protection that get paid next to nothing but you still have a cell phone or a computer or make use of them reducing your footprint is a good goal but it doesn t save any animals lives they re still being killed and sent to market all the same just more of the meat is being thrown away instead of bought making change is good but acknowledging the reality of the situation is important too
same i want to be vegan one day for both ethical and environmental reasons i ve cut out red meat and i m working towards cutting out lean meat as well i m trying but clips like these make me feel like a huge asshole for ever eating meat
i don t know if i would agree seems like he accomplished his task at hand all while being autonomous and low maintenance for his partner plus super cute so automatic pass
i am the dog the job is mine i know am gonna do so fine we on the tail of suspect perp important i not act like derp so unsuspect we act aloof is time to play with tail floof is just a ploy am do distract security we keep intact no terrierist will we let thru i ll chase my tail n catch them too but really we have eye on you
first rule of detective work is every one is suspect even your oen tail
let s be real there s a reason goldens aren t the number one security services dog breed
the dog is indirectly saying if i can catch my tail i can sure as hell catch you
i once saw a bobcat on top of a neighbor‚Äôs chicken coop
all kitties are kitties regardless of size the difference between a tabby and a tiger is that one can actually eat you
yea it‚Äôs pretty cool they go up for a lot of money too op if you want i can show you a guy that knows what to do with these felines one thing the chinese people like is their teeth for medicine they‚Äôll sell them for a pop crazy i know if you want to capture them you have to grab them by the neck this will paralyze them and you put them in a wool bag wich will get them tight i don‚Äôt know where you live but i can find someone from my experience the younger the better because there mussels aren‚Äôt ripe yet
they act so much like house kittens me my brother and my mom took in sibling kittens because their mom abandoned them after trying to kill them because they had eye infections and weren t gonna make it if me didn t take them in but today all are healthy big cats
expecting mama cat to roar like a majestic tiger i m disappointed still cute though
i yell at my cat the same way when he gets on the counter if my translation is accurate she is saying ‚Äúget the fuck down from there you little bastard ‚Äù
thanks just curious to know where baby bobcats roam freely among the rooftops
in tucson too that is awesome we just get noisy coyotes in the middle of the night
are these sorts of roofs common up there is it good for reflecting heat or keeping the house cool or something how do you keep it clean not bobcat free but like getting leaves and dirt out of the way etc
i was going to ask because the surrounding houses and roofs look a lot like the ones in my neighborhood
that is really similar to the architecture i have seen in india if it was not for the bobcats i thought this would have been in india
reddit is so strange sometimes i lived in tucson for a while
called it looks like north west side maybe silverbell area
everytime i hear or read tucson arizona i can t help but get the eagles stuck in my head
i thought you were from there when you mentioned the guy picking up the kitten hello fellow tucsonan
shoutout i had bobcats living on my roof when i was a kid lol
i ve never been to az but about seconds into the video i thought this just be arizona
i knew it had to be az there was a couple videos of baby bobs in carefree recently hello fellow az redditor thank you for sharing the wildlife here is pretty spectacular
eyyyy fellow tucsonan we get bobcats in my dad s backyard every year as well the babies are so cute
that was my first guess i was there for a business trip recently and had no idea what i was in for i loved it
jojo never knew what he was missing when he left his home
i knew this was either phoenix or tucson from the rooftop and house colors
how do you like tucson the bobcats alone are selling me
as soon as i saw this i wondered if it was tucson i love living in tucson my apartment complex has a resident bobcat mama and i finally caught a glimpse of her a few weeks ago she s a big girl the area in and around my complex seems to be a wildlife highway javelinas follow the fenceline on one side and occasionally roam around farther in to the desert and there is a coyote pack that has a nightly howl and scamper to the desert along the other fenceline
i thought so just because of the roof i lived there for a couple years and we‚Äôd get packs of javelina running through our property lol love that city
i meant exact address also need your name social security number a visa card security code and expiration date and hulu account
i knew it i grew up in tucson and we used to have a mom and her babies play in our tree
i knew you were in the old pueblo based on your roof shingles and the bobcats
my house in tucson has the exact same roof and the second i opened the video i knew it that s awesome
i live there too great to see another tusconan on reddit
pretty easy to recognize your in az just from the roof dusty check tiled roof check you can feel the heat through the picture check yup you‚Äôre an arizonan
i m so jealous pittsburgh sucks it rains most days and when it s not raining it s cold when it s not cold you are sweating your ass off because of the humidity we get like days of sunshine if lucky
no way i live in tucson and this is exactly what i‚Äôd expect lol tucson‚Äôs a strange and beautiful place
moving here for grad school in january d i am excited to see bobcats
i knew it the roof gave it away and ya know the bobcat
i could immediately tell by the roof that this was az
that looks like it s up north we have the same thing on the east side by drexel landfill
i fucking knew it was az just based off the roofing
y all get cool animals like cute little bobcats foxes and javalenas while i get the occasional meth head trying to steal my amazon packages and scorpions fyi i live in phoenix
what i live in tucson as well and nothing cool like this ever happens at my house
i swear i recognized the roofing pattern holy crap you might even live near my neighborhood
i literally knew this was tucson the minute i saw this
i could have told you that you lived in arizona at least by our ugly ass roof s and houses that look all the same lol
i also live in tucson az i am your and your bobcat family‚Äôs friend now
omg i am about to move there yes i will be looking for this bobcat feature as well
my aunt lives in tucson az she just lost a beloved pygmy goat to a bobcat on tuesday i m going to go ahead and imagine that it was because of your bobcats so i can t feel a little better
i figured this had to be tucson do you live in the foothills
yoo i live in az as well and tbh it could either be a bobcat or coyotes there coyotes are everywhere in az you can literally see them walk down the street
wait this is in tucson i m coming down from phx asap lol i wanna see this dumb question is the mama super defensive feral
i lived there for two years beautiful area we had coyotes walk around our neighborhood constantly though
you make a post and it gets awards and you post a comment and it gets gold too how the hell
i saw your video and thought hmm is this tucson i was surprised i was right haha i m moving there next month and can t wait
bob cats are so elusive in tucson at least for me it‚Äôs crazy you have a regular family breeding every year and at the same time raising their young in the same place
i also live in tucson my parents had bobcats in their yard last year they live out by casino del sol on an acre
after a full day of not being a bobcat i am now a bobcat
bobcats like being high i wonder if snoop dogg is actually a cat
can we see the cove from the angle the camera is facing now
have they ever been intrusive or aggressive by any means
but you re in a position to snag a kitten when they re near weaning age bobcats do make great pets if you get them young and socialized just like a housecat but pounds of dog intimidating fury to boot
bobcats like being up high bobcat tells her child to climb down from there he s too high up
i don t blame them i mean who doesn t like being high
i identify as a bobcat but my employer is hesitant to provide appropriate accommodation
i‚Äôm such a bobcat right now i have no idea what‚Äôs going on
dangit wanted to be a bobcat and accidentally ended up as a tomcat
gt til i m a bobcat giving birth on rooftops should be your right as an american i support you
i used tah be a bobcat i still do but i usedtah too
i think at least providing a water source nearby more for the mom i think no need to get too close would be ok being wild they should at least get their own food without humans but water can be tricky especially in the city where we don t have many ponds due to drainage systems
when you said every year in the title it makes it seem like its happened more than two years in a row
thanks for being such a great host to these guys i wish there were more people like you
i was going to remark on how small she was i live in the ozarks and they stay pretty hidden but i ve never seen an adult that small
did he get stitches from the kitten or the angry mom
gt so as much as they are adorable they are still wild and dangerous like a k pop band
where are you located thanks for posting awesome clip
you could try putting out pinecones or another natural item that could be played with by the kittens for some fun without real man made interference
just make sure when you return home you look above and below for an ambush and have a flashlight handy at night
i‚Äôm pretty sure balls and frisbees are native to roofs so you would not be interfering with their natural ways
i guess a ball is ok we had a nest with foxes and i just let a small ball laying around moma herself picked the ball up and gave it to the little ones ok we also gave them some scraps of food when it was just very cold and rainy for weeks
did the previous owner tell you that you have a bobcat nursery on your roof
that sounds pretty interesting op you should keep an eye out on it if it happens a third time you might want to ask if it s normal for bobcats to head to their birthplace for birthing their kits
gt also i dont want to do anything more then just put up a camera because i ve seen a few people suggest building a dog house or something but they are wild animals and needed to be treated as such and cant get used to humans thank you trying to interact with them or tame them would be the wrong thing to do let them stay wild and enjoy filming the next litter for years to come
i would love to see a toy up there but human made toys would have human scent on them i wouldn t put any water or food up there as it would habituate them to the area it s already kinda bad that they re living among humans cute but they re wild animals and the and killers of bobcats are cars and rat poison pinecones or something similar seems like a better idea
i was gonna guess florida then i read the part about the guy picking one up then i knew it was florida
a ball chuckit or even a kong type toy would not harm them nor would it make them more used to humans do not use a tennis ball or something that would break apart easily you wouldn‚Äôt even need to wash it or anything when you know they are not around put it up there and upload the video of course
one of my moms friends used to cross breed bobcats and housecats ‚Äúpixie bobs‚Äù as she called them those things were evil
d aww appreciate this and good ol mother nature thanks for sharing
the people suggesting building a dog house are idiots
she does look like a younger bobcat moms will sometimes give parts of their territories to their daughters so you could be right
omg a ball do it mama kitty is so gorgeous it hurts
if you live around st and shea in scottsdale az i know these cats
what does a bobcat giving birth on a roof sound like to the people under it
the guy who picked up the baby bobcat is lucky to be in one piece they can and do wreak havoc on much larger livestock and the aforementioned humans
your roof seems like such a safe place for a mama and her kittens lt so sweet
gt i have been super tempted to put up some kind of ball up there though lol oh man i m not sure i could resist
totally understand and respect your not wanting to intervene in any way but putting a ball up there has to be fine they re suburban bobcats they re going to come across various human artifacts such as balls in their lifetime
you are doing good in not interfering and treating them like pets let them live wild and free from human contact
you are responsible and informed about how to treat wildlife thank you
hang a ball and the little thing might get it wrapped around its neck on camera good job thanks
so if this is the same as last year it s basically a repost
you are so nice thank you so much for thinking this way lt
oh please put out a ball or a rope toy aaaah it would be great to see them play mom makes great sounds to say hey get back here lol
please consider cardboard fresh corrugated cardboard
can we get more than minute of it please i m thinking maybe several hours or just a feed all the time
a ball might be fun without crossing the line i saw a video of a fox playing with a dog toy left in someone‚Äôs yard
if you approach them slowly with some fish in your hand and right click on them then you might be able to tame them
so cute thank you being reasonable person a lot of crazy people would try to turn these guys into pets
when you say every year in the title do you know if this has happened before you moved in then
you re the hero they need and deserve good looking out
put a ball of yarn the largest and most ferocious of cats can t resist playing with it
you should definitely put a bedding treats toys i get that they are wildlife but as long as you re not directly interacting with them it s fine and btw they already used to human influences a house with a roof isn t wildlife
this is awesome take some snaps of the babies and maybe you‚Äôll notice the fur when they come next year as mamas
country folk chiming in do what your doing and don‚Äôt mess with the bobcats if you have any house cats it might be a problem but otherwise they will be great to have around your house bobcats are awesome
i was thinking of that ball with the camera in it pebby but idk maybe it s best to just let them be
i love that you respect that they are wild animals good for you op
my cat loved your video but he spent the whole time looking at the bird that was on the roof
i think if a ball ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù landed on your roof it would be ok
wow that s a rare privelige and good on you for respecting their right to be left alone i get really excited about the frogs that live in my pond i can only imagine this is just about as cool
you should consider live streaming it if it happens again
well dont balls occasionally end up on roofs like frisbees lol i would be so tempted too
i feel like i could hear boy get your ass down from there right now i had a flashback to my childhood lol
gt but they are wild animals and needed to be treated as such and cant get used to humans i fucking love you op
thank you for being a great person by accommodating them and not getting rid of them
i feel like a ball might be the perfect small addition haha can‚Äôt wait to see next years video
maybe at least put some water up there it‚Äôs been so warm the last couple days
wow super responsible totally support the ball idea though
they need a toy or something to play with it s like meowschwitz up there
i m not going to lie if i were you i would totally set it up for live stream as a conversation starter and just so i could look in on them whenever you definitely need to upload more videos so that my girlfriend has a reason to talk to me
i would twitch this absolutely its like watching a nature doc in real time d
would you ever consider putting down a softer surface like astroturf or something my brain isn‚Äôt working right now double shift at work today but i was just thinking maybe there‚Äôs something soft or grasslike
you re right dont build or do anything for them as they cannot rely on human resources to survive they have to be wild and figure survive out on their own it s just like not feeding deer dont fucking do it what a sweet thing u get to witness
gt if people are actually wanting me to livestream on twitch or something i can probably set that up um yes yes please remindme week
if this ends up a livestream please update this post
thank you for making it a point out that it‚Äôs important to not interact with wildlife unless absolutely necessary i love you for being a responsible person while also giving us some great bobcat footage
maybe you can put some pinecones up there and other nuts so that way they have something fun to play with that can find naturally in the wild all so please do a live stream
this is awesome please consider a youtube channel and livestream
it sounds like the grandmama kitty was smart to think that your roof cove is a safe space thank you for using your best judgement and keeping your distance as well as sharing these cuties with us hope to see more of them
i m glad the video was a minute long melted my heart
gt i have been super tempted to put up some kind of ball up there though lol this was my only thought would up the adorableness if possible seeing them play with a harmless cat toy
the mom is so tiny because she isn‚Äôt fully grown yet i‚Äôd assume you‚Äôll have more babies from the same mom next year this one is probably one of the kits from last year
i would love to view a livestream or atleast view more videos d
oh my god please throw a stuffy toy up there nothing with a squeaker though or you ll never sleep
i think yes to ‚Äúall‚Äù of your queries now proceed please
put a ball out is my knee jerk response to your comment but i do applaud you for showing restraint for not doing too much to get them too friendly with humans as a wild animal if you do put a ball or something out for them be sure to update us
you could accidentally toss one up and be like oh nnoooooo whatever shall i do lost for good now
down to help you with the lifestream set up will dm
please livestream it on twitch that would be amazing
thats fantastic dude just let them be and watch from a distance and everybody will be happy
edit your original posting with this info thank you for the amazing video and looking forward to the next ones
amazing host definitely add a tennis ball on a string or something üòâ
i was going to ask doesn t it get too hot on your roof but this answers that question that s quite a setup for the cool cats
a live stream would be amazing but even just the videos are great how did you initially find out they were on your roof
the ball and shelter are likely good ideas they don t need to interact with you the shelter could be as simple as pieces of plywood they can hide under and the ball could be good hunting practice for the kittens
it s nice in a way if it s a lineage of the same family that the females remember that your house is somewhere safe to grow up definitely chuck a tennis ball up there though
learn the difference between then and than you re an adult
put up a sturdy ball on a rope for them to play with
i m really stoned and i read this tony starks voice for some raisin
please put one of those sticks with a ball hanging at the end in front of the game cam no harm to put a fake bird toy out
gt they are wild animals and needed to be treated as such and cant get used to humans good man
oh please live stream if you can it would be like kittenacademy on wild mode
i just wanted to commend you for taking an adult and responsible approach to the murder kittens living on your roof for the most part nature needs us humans to stay the hell away so i like your respectful approach of not trying to humanize them but rather appreciate them for the wonderful animals that they are
if you have the time and equipment please stream it
so do you live in like bobcat junction why so many of them around
thank you you don t want to teach them to trust humans as much as you are being a total bro you don t want them to assume that about other humans and end up crossing the wrong path getting too comfy around cars or becoming what others may deem a nuisance
wow these are so cute and i oh my god he said hello to the camera
if you do happen to start a live stream of this family i will be a faithful viewer
reason last owners left eaten by bobcats looking to downgrade to a smaller place to save on property taxes
do you live in florida by any chance something about your roof the trees bobcat family say florida to me
probably contributes to them hating it as well if its usually unoccupied and quiet
nice thing about this is you have free rodent and small pest protection too
i came back from work down south and some birds were already nesting in the box by the back door she was fairly alarmed when i showed up i had to stick my head out like a bird for a few days before she calmed down she was like what are you doing here and i was like i was already living here and besides i would never hurt you
been few years since ive been to arizona but i remember there were a lot of areas hit hard by the collapse near where a friend lived there was an entire housing development with a couple dozen or more suburban style houses and only a few weren t vacant
at mama bobcat translation ‚Äúboy da fuck u doing get back in here ‚Äù
at what point did you realize this was happening what clued you in
where do you live and are you worried about small dogs if you have them thank you for sharing and for respecting them leaving wildlife alone this is an amazing video
thank you for providing a safe place for them while acknowledging they re still wild and not interfering i wish everyone would be as awesome to wild cats as you are
my man next year you should leave some water aswell üëåüèª
at first sight it looked like your house is dug into to the sand
i m tempted to phone a friend to come bring me some bobcat potions i work early but with enough bobcat potion i can push through tomorrow as well
can we please make this a thing reddit i ve been a bobcat for a while now
i was practicing being a bobcat while persuading reddit then i read the post about the person having to peak their head out their back door ‚Äúlike a bird‚Äù to calm a nesting bird down and the banter between mama bird and redditor it‚Äôs not weird it was in english and after reading it four more times and marveling in astonishment at the scene that had been presented before me i realized that i don‚Äôt need to practice being a bobcat i am the bobcat
this needs to be a youtube channel and i would subscribe to it times if i have to
my students and i would love a live stream of this animal cams relax us and bring us joy while we work
yes please stream or provide us with constant updates
is the little guy who climed over the side in the video ok
do you have more with the kitten noises like at it s quiet but there s a little mrrl after the birds fly by
well historically most accounts of battles would seem to indicate that human males ultimately triumph and win against full grown bobcats attacks from bobcats on humans and the related canadian snow leopard species are overall relatively rare but again when they have occurred historically human males mostly of the s settler type often ended up triumphant although admittedly baring a lot of scars and substantial blood loss
our cats will eat us when we‚Äôre dead dr mittens will actually become murder mittens
a tabby could eat you it would just need someone else to kill you first
no no shere khan is a lover not a fighter he s just playing as he begins devouring me
gt the difference between a tabby and a tiger is that one can actually eat you either will eat you the real difference is whether or not you are alive at the time they start doing so
correction one can eat you quickly the other will take a few days
the mom actually leaves for most of the day and provides their hydration through her milk i think
albeit that may be a noble and generous doing that honestly could be a bad idea while trying to provide for this mom and her cubs it may inadvertently attract more wild cats other than this mom and her litter but also a consistently bringing them back in my area especially where the neighborhood is majorly occupied by families with young children these situations cause risk lots of house pets have gone missing and have had close calls with young children but have had some attacks on people and people with their dogs hiking trails not far from their communities while i love these awww moments as much as the next letting these beauties live in the same place with us can be a ticking time bomb never know could walk out or be returning and get ambushed from above or in you backyard i‚Äôm not saying call animal control or and have them removed just don‚Äôt give them more of a reason to stay long term
i don t think people should go out of their way to provide comfort to bobcats in an urban area it would encourage them to stay
no thats not ok the mom wouldnt have picked there if it didnt have water this is a natural habitat as of now dont fuck it up the cats are fine
no the best thing op can do for them is to leave them alone if they weren t able to survive there they wouldn t keep coming back year after year
its not good to encourage any kind of dependence on humans let wild animals be wild
if it seemed like the animals were in danger by being in an urban area the only good decision is to call wildlife authorities who could relocate them to a safe place it is always a bad idea to try to provide for wild animals
no this is not okay if its natural instincts led it to the roof without water that should be left alone if it made a mistake and picked a bad spot nature should be left alone to do its thing
gt i think at least providing a water source nearby more for the mom i think no need to get too close would be ok gt gt gt gt being wild they should at least get their own food without humans but water can be tricky especially in the city where we don t have many ponds due to drainage systems please stop making suggestions like this it is bad for the animals and humans these are wild animals not fury babies with human emotions
this house is not in the middle of the city and it s a small city anyway coyotes use the various washes and can pop up just about anywhere plenty of rabbits to feed on
leave wild animals be you don t need to project your savior complex onto others
i agree op needs to string up some lights get a couple of couches pine cones and make it into a rooftop bar he can call it the watering hole
the lion at the end has completely flattened out their box haha
ops video and now this i just need to quit while i m ahead it s been great
why do black panthers always look like they re about to murder you
is there a reason why to this a friend bought a dollar bed for her cat and the cat basically lived in that cardboard for weeks straight instead
idk am i wrong for being upset seeing animals like that in captivity i understand why for protection it seems in those cases but it still always bothers me to see that idk guess its just one of those days
aw now i m missing my old boy ralph he fucking loved cardboard boxes more than anything in the world he used to climb into them and i d pick up the box and carry him around the house like he was a king he was my best friend throughout my childhood and teen years and unfortunately passed away unexpectedly a few months ago while i was at school rip little buddy
circus sex is like my sex life up in air from moment to moment
where do surfers sleep when they go camping circus sex intense
i fucking knew it felt it but still clicked it god damn it
first time in years where i didn‚Äôt expect it kudos to you you deserve this upvote
i knew exactly what would happen but i clicked anyway
thank you for keeping it alive i know day to day users will respond the way they do but just think of the future glory in roughly a thousand years time when some schulb will be considering it a ‚Äúrisky click‚Äù only to confirm yes they were in fact rick rolled however i can only hope that in time the current rick roll will have evolved from a rick astely roll into a rick sanchez roll performing as rick astely rolll but i guess i might have too much faith in humanity sincerely scuttlebutt
it s been years since my last rick roll it actually feels refreshing
the bartender is epic his dishrag toss n grab is legendary
for fucks sake it s how am i still falling for this
dammit i m done for today with rick in my head does anybody know a good counter song
it‚Äôs just a photo why you waste your time typing this
maybe they photoshopped the nose to be less reflective how dare you sir
you could also use radial filters to accomplish a similar effect
i have a black lab and can only take a picture of her outside or if she s sitting in a sunbeam otherwise she s a void of blackness she also has a black bed and we forget she s sleeping there sometimes and at night it s just kind of come on blackblob let s go for a walk
i m pretty good with detecting slight differences in shading for colors that are adjacent but i m not able to do it when the shades i m comparing are in different areas of an image i don t have photoshop so i don t know if it analyzes whether an image has been altered but i do have a low tech technique w my favorite free editor irfanview i used it to look at the brightness level i surround the image with a large border in this case i made it black then i just sample the color in specific areas and paint a large circle in the border until i ve got a grid of colors and shades to compare from your comment i expected the lightest reflections on the nose to be lighter than those on the floor but they are much darker they are the same color and shade as the slate gray as the floor appears to be overall looking back at your comment i now see that you didn t actually say the nose would have lighter highlights only that the lightness would be the same the floor highlights are a light grey much lighter than the nose i also sampled the white rim around the eye and the bright reflection in the eye to my surprise they are a lighter version of the floor highlights and all three look to be the same color of blue grey in different shades the eye lights look almost sky blue and are closer in shade to the floor than the floor is to the nose i haven t got enough specific knowledge in graphic design to say this indicates an altered image but i noticed that the color is unexpectedly the same that says to me that the reflections on the dog s nose are not from the same source as on the floor but are a reflection of the lighted floor they are the same color but darker so that makes sense if this is a sound analysis then do you still say that the image was photoshopped i don t know but i do thank you for expanding my understanding of what to look for i ve been concerned about deep fake video and whether we ll never be sure if a video is real or faked but if you are right and the shading of highlights same light source can be easily compared visually even when reflected off different surfaces and colors then i m reassured i think you may have used your experienced to eyeball this image and i think it s possible you are incorrect i d like it if you care to weigh in again since i m learning and i m interested either way thanks for teaching me something today
omg six tiny kittens bully the big doggo that just yes this gives me life
i just adopt of month old kitten and my beagle scare the shit out of him any advice to let them play together
when i let our golden retriever interact with our chickens we were scared he‚Äôd be too violent or bite one of them but turns out they just chased him all and he was terrified of them
not surprised kittens are mentally and physically equipped to defend themselves from larger predators they have sharper claws and teeth and the inhibitive part of their brains develop later which means they‚Äôre not scared to take on a larger opponent in rural areas where stray cats aren‚Äôt regularly spayed or neutered kittens are a huge ecological threat because small squads of kittens tend to go after and disrupt animals that cats should leave alone the whole reason you never see bigfoots anymore is because roaming hordes of wild kittens have all but chased them away from their homes into the snowy mountains the bigfoots changed their names to ‚Äúyetis‚Äù to try to hide from the kittens making it harder to google their whereabouts we can only wonder who‚Äôs the next kitten target
awwwwwwwwww this is the cutest thing i ve heard so far today
my akita too gets bullied by kittens she s especially scared of the smol hissy variety of kittens
thanks for the silver i don t even know how to post more pics in this thread
i feel like there should be some video proof of this please
we have four bunnies in our backyard that bully our great dane
i really need video of this adorable kitten bullying
omg i need a video of this stat big ol goof tippy taps are life
i‚Äôve said this before and i‚Äôll say it again some dogs are absolute kitten whores
please give us that video we must witness the cutest bulling of all time
i was with you till rural areas when i came across bigfoot and thought you this must be the guy with real facts and thank goodness i was correct good job mate keep it up
i am irrationally proud of myself when i manage to check the username before i get sucked in
i know i ve been in reddit for too long when i force myself to not look at the username and try to guess mankind jumper cables or this one
how do we know that they chased them into the mountains and didn t just brutally murder them
i expected hell in a cell i m a little disappointed ngl
you had me for two entire paragraphs you magnificent son of a bitch
gt in rural areas where stray cats aren‚Äôt regularly spayed or neutered kittens are a huge ecological threat because small squads of kittens tend to go after and disrupt animals that cats should leave alone til kittens are like zerglings
i needed the laugh this morning thanks for providing it d
gt kittens are a huge ecological threat i m just imagining a small army of waddling kittens with their little needle teeth and razor sharp claws that they haven t quite worked out how to retract yet
i love how your username uses the word with the same way as processed food labels there s always a few real facts in there amongst the load of creative falsehoods
we have a bigfoot festival happening in my town this weekend no wonder i ve seen more kittens prowling around
i swear sometimes i just feel like they‚Äôre a hive mind especially since they‚Äôve about doubled by now
i ve been in a pen with chickens which i recognize isn t a ton but it s chaos not organized chaos like them all chasing me just then running around basically randomly and running into each other
it s at least better than being chased by swans that s something i would never want to go through
i‚Äôm of the belief that there is a certain number of chickens that will actually take down a human maybe it‚Äôs not but maybe it‚Äôs there‚Äôs gotta be a point at which you‚Äôre just worn out and the chickens just keep going at you
have you seen what chickens could do in ocarina of time
as someone who has a flock in their backyard when they decide to follow you around the yard it reminds me of the scene from jurasic park when those little dinos attack the girl
how do you think they eat long bones they hold with their paws
it s not the paw action for me it s the fact he s on his back while he is eating it does make him use his paws more which adds to the weirdness my dog loves lying on his back like this but if any food comes near him he instantly flips upright
sometimes my cat will use her paw to scoop water out and then lick her paw no idea why
they ll often hold a bone or toy with their paws while gnawing it the weird thing here is this one lying on its back it makes the paw work stand out more
my boston tries to use her paws like hands constantly sometimes it works other times she looks at me sad because she really thought she had it that time
that s pretty smart you wouldn t want that pineapple to fall and get covered in sand
dogs will be the ones to over rule us and take over the world you all just think it is cute
ive never seen a dog take bites and chew usually they just inhale whatever i give them
my pit boxer loves to hold treats in her paws while eating
i never saw a dog eat pineapple before so this is a double win
keeping it out of the sand is a motivator apparently
that dog is holding that pineapple away from a sandy doom too amazing
we had a kitten that my roommate saved from a puddle she was very very young so only had us humans to learn from she also are with her paws sitting on her hind feet on a chair at the table with her own plate she was cool named her ratface sounded better than puddles
usually dogs don‚Äôt gotta worry about their pineapples getting sandy
we gave ours a marrow bone she not only held it but used the other paw to scoop out the marrow
it s refreshing to see a dog actually enjoy something instead of trying to swallow it without chewing
it did for me too and i haven‚Äôt even seen that movie
and op will be reminded of it everyday i own two siamese and they don t give a fuck
fuck i literally came here to comment we are siamese if you please we are siamese if you don t please so at least i m in good company
i remember this scene always creeping me out as a kid the song was weird and eery the house is dark the cats are strange and in sync and their bad behavior all made me uncomfortable it was probably intended but as a kid it‚Äôs more intense
i must have listened to this record a hundred times as a kid god i‚Äôm old
i came here to say i new this would be top comment but i did not see what was expected the lyrics alone
same amp x b every single time amp x b ahhh s brainwashing p
an eyepatch will fix that sad kitty look and make it kitty pirate look
these bastards have realised that the sadder they look the easier it is to get food
kitty sees more with that one eye than most people will ever see in their entire life
that s the terrified kitty look that pupil is hella dilated and its ears are flattened to the sides
now we just have to cross the t s and dot the lower case j s
for real new viewers will have the wrong perception
if you re trying to pick up punning i ve been looking for a pupil
if you upvote this comment ill be your basketball buddy just like in this video
has classic second smallest kid on the court syndrome
that was lovely someone give that kid something nice what a guy
"the most upvotes post on reddit is days old
im so proud of this community"
love this the happiness has just created what a guy
i had no idea they were so adorable until today thanks fox guy

hippity hoppity this sun is my property all the animals
aw mann if dumpert gets reposted here what will i do with my remaining hours per day s
i thought my cat and daughter would be lifelong best friends with how he cuddled my pregnant belly he hated her guts for years and to this day merely tolerates her presence
this gives me hope for my jerk cat and my future children
happened with los paternal grandparents cat vicious bastard bit me once üôÑloves my kid hes now one of the most affectionate cats i ve ever met sooooo weird
this is so cute but really i‚Äôm just trying to figure out which shirt he‚Äôs wearing it‚Äôs a target harry potter one right
my old cat who lived until he was loved children our garden backed onto a primary school and every break lunch time he would go to visit if ever i saw a group of children crowded together you could depend on him to be right in the middle getting pets
cat is has stolen the son‚Äôs affection to disappoint all the dogs
i bet before this happened you were tempted to show kitty the door please introduce us to ornery kitty and your son
‚Äúwe can do this all night if you want to‚Äù thanks t i am fulfilled
this is one of the best thibgs ever and i will be blasting it for my pups birthday
lol little doggo had a bigger celebration than my bar mitzvah great vid man
my husband and i just watched you on hot ones today was one of the better episodes although we watched the rachel ray one right after and she was just eating those sauces by the spoonful üòÖ
hey t pain this is awesome it‚Äôs been almost two weeks since you posted it but i just saw it now from a linked post and i freakin love it love your energy enthusiasm and good nature in everything i‚Äôve seen from you i wish there were more celebrities like you out there keep crushing it
sitting on the couch watching this and my husband from across the room says ‚Äúwhat‚Äôre you listening to it sounds so catchy ‚Äù ü§£
you know a the great thing about dogs is even though all people say they have the goodest boy they re all correct
lol my gf martinis in just kissed my phone good job op
he s got to be extra sure he doesn t accidentally get you in between those teeth right
if it was slow motion his blink would be faster than the speed of sound
am i the only one who finds the position of the knife and fork irritating
that s a retriever retrievers were bred to have a very soft bite so as not to damage the quarry this one has level
we taught our dog if when we gave him food if he took it too aggressively and accidentally or almost bit us we d take it back and make him try again and he understood that meant oh i need to be gentler my bad we could do this several times in a row and he would end up doing this just trying his absolute hardest to be as gentle as physically possible he was such a sweetie
looks like those videos of people in backhoe loaders honsetly the name is as weird sounding in english as in french or bulldozers doing minute tasks like opening bottles of beers are you sure your dog isn t controlled by a miniature and slightly drunk construction worker
i also love that there is a champagne bottle on the table i dont know what you are doing but it looks like you are doing it right
he also tells good jokes how do you call a three humped camel
we got a moir√© pattern in the background as well double glitch
why do i want to open the sink wtf is wrong with me
my cat was too heavy so once he jumped over the sink and broke it water was everywhere my dad was yelling at me when fixing it miss those days when you got a cat to play with ps he even broke my electric fan my wooden floor he accidently opened the water controler when he was locked in my bathroom water was everywhere again and it was not until minutes later when i saw water dropping on my head did i notice about this he sometimes scratched me and the scars still remains until these days although he caused so many damages i still love him always
i thought this was a photo of my cat wow what a cutie
i have a feeling just turning the knob would unclog your sink in a heartbeat
as you can see my favourite pet i did lack some attention recently
oh no sink clogging kitty oh no lol beautiful pfloof üòÑüòÉüíìüëç
we have a cat that looks almost exactly like him and he‚Äôs such a little shit we have another one who is chill as hell but this one just loves to annoy us so much does your cat do the same meaning it‚Äôs a breed thing or do i just have an asshole cat
that cat was like ‚Äûgirl who you lookin at looks up looks down hm okay nice shirt karen here a human kiss now be happy peasant
when he licked your nose i visibly aww d very cool video op
you are the chosen one since you got the cat approve to hand out so close
jc get over yourself i hate these kinds of videos where you‚Äôre actually just trying to look cute and you‚Äôre pretending it‚Äôs about the animal
you should learn about drunk eyes cants love it you relax your face like you re about to pass out and it shows that cat that you feel safe enough to be vulnerable the bonding will be fantastic
katsu sounds pretty close to the german word for cat katze
that beatific smile when the kitty kissed her nose tho üòä
wow she is a stunning natural beauty tortoiseshell cats are so chill not surprised katsu is so sweet
this is just further proof that i haven t even the slightest clue how old someone could be just looking at them i d guess you were like and i d guess my mom s neighbor s daughter had i not been there for the birth babysitted her tutored her etc was when she s really
thats me monday morning when my alarm says go to work i go up turn it off and snooz another minutes
nah that s just me after falling asleep on a sweaty day and being trampled by a bunch of wooly sheep
he manages it and is like shall i stand nahh time for another nap
the sad thing about this is that in the future this might be the only way we see polar bears in captivity
i m going to get into trouble but here s another negative since there is a lack of food for the wild polar bears they have been finding nutrition the only way that they can by eating their young don t get angry with me do something about it
sure this isn t just a drunk guy in a polar bear costume
lol i looked at this and thought ‚Äúmom is that you ‚Äù
that reminds me of my dad and me when i was afraid to get in the water and he pushed me
thanks for moving the box so the kitty dont fall between box and box lol
she s looking at her kitten the same way my cat s look at glasses of water set on my dresser i knew this wasn t going to end well
no bats are bad and carry nipah ebola rabies and other deadly diseases birds are the good ones
i would have all the bats if they did not have the rabies
not so cute when you learn about the fact that bats are flying incubator tanks for over of the nastiest viruses mankind is facing from rabies nipah hendra over ebola and marburg to sars and that s just the tip of the ice berg so no matter how cute an injured wild bat looks like don t pick it up especially not with bare hands
fruit bats deserve more attention i ll continue to ignore the other ones
you shouldn t touch wild bats though as they can spread rabies
bats are incredible the only mammal that can truly fly they always make me look at them like they are pups that grew wings fruit bats that is
i know this is a huge surprise but this is a repost
i finally figured out what my dog looks like he s a black pom i adopted
you are so right bats do deserve more attention givebatsmoreattention
i gave you a five but it took me back to the start of my recommendations
guy top left looks like he relieving his stress with a lot of weed
the guy above the dog looks like jack nicholson in the shinning with a lower budget
the same dog was also named last year in someone else‚Äôs school what a coincidence
why does everyone in this photo besides the dog look really uncomfortable
the service dog at my high school named avalanche was also given his own picture in the year book i could‚Äôve posted this too
i‚Äôm glad the general look of teachers has not changed since i left school
wow mike bordin is a staff member too faith no more gotta go tour again
i do yearbook photos last fall i had a blind teacher for blind kids insist on his photo with his guide dog it was cute he s been at his school long enough that everyone knows him and his dog so he thought it most appropriate to get his photo with his dog
what is a school‚Äôs service dog does it comfort students that do poorly on exams
the guy top centre is rocking that jack nicholson look
at the risk of sounding dumb what the hell is a service dog
i thought the lady on the left was hilary clinton at first
i m sorry op if this is your favourite teacher but lefty looks like someone i would rather not have
lady to the left is thinking im gonna kill one of these little shits
i was not expecting that at all the cuteness hit me like a ton of very fluffy bricks
that is the most precious thing i have ever seen just wow
i‚Äôve had of cats who look just like these sweeties love and miss them all
these kitties are from ths instagram page go home loa
i‚Äôve never taken my dogs to a hotel but i like to imagine that the staff would pet them too
i work at a hotel and this dog is hired as our new guest relations manager amp x b you start right now so i can rub your belly
oh when i was a kid i went to germany with my family we stopped in a hotel which had one quite thicc cat
this is my dog if i get anywhere close to him he will just tumble over
my doggo does that then i put my hands on his neck and make choking noises then when he realizes he just stsrts pretending dead
i love how there doesn t even seem to be a spot that s doing it the entire belly is just one big spot
i mean he s a dirty boot licker but god i wouldn t want him any other way
my dog died the same thing my dad calls her defective which couldn t be more true considering she s dumb as a bag of bricks we love her though
i would like this to be a box that you can check when searching for hotels like hotel must have a dog that harrsses guests with insatiable need for belly rubs
you can check out any time you like but you can never leave
the way he rolls on their side the second they reach the foot
a family friend had a bull terrier that would bite you and press down harder and harder unless you started petting him he ended up being separated a lot
i want more hotels with dogs that come up to you and roll over for belly rubs
i really need a dog like this makes me feel needed haha
this is cuteness overload for me if i was at that place i would hardly ever talk to my friends i‚Äôd just want to scratch his belly all night
hold up hold up hold up home up belly rubs plz hold up hold up hold up hold up hold up belly runs plz
i‚Äôm literally crying from laughing this is the best thing i‚Äôve ever seen
why is she putting an electric dildo in that poor cat s face
i haven t laughed this hard in a few days that little quick one at thank you for this
i love the pattern of snoring long squeaky snoring followed by pfft
sounds like he s on stage and told a bad joke and is trying to get the audience to laugh ehh d
normally not one to share but i have been having the worst day and you have made me laugh to the point of tears and raised my spirits immensely thank you op sincerely
this made snort when i laughed haha like you i enjoy the little things in life
lmao that one drum like sound made me think the beat was about to drop
like the mating calls of a whale or something it sounds like
i didn t want to laugh at this but i couldn t help it amp x b what is that he s snoring into
the breathing difficulties of my expensive smush faced cat are so funny
the woman behind the cameras laughing snorting is what made me laugh
stuff like this is why i like reddit thanks for posting
so that s the creature that makes those sounds in stardew valley
is it just me or do we all want to see the person who recorded this show me who you are my lady
not funny nor cute snort snout cats like shoet snout dogs suffer from breathing issues the price they pay for human vainity and silliness
i don t understand what is so extremely funny about animals with obvious health issues breeding these types of animals is selfish and supporting it should be avoided although they are cute and adorable i don t find this even a bit funny
my boyfriend sent me this and said this is what i sound like üò≠üòÇ
we need to make this into a ring tone does anyone know how to extract sound and convert to audio file
which one can do anything and which one has the bad script
be careful that hawks or eagles don t swipe them when they are outside

yes learn to swim so you may know how to drown the humans
i wanna know why i heard the statement no petting wait what
it‚Äôs against the rules to link their instagram but their handle is duck n quack official
they can drown if they cant get out they become tired and will drown
good to see this post of their pond from personal expirence i can tell you they will need more space i don t know if you have it but you will want a rather large undergravel filter that s serviceable about once a week to filter out the bio waste ducks are supposed to spend the majority of their time in water they will get bumblefoot otherwise
that s so cute üòçthe first video i saw was also just perfect
unpopular opinion but these are bad names imo look i can do it to quack black smh
i still don t know which is quakie chan and which is duck norris
im disappointed with the llack of portal memes here
this cat is brought to you by aperture science we do what we must because we can
came to the thread to see how many rengar references was not disapointed
do people not get tired of seeing this shit every day y all realize most are photoshopped right
such beautiful eyes if it were my cat i would totally give it a name from portal something like chell or glados if it s a female and maybe cave or wheatley if it s a male you could also just name it arperture although turret would also be a much cuter name
one eye sees the matrix one eye sees reality but his snoot books the truth
magnificent and gorgeous i love this cat and would be delighted to be around this cat
yes i am ready to hunt dragons on my griffin sir crystal
this photo was taken moments before the cat pounced on its owner
where are people getting all these mystical looking pets i want one
awww look how absolutely happy and safe and loved you have made him feel what a beautiful thing you are such good cat parents
the soul link is complete successfully acquired el gato
it s so nice seeing humans finally feeling safe and being free to act like they want to in their forever homes lt
i m pretty sure no man sleeps like that in a shelter its good you picked him up
may be should get a new boyfriend husband then can let them take all the room
congrats on adopting a hobo good luck getting him off the couch
i still don‚Äôt understand how a cats paw bends like that
when a cat has its belly up it means it trusts you you re its trustworthy human
if a cat or dog sleeps like that they feel happy and safe
my dude you look almost exactly like my little brother i m actually scared
that s why you don t pick up a grown up human from the shelter at least your cat watches over him
best photo i have seen so far your cat can now relax and he knows he s safe and home a beautiful photo üíñüê±
fun fact cats sleep on their backs only when they feel safe
animals expose their belly when they feel safe and at comfort if not they will protect their weakest part of the body
is he maine coon he looks like my kitty who is year old and lbs
i wish you could have heard the sound i made when the blanket was pulled back
omg i have the same blanket i know how warm that kitty feels d
it has two little itty bitty horns above the eyes üòÇüíï
i wish to be able to sleep at this level of peace ‚ò∫Ô∏è
fuck diamonds this is the most precious thing in the world
i always wanted a pet but my asian parents say get the a then you can have a pet
it s me missi and i m the cutest thing you ll see all day awwwww muaahhh
this little one needs to be loved and protected sweet perfect baby creature
i think my body just slightly imploded with how cute that was
david attenborough the kitten raises its tiny paws in supplication this will be her way out of danger though they can easily be overpowered kittens have a powerful defense mechanism at their disposal the ability to stun their natural predators with cuteness it looks as though her gamble has paid off
i‚Äôm here lying in bed thinking about putting my phone down and going to sleep and now that‚Äôs what i‚Äôm going to do this is such a sweet moment to end the day with
waiting for the activation key a warm kiss to animate
officer officer my hands are up and my eyes are closed and i m in a blanket i m not guilty and until you decide that i m going to nap
put your hands up you re under arrest for being too cute
omg it s too cute i need this beauty in my life right now x
peek aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa peekaboo exe is not responding force close or wait for fluffball to respond
why is there an iron on the subwoofer is this what the kids are calling and heavy metal
damnit he is going to completely bungle the nd quarters projections and he didn t even consult me on factoring in the sudden amortization due to the merger i swear jim if you shut me out like this again i am just going to switch to our competitors
my female cat is like this except it is when we close the door to use the bathroom
someone closed a door what kind of a household are you running
my cat taught herself how to open doors with that type of handle at first it took her a few tries but now she opens it on the first attempt every time
it pleases me that her name is waffles please pet her for me
waffles is an excellent name for a cat i may steal that
pretty sure this is just an english staffy judging by the fatter head cute af though
i was really hoping this would be a gif and the boop would be included
i am already wondering what he did and obviously got away with
been totally terrified of dogs for of my years then last august my neighbour‚Äôs got a british bulldog puppy rosie and because of a shift mix up i ended up babysitting her for hours she‚Äôs now months and i absolutely adore her she‚Äôs so darn friendly that on our walks i‚Äôve had to interact with some many other dog walkers that i‚Äôve overcome my fear long story short sorry i looked at this beautiful face and felt love i want to pet and kiss and cuddle so much dogs are awesome
those things are ugly and always will be not even near what we consider cute
when you join the aww subreddit you truly will aww every time you look through reddit such a cute face
what the heck is with the vicious stream of downvotes here on harmless comments like so cute what s wrong with people that they have so much hate they have to spread it on a sweet picture of a dog and discourage anyone who says something nice please scroll down and upvote the nice comments there s absolutely no reason they should be negative points like they are the stigma against pitts is unnecessary and unfair stop punishing people with actual sense
oh my god that beautiful face reminds me my bear needs some goodnight kisses
i‚Äôm invisible if i dont move i‚Äôm invisible im invisi damn she won‚Äôt stop
cat seems distrusting of you i think don t they usually squint their eyes to show they aren t threatened by you
i m just imagining the cat trying to say help me i can t move she has me under a spell release me from my pain
my cat does the same exact thing its a maine coon thing they love rolling around and they are the most chill cats ever
i ve seen a lot of photos and gifs of cats on their back recently has there been a firmware update or something
my tummy is vulnerable but please note my tooth is visible
me when my huband gives me attention he was put on a wierd shift so we don t get to spend much time together at the moment
his eyes are like when my eyes are unaffected by the air for a brief moment in time
that is the cutest chonk i ever saw i could watch this all day üòç
it‚Äôd be criminal to name him anything other than nugget
i‚Äôm not an expert on dogs but this little guy looks a little bit too fat isn‚Äôt he
too cute a bit overfed tho he s so fat he will burst
ty i thought so but i was confussed since he soo fluffy
i keep waiting for him to roll off that couch but there is no couch the anxiety make it stop
i wish my dog still did this i loved playing with him as a puppy and doing this and he seemed to love it as well now though he just stops moving and stares at me then jumps up and walks away
if you don t put your dog in bat wings next halloween i will be disappointed
please tell me his name is ace because he looks like ace the bathound
your dog looks like my beloved stuff dog from mexico
i have a chihuahua rat terrier mix that looks almost identical to your guy such a cutie
he really does i love fruit bats my favorite is ruby on youtube
your dog is adorable whispering i don t think he knows what a bruit bat looks like
subspecies of fruit bat diurnal flightless fruit sucker
your fruit bat kinda looks looks like a good boi there mate
holy crap he looks just like our italian greyhound chihuahua mix i had to double take
well the largest bat ever it s a fruit bat and also called fox i am not sure but i guess it s called that cuz it is related to foxes and those are canine
you ll have to make him some little wings for halloween lol
i asked my girlfriend of years to pass me the remote and she slapped me then went on about feminism
i ve noticed the immediate reaction of pretty much any girl being proposed to is to raise their hands to their mouth it s a recurring pattern
congratulations to the both of you i wish the best for you two
i didn t know it was legal to marry a girlfriend of years but anyways have an awesome year ahead and congratulations
okay this is beautiful in many ways etc but who the fuck uses the term my girlfriend of years
i want to make a joke about your girlfriend being tall for only being years old but i just can t this is just too beautiful huge congratulations
are we just going to ignore the kitten on the table
i didn‚Äôt even see the dog all i saw was the monkey on the table stealing food what is that actually though
congrats came here hoping for a face swap but this is cute too
sir your dog is middle left in this photo just saying congratulations
is there a fluffy item on the table or am i going crazy
you look exactly like one of my coworkers like exactly so weird
without knowing your girlfriend advice from my own experience marry the dog less troubles
capturing the moment you proposed imagine showing your kids in the years to come just fantastic
you two wear your shoes in the house also congratulations
that s so sweet congratulations to both of you and a tight huggie to your doggy
bitch is thiccc oh and your girlfriend pretty hot too
all these shoe comments yeesh anyways congratulations
that is a very unique interpretation of the word bottom closer to dead center left p
is is that a kitten on the table or am i hallucinating
bottom left it‚Äôs a stool i mean yah it has legs but that‚Äôs definitely not a dog
i wish we had another photo with a different viewpoint where we could ve also seen your facial expression very happy for you both i mean three of you congratulations
i thought that wierd hairy version of watto on the table was your dog
the dog s like i m not totally sure what s going on but i m happy to be here
wow she‚Äôs tall for a five year old also that‚Äôs disgusting
dog thinks he has a treat in his hand lets be honest
lmao i love how the anwser to this is your name hahahah
congratulations i m so happy for you two she looks like the happiest girl alive you ve both found the one the person you are going to be forever happy with and the dog found its dad aw just so genuinely excited for another family to be
congratulations damn i think i got something in my eye
congratulations if you can find someone who is willing to keep the table as messy as you do you guys will do well
really too emotional hope your all wishes fulfill in your life
you made her cry but she doesn t seem to be sad the dog doesn t know whether or not it should bite you
okay sorry i dont understand west culture very much what is the different between living with your girlfriend and living with your wife ü§î
for all those years i have tought that wearing outdoor footwear inside is something that belongs only to hollywood movies nice scene tho
i like how your proposed to her privately at home i ve always thought those to be extra special and personal compared to public proposals
congratulations my dude hope everything goes as planned for the special day
alright i m gonna be the downvote farming asshole and say t h i c c ps good luck for your endeavours as a couple man cheers
i‚Äôd have to say the dog is more middle left either way congrats bro
well you better have gotten your dog a ring as well
i assume you re whoring for karma because the alternate option is that you re severely autistic to the point where i m surprised you could grasp the concept of getting on one knee to propose or even get what emotion is crop the dog out an emotional reaction from a woman getting proposed to crop the people out a dog it could be looking at a dog biscuit a pile of shit dead birds or just fucking nothing it just looks like a dog with its mouth open
congrats i was just about to give up on love and kill myself but you changed everything fuck yeah
wow she was thinking maybe you will never ask but she still would stay with you anyway ‚ù§
this is awesome your dog is awesome congratulations mate üò¨üëçüèª
congratulations doggo middle left is deffo happy your other dog bottom left has a rather wooden expression
you can tell they are american because they have their shoes on in their house
that dog isn t even reacting it s just panting normally what the fuck is this
i was looking at the furry hood thinking it was a weird as fuck dog for too long
weird amount of here mfs telling you how to dress in your own home do whatever the hell you want
that bitch be smilin amp x b amp x b girlfriend seems happy as well
so we know who feeds the good doggo extra scooby snacks
years i‚Äôve been with my girl for years since high school am i late to asking her wth
she must really love you if she said yes to that awkward shaved beard jokes aside congrats mate
i enjoy pics like this because my husband and i are high school sweethearts from the ‚Äôs and we just eventually got married there was never a proposal year anniversary this memorial day weekend
congratulations i could imagine a more memorable way to propose marriage but you know her and what she likes good luck
congratulations on your puppy s mommy becoming official and to the both of you congratulations
bottom right there is another dog probably jumping in happiness you captured the tail
i why why do people wear shoes indoors congrats op but still shoes inside
you monster wearing shoes inside the house congrats though
thanks for specifying which one was the dog or i would have been confused
hmm as non native speaker i thougth first your girlfriend is years old
goddamn i know this girl from college awesome person ggwp m
my boy is out here double cheecked up on a thursday afternoon cap is getting a run for his money
"dog stands with mouth open
redtards look at dat emotions"
you guys are gonna have a heck of a good life together i‚Äôm no one to you but i am very happy for you two
that‚Äôs a dead ass proposal northerner timberlands joke
well good luck usually things go down after the wedding
that‚Äôs a yawn never mind at least the dog looks happy
congratulations the dog looks like he knows what s going on and is just smiling from ear tout ear because he s excited
i love the phones on the table i imagine prior to the proposal he kept his and made her keep her phone away so nothing would interrupt their special moment beautiful congratulations
love this congratulations i hope you have the dog as part of the wedding party
your dog is getting second human so you know who is happier
definitely the dog congratulations op god bless your wedding
i guess you could say it was kodak moment ripley wow face
sort by controversial and get the best comments judging her and the dog s impefect figure as well as the ensuing rage
holy shit apparently everyone gives a shit about whether or not people wear shoes inside even if for a fleeting moment grats dude
damnit how can you have a title like that without saying if she said yes p grats mate
your dog on the bottom left looks like a chair my friend
i will never understand why people have the urge to take a picture of themselves proposing and then post it on social media maybe i am greedy but i am going to keep that moment just for me and my girl
you look very much like tom hardy from that angle also congratulations to both of you and the emotional dog
congratulations for both of you genuinely emotions for both of them your girlfriend and happy dog
oh my god this is precious wish you three a lifetime of happiness
cool i lost my wife years ago just thinking about how i first proposed to her i guess my dogs where there too
better than how i did it i proposed in the books a million parking lot congrats though
definitely your girl keep that in mind for the years to come it s always your girl first üòÑ
i love both your girlfriends and your dog s reactions
i‚Äôm on my phone and it looks like your gf‚Äôs hair is standing up but it‚Äôs just the plant in the back lol it adds to her emotions in the picture very cute congratulations
did she say yes if so congratulations on your engagement
its so romanctic when there is a rd person whos already filming
what s so different about being married wheb you re years in a relationship
the dog is on the left not the bottom left this invalidates your proposal
good on you op that looks like the most perfect reaction that reaction tells me you are such a good guy i wish you a lifetime of happiness
dude do you have a gf and a dog you‚Äôre living the life for sure
aawww yrs seems to be the right time to ask for engagement
you should never assume your idea of clean matches supercedes the host s unless of course you know them well even if the host has shoes on maybe they re wearing indoor shoes the considerate thing to do is to err on the side of caution and always ask if it s ok for you to keep your shoes on and only ask if the host is wearing shoes if the host is wearing socks thats an automatic cue to take your shoes off if they are ok with you keeping your shoes on in my experience they will tell you as soon as they see you taking them off to keep them on i would be appalled if someone walked into my house with their shoes on as that would force me to wash all floors and carpets once they leave shoes worn outside have touched the same ground that other people or dogs stepped on and they have stepped in public washrooms pee poo etc
i was going to say the cat was more surprised than anyone just realize that s the fur edge of her coat hood it s to early for this
ahh the ugly cry of joy it‚Äôs a hard move to make happen but you did it you did it
when you said bottom left i thought you meant bottom left corner of the image not to the left of your gf s bottom
congratulations not sure where you think bottom left is though
i was trying to think of a word to describe your dogs reaction i‚Äôve settled on ‚Äúdazzled‚Äù
so sweet your now wify reaction is congratulations to both of you
left the dog is just left not bottom left oh and congrats
gods either yawning or sneezing mistyped still the same thing
the dog is just panting it s not reacting to anything
why wear boots inside if you want to wear something you have slippers
congrates she now owns half your stuff and your dog
alright but real talk you asked her to marry you just so you could spend more time petting her dog didn‚Äôt you
i think it s so touching seriously the dog bumped it
i m glad you specified which one was the dog otherwise jk congrats
dog but now the toilet seat will always be down how will i survive
i cried while proposing to my wife didn t expect that
the little person with the arms up in the right corner is also pretty happy
the dog‚Äôs face just kills me ‚Äúhooman you have done da ting ‚Äù
üòäcongratulations to you both i wish you a happy and healthy life together üòä
amp x b congratulations the hard part begins now amp x b married years ago kids
i asked my girlfriend of five years to marry me earlier this year and we just got married last week enjoy it it‚Äôs only as stressful as you make it we had a blast
it seems like just a dog realize what problems you have now looking it he asks why man why
congratulations i‚Äôm pretty sure my dog wouldn‚Äôt allow me to do this without being on my shoulder
i have a genuine question to the girls are you really that surprised after the guy proposes to you after dating for years like is it really that shocking
congratz but why in the hell are yall wearing shoes inside
‚Äúwell she has great birthing hips ‚Äù dwight all jokes aside i love this photo the dog is ecstatic
lol at all the people bitching about shoes do you think that maybe they just got home or are going out do you guys usually wear jeans around the house if you re settled down
did you just get finished polishing up the ring with glass cleaner p congrats to you both her reaction and your smile make me so happy doggo s enthusiasm earns a few points as well
ok maybe my mind is bad or my english but i really read my girlfriend of years wasn t sure it was legal to marry someone at years old nevertheless congratulations
congrats but stop wearing boots in your house you re giving me anxiety lol
congratulations her reaction is so pure god you guys are cute
awww dude i love this picture so much wish you guys the very best d
thank you so much everyone we‚Äôre dying at all these commentsüòÇüòÇ
username checks out definitely the dog congratulations to the three of you
what the actual fuck is that thing on the table lol
congrats my dumb ass thought your dog was a pile of fur on the table it‚Äôs so easy to see the dog now on the left smh
statistically chances are very little to fond such a good match sadly
what i think is the best with proposal pictures is when the proposee looks at the proposer and not the ring like when i proposed to my lady she just looked me straight in the eyes and was so happy
i‚Äôm glad you told us via ‚Äù bottom left ‚Äù who your girlfriend is and who your dog is
your dog s been waiting for this moment for years üòâ congratulations
dog is fine just breathing anyway i like the picture
aww it s so excited thinking of the incoming babies he ll be able to eat
congrats and love the dog what i have to share human
the ring maybe because she s gonna stuck on her finger and doesn t have a freedom anymore
just his sister here humble bragging for being a part of this moment also yes that dog is known for his facial expressions
asking someone to marry you in your kitchen while wearing boots classy af
wow buddy you are so bitter hows your two month old relationship probably not going to end happily like this cute post
puppies never know what s going on but always ready to celebrate
honey why are you setting up that camera what s in that box why you getting on your knee
dog he s giving you a treat eat it eat it why didn t you eat it don t you like it i ll eat it
can you be married without engagement if so why do people get engaged
shoes on in the house marriage isn‚Äôt lasting sorry man
i‚Äôd be emotional too if you waited years to pop the question and you did it in the damn kitchen
congratulations to all three of you and thank you for sharing
congrats i don t think you know what bottom left means
second favorite hooman can stay over now dog happiness noise
awwwww i once house sat a year old gentleman who looked just like yours such a sweet little fellow i wished i could steal him
just wanted to say thank you all so much for the likes and comments mickey is my best friend and has been for the six years we‚Äôve had him adopted him when he was years old and i love him more than anything in the universe teared up a little seeing all the positivity and love for him since he deserves every bit of it i‚Äôll read him every comment when he wakes up in the morning ‚ù§Ô∏è also a reminder pet your animals and tell them they‚Äôre very good
i completely understand you i would have wanted to share this too he s adorable
he looks alot like my beagle dachshund who just turned üòä
good doggo wearing raincoat cause nobody likes a wet doggo
looks like you know how to take good care of your pup what is his name give him a good snuggle from this human who still misses her cat maggie
how come we can understand dog s facial expressions
haha i ve learned that when using food as a hold tool with my brothers golden i have a short and finite amount of time to take the picture before we have to reset due to the drool puddle
what an adorable guy you did a great job on capturing those eyes
oh my god my dogs name is mougli hes a golden doodle but has black and straight hair
that you motherfucker face when he realized he has been tricked
puperino pretending to be an insta model at day of coachella
why do people on this website talk like they have brain damage when it comes to animals
i feel this would be a great reference pic for a caricature or painting what an innocent beauty
is it dressed up for midsummer s eve looks like it on the grey sky
i ve never seen so much adorableness in one reddit scroll today is a great day for this sub
had a hard time upvoting because every pup is the most adorable pup i‚Äôve ever seen lol
well congratulations on making me think of limecat for the first time in years
chirp chirp chirp puts helmet on nien uffen stifend haba gluten
the squirrels by my moms house will eat right out of our hands
me and my army of avocado armored squirrels shall never be stopped onward to the white house
if you want to see more of this awesome little dude he s on instagram seymour the squirrel
that moment when someone s pet can afford and avocado and you can t
that s either a really tiny avocado or a positively massive squirrel
pretty much the visual representation of how much i love avocados
i read that avocado is toxic to a lot of animals including rodents i hope the squirrel wasn‚Äôt hurt by it
in australia that is like giving a first home deposit to a possum
sarge what is this private private an avocado sir sarge wrong this is government property all nuts revoked
that squirrel loves avocado nearly as much as millennials do
this is why millennials can t get into the housing market
if there s a steady supply of food for it i ll wear anything
col nibbles if you ever try and take this avocado out of my paws i m gonna rip the eyes out of your head piss into your dead skull and use it as my new home when i sleep the rest of the day you f cked with the wrong marine
seymour strikes again haha this squirrel is getting more famous than wally at this point
üëÄ arming the squirrels for the coming bird vs squirrel war over the feeder territory
damn i wish he would ve cut the avocado hat a lot shorter just to make it a jewish squirrel
man i was really hoping for a baby groot wear it as a hat moment
he is now the vulcan squirrel live long n prosper little one
avocado helmet is now my new band name or pornstar name whichever
just curious but who keeps these rabies vectors as pets
my boss rescued a squirrel and even though she released it he still returns every night for dinner
i really appreciate how long this went on after the helmet was put on his head
when you have to hit those macros without getting distracted
dude if you wear this avocado skin on your head for a minute i‚Äôll totally give you a piece of avocado c‚Äômon man it‚Äôs for karma
my first thought was zakk wylde i don t know why or if it s even justified to me the avocado hat looked like a bandana yes thank you
reminds me of the gophers with the combat helmets from donkey kong country üòÇ
gotta toss food near them eventually theyll start coming closer now when they are hungry they ll walk right up to my mom and us and take it right out of our hands and they recgonize us too when we walk past the barely even move other ppl walk past and they go up the trees
cat brain if i m friends with the big milk carton i gets milk all da time
hmm maybe farming cats could be a good addition to farming dogs
the cow and the cat need not be friends yet the milk is a common
first you get the milk then you get the power then you get the women
i kiss your snoot make it clean slep slep slep now is clean
being a cat s friend has two very simple criteria are you too large to eat are you frequently stationary and warm
funny how all the comments about cuteness and then you all turn around and eat dairy
some farm cats to to the calves to get likced clean especially if they have any milk spilt on them
my nem is cat and dis my fren my love for him it knows no end is ver ver big my size is half but i don care i cuddle calf
it‚Äôs so nice to see healthy happy cows and cats for that matter vegan here
little known fact but cattle are in fact several cats heaped together it really makes sense
mine is about to turn and he‚Äôs still full of energy one day he‚Äôll start napping more and it will make me sad your boy is very beautiful ‚ù§Ô∏è
spitting image of my first dog never forgotten lottie ‚ù§Ô∏è
as a guy that s grown up and lived life with many pets i always like to imagine that when they get to this age they have many moments where just look back at fond memories not in a sad way though like when a cat is sunbathing or when a dog rests its head they re just remembering how much fun they had and whi they loved
those beautiful eyes have seen much and seem so full of wisdom
one of my dads brother had a dog that looked almost just like that her name was texas she was sadly put down because she was in pain all the time and the vet didn t find anything
switch your dog to a diet of eggs broccoli fish etc basically nutritious human foods and you might get another in the oldest cat in the world i think was and the second oldest made it to i believe and they were not related in any way except for the same owner that fed them the way i just mentioned plus it helps your pet be happier overall since they won t be getting all that inflammation from crappy carbs that are in most dog food
vute aww cuff fur cuttt cerybcufeelet me pet tbe dogggyyvvvb oh good mymmokmy saw me eating bread
just look at the way he looks at you he loves you lt
reminds me of my dog that passed away years ago when he became old he didn t have much energy left but he was still a very lovable pup i miss him hope you ll keep your dog for a while still and that he ll stay healthy
try hemp and hips for seniors dog treats has hemp oil in it and other things to help with joints etc but the hemp oil doesn t get them high but he ll have energy like new my year old became puppy like again after taking them slightly wears off but still helps
my yr old died he was my best friend i can t describe my screams as i saw he died i was home alone and i am what could ve i have done a few days before he died we found out he had epilepsy he died on my parents bed enjoy your dog as you have him and remember to help him with anything and let him do anything as he is old and he has his needs please love your dog
give that pupper lots of pets from me miss my old pup
my girl turns in two weeks i am so happy to have her around but her face is showing me that our time is growing short
what a sweetie you have give him all the love from me please
that s good now she will be still while you give her all the hugs and kisses she gave you before
black labs have settings puppy and old doggo both are super cute
my black lab is her white beard is nice and full and her ears are turning white she gets little bursts of energy sometimes especially when she sees a crow and she ll do about seconds of zoomies then it s snoozetown for the rest of the day i miss her puppy energy sometimes but i wouldn t trade her in for anything now i love my old girl so much your old pup is so gorgeous give a lil boop for me
looks like my old dog molly she passed away at a couple years ago from cancer i miss her everyday
cbd treats has really helped my old man pup get some pep in his step
i think every dog is part of alldog and they all meld into the huge fellowship of dog spirit when they die that infuses every new puppy and continues the spirit of dog in the human world so in a way it s not even tragic it s beautiful and sad but important for the continuity of dog
he she looks so similar to my dog except mine has white eyebrows from her aging it‚Äôs pretty funny she‚Äôs and a half also not so full of energy anymore but she enjoys laying in the grass outside
i got teary eyed looking at this and reading through the comments my boi is turning this year‚Äì a bit slower and naps a lot more but still healthy and happy we really don‚Äôt deserve dogs
this makes me tear up i have a year old and he is getting so much more white then compared to what he used to have
my year old still has all the energy in the world sending some extra to your pup and to any others who need it pretty sure my dog is going to outlive me
my black flabrador is little grayer than yours his brain doesnt talk to his butt anymore so he sometimes poops in the house w o knowing he still gets excited when the wife kids get home has just enough wiggle left to be adorable
i love this picture you‚Äôre dog is fantastic what‚Äôs his name
i have a yo buddy right now and he is in the same boat he wants to be a puppy but he just can t follow through anymore so we take lots of short walks as he gets a block or so and wants to head home and the wants to play with his toys but after goes he just comes back and lays down we do a lot of belly rubbing now instead
she is incredibly beautiful what loving eyes she has ‚ù§Ô∏è
when i first saw them in just pictures i thought they were so um homely then one of my friends got one and i touched the wrinkly skin and it‚Äôs sooooo soft and he was so affectionate and a good cat i was converted
awwwe i d let it drag my soul to the seventh circle of hell üòç
i‚Äôm sure you love your baby very much but i find her eyes very scary
look at that poor cold angry eyed testicle put a sweater on that baby
i can t stop thinking of dr evil when seeing sphinx cats
i want one of these kitties so bad but they cost about in my area and i am on a stray kitty budget
is that doggo actually just my group project members
this made me laugh so hard my family thought i was having a metal break
‚Äúoh we‚Äôre rolling things i love things that roll my ball rolls ‚Äù plop
i‚Äôve seen this so many times but i just still love it so much
let s go put that silly game away this ball aint gonna launch itself
both of the dice his ball touched turned into six‚Äôs he‚Äôs got good boye magic
i ve got d amp d on the line something about how you managed the cgi

the size difference is so big that i almost thought that was a bear at first
he protecc he attac the mouse but most importantly he respect
no problem kitty yoiu just stay right there and i will slowely back up
he attacc but most importantly he don‚Äôt think cats r wack
reminds me of an old tom and jerry cartoon where spike gives jerry a whistle and tells him if you are in trouble just whistle and everytime he does spike comes in and beats the crap outta tom in creative ways yes i know this is a kitty but he s so small and the dog so much bigger that s why i thought of it
my cat has that little half light colour chin as well it makes her look so silly like she s always pulling a face
sone of these puns make me wanna leave this subreddit
the one turned the opposite direction is clearly the mcu ant man of the group
if it s all the same to you i ll have that drink now
i bet thor is the one cat in the back walking backwards
thor is the one that looks kinda drunk left most hulk is the pissed fellow second from left
tony cat quickly we have to get all them infinity foods dibs on the red one
they look like they re about to go beat up some nasty dogs
every time i see this pic posted i manage to find another cat hidden somewhere i m up to eight now
why hasn t somebody photoshopped an explosion in the background of this photo yet
miau miau miaumiau miau miau miau miaumiau read it like the avengers endgame theme song
they look like they are about to drop the most fire album of
so is the leader catpin america or captain americat
seems more like a catwork orange they are heading to the milk bar
reminds me of you came to the wrong neighborhood motherfucker
this looks like a monty python skit where ladies with handbags terrorize the local population
left to right the smart geeky side kick the muscle and oldest friend the leader the beautiful female love interest
this isn‚Äôt the catvengers this is the cast of breaking cat from left to right mike jesse walt and gus
what human trained eclipse why does she have to go by herself someday she might go home with a human who wants to be involved in her life
when you cross an orange tabby with a lynx and a lion
sooo my cat s cat really needs a cat and your cat looks like a perfect candidate
looks different from the maine coons i grew up with i prefer the old style but this guy is a beauty
maine coon kittens are so weird kitten body adult face love the ‚Äòcoons though
maincoon i got one myself her colour is tabby brown classic
beauty is not to be explained but to be experienced
my name is ron purrman young one what knowledge are you searching for
how did you get an old and wise cats head onto a kittens body like that
those are some seriously robust little paws looks like a mini lynx d
a handsome but proper grump with a conquistador‚Äôs goatee
i can explain the beauty he stands on all fours in a position to attack he is small and young but has the spirit of a lion to which he decided from his whiskers are long white and are bent in all types of ways however one thing stands out the most his perfict fur like the most perfect sunset it bring all eyes towards him the intensity of the corol is huge but still keeping it not overwhelming it complements his posture exactly the expression on his face says that he is the king of the world and that he knows it if you every pass this cat on the street you must sit and respect the holiness that has been placed in front of you so i say to you every time you see this image or in real life respect the fact you are mortal and this kitten is a god to you
i am a bit a simple man i see a maine coon i upvote
had a cat very close to this guy right here was the best pet i ever had sadly he had to be put down due to cancer
he s beautiful in the same way that some people consider ron pearlman handsome
this cat totally looks like scut farkus from a christmas story
looks like a lion that got reincarnated into a cat probably thinks where did the plains go and why am i so smol
looks like the red head bully from a christmas story
he looks like he cant wait to get in trouble any trouble
especially if they re fox bats they are like flying puppies
unpopular opinion here bats will never be cute to me i‚Äôm sorry
they were just on shark tank and they have batman enough is enough
bats are important creatures that don‚Äôt get enough appreciation
funny thing is i know who posts these because he s my boyfriend and says he loves animals on reddit to get karma even though he literally kicks his dogs to get them out of the room and has said he s gonna throw a bucket of water on my bunny they die if they get wet and pretends he s beating hamsters by squealing in the phone and making hitting sounds lol
i love bats they look a little like puppies mixed with a little bit of pig but in a cute way
i hope you didn‚Äôt buy him from a backyard breeder he‚Äôs very cute though i hope he‚Äôs from a decent breeder who treats their breeding dogs like family pets
that‚Äôs got to be the happiest smile from a pupper i‚Äôve seen
my aussie was legitimately smarter and more obedient than my younger brother growing up amazing dogs
i can smell the puppy breath from here and i love it
it makes me want to beat the shit out of this little crap who thinks he is being cute or whatever
looks like a pokemon lol c mon reddit what s his name
i wonder if dogs are like babies and smile before they burp and we don t hear it little fuckers burping in our faces no wonder their breath stinks
so you see that‚Äôs where the trouble began that smile that damn smile
i know that look that‚Äôs the ‚Äúoooh what‚Äôs that ima bite it and see what happens ‚Äù
mini aussie s or just aussie s in general are one of the best dogs i ve ever met next to labs but i m seriously biased towards labs lol
how is this even a real dog omg it s actually too cute üò≠
is there something wrong with the nose or that‚Äôs just a particular pattern
what kind of eye liner and eye shadow is she wearing
i ll let this one slide because i also kept my puppies on my lap on the car ride home the first time but really you oughta get him a crate
soo freaking cuteee thank you for posting this i was in a bad mood and this cheered me right on up ü•∞
imagine taking a second video of your dog and making thousand people smile
the dog looks like a pharoh with that eye liner look don t forget pharohs were considered god s i guess you should try not to offend the dog just in case
humans are the only species on earth that smile i love animals as much as the next person maybe even a little more to be honest but the whole my dog is happy and you can tell because it s smiling thing annoys me it s just not true downvote me to hell again and again i ll deal with it but dogs do not smile because they are happy
aussies are the most beautiful dogs ever so smart athletic and adorable
looks like that one gif of christian bale from the big short
who is giving phones to puppies and teaching them to take selfies
"why does the dog look like it has makeup on xd
not to be mean or anything i mean it s cute as hell"
what it would like if the prize at the bottom of a box of lucky charms was a puppy
dear baby jesus that is the cutest thing i ever seen
i can smell puppy breath from here also all puppy s breath smells the same
that‚Äôs cute and all but is that cleavage from the person at the beginning someone screen grab for me i‚Äôm on mobile
thank you for making my week i saved this and i keep replaying it everyday i‚Äôm sorry that i can‚Äôt give you an award bc i‚Äôm broke
environmentally responsible doggos all that recycled air
the dog on the bottom left is facing the opposite way and it bugs me
breathing someone else s stale air x i can t even imagine
holy repost was this not just on the home page two days ago
she looks too healthy to be a stray lol i have that exact kind of cat it‚Äôs like a siamese rag doll mix
aww if she‚Äôs a stray i hope someone takes her in she‚Äôs beautiful
you can‚Äôt just pretend every cat out and about is a stray
i have the sudden urge to write a song about a shoeless flower peddler that smiles as she walks through town
probably a stray by human standards but i imagine she has a series of regular food stops every day where each stop thinks they re the only ones feeding her other spots that are good for pets and scritches and some usual spots where she likes to sleep i bet if you asked her she would say she s not a stray
that‚Äôs definitely not a stray strays don‚Äôt usually approach people
blue eyes baby‚Äôs got blue eyes like a deep blue sea on a blue blue day sir elton john üéµüé∂
i don t think i could resist a stray kitty like her just sitting right next to me i wish i could have her
that cat would not remain a stray if i was there those eyes would make it worth having a third
a stray she would be a stay i d take her home in a heartbeat
why would someone think this is a stray look at its ears and eyes well groomed
well did you feed her amp x b poor little hungry pooh
prolly not a stray my old gsp used to hang around the neighborhood junior high every day at lunchtime he was no dummy either
that looks like a lion with the head of a cat and body of a cat
as others said that is not a stray its likely one of the hotels farm cats if its a rural hotel will keep the surroundings clear of mice moles etc
ummm that not a stray your hotel happens to be on her prowl route most cats stick to an area roughly to mile near their domicile i have seen you tube videos where a guy puts a gps tracker on his cat feel privileged she stopped by and demanded food from you hooman slave
even the cats here are pompous would you like some salmon
this might be the single cutest picture i ve seen this year it s actually made em less angry look at his her adorable little face
those creatures lifespan is so short poor things no you don t want one of these
heyy l did not do it i have nothing to do with okey
that why it‚Äôs always best to get a pure gs this breed is one that you really can‚Äôt take a chance on being mixed the gs that are here in the states have more issues than the ones from germany
he looks like a normal puppy to me but that might just be the camera angle and the way he s laying still adorable though
what i only see the german shepherd where is dwarfism
vet student here this is considered symmetrical dwarfism pathologically and is caused by a cyst in the pituitary gland which leads to a decreased amount of growth hormones being produced and released into the blood it s true what op says in that these animals have lots of other problems secondary to the cyst
pour some coffee in there and you‚Äôd have a hot cross bunny
well banana is way much bigger than the bunny such a tiny unit
probably should have asked for it frozen and blended because that is not going down
cause of the glare on my screen i thought it was a cup of snake
and i always thought coffee was the best thing in the morning but i was wrong that‚Äôs the best all day long
at first i thought this was a curled up snake in a cup with a big ass head
some countries do drink chew whole baby bunnies when i was in agaro i tried it it‚Äôs ok not great but ok too crunchy
you don t need to put sugar in it because it s already as sweet as possible üòä but you need a knife because a spoon won t cut through
i just want to say that i have that same exact mug but without the cute bunny
morning cup of bunny definitely puts a hop in your step
i had a glare on my screen for a second and it looked like a baby alligator
thumbnail looked like a cup of python i thought it was an inception joke
you better not hop all over the place after you drink so much coffee
looks like a cottontail hope its okay they dont do well in captivity
reminds me of something the teathered folks would eat in the moving us
you re going to drink that bunny you sick twisted individual satire
can t start the day without a fresh cup o cuniculus
looked like a python curled up from the thumbnail was worried this was about a bunny getting snacked by a snake
my grandad said that this is not a rabbit it s a duck
i love to wake up with a nice warm bunny in the morning
the perfect drink to give you a little hop in your step
aren t you meant to blend it before putting it in the cup
surprise surprise happy buns day btw i am hiding from mom don t tell her i m here says the bunny
do you put creamer or milk in yours cause it looks sweet enough lol
put a fishing pole in his and and he looks like one of those wooden tchotchkes
kitty searches the wall for answers nope no tuna there life is heckin difficult
that s such a beautiful coat pattern your cat is thoughtful and pretty
huh i bet i could jump high enough to get out of this place
some real live action bill the cat vibes going on here ack
windmill windmill for the land turn forever hand in hand
if i wasn t allergic to cats this is the pet i would have right here
me when trying to figure out which one of my neighbors is being a late night asshole
when you get hit with an existential crisis on the toilet
in my feed this cat is looking up to the hairless cat in the bath of flowers
omfg this cat is seriously the most beautiful looking cat ever omg
where‚Äôs that picture of a messed up taxidermied fox that sits exactly like this
wait i think the human may be the one controlling that accursed red dot
huh my dog looks sorta like that i always thought he was a chow mixed with corgi but i guess i have a dwarf dog
that dog is cutest thing ever but i really hope he never breeds he has to have some health complications with that smallness
please don‚Äôt promote dwarfism in breeding it‚Äôs very bad for the health of the dog i wish agony and misery upon all who purposely breed unhealthy traits into doggos
of course it‚Äôs not doggers fault he‚Äôs a very good boy and deserves thousands of hugs and pats
alright let s find another one and make a new breed
i have two cats and i can only imagine what your house smells like
his palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy there‚Äôs vomit on his sweater already mom‚Äôs spaghetti he‚Äôs nervous but on the surface he looks calm and ready to drop bombs but he keeps on forgetting what he wrote down the whole crowd goes so loud he opens his mouth but the words won‚Äôt come out he‚Äôs choking how everybody‚Äôs joking now the clocks run out times up over now snap back to reality oh
cat hierarchy system the higher status cats get the better chance to be petted
turns out she s not sick and has been allergic to cats the whole time
this is like a dream i would love to have so many cats snuggling with me
how is your bed so free of cat hair my dad has four and there is hair everywhere
haha i just showed this to my husband and said ‚Äúsomeone‚Äôs put a photo of me on reddit ‚Äù as i sit here with of cats on me i sleep on the same side of the bed as your so and usually wake up with all on or around me good to see i‚Äôm not alone üòÇ
i didn‚Äôt think people who have cats had so‚Äôs there‚Äôs hope for me after all
so how big is that bed i‚Äôve been trying to figure out what number of cats i would need to own to have all available sleeping space taken up on my wife so one of the furry jerks would have to snuggle with me so far i‚Äôve got two but i recon with six my wife would be at capacity that there would have to be at least a cast off kitty for me
dumb french canadian here i apologize but what so mean thanks
is this a weird perspective trick because that bed looks huge
i have too i usually have on the bed with me hairy hot and cramped but i love them
with that amount of pillows and cats that might be the comfiest warmest bed situation i have ever seen
please tell me how you guys keep your sheets so clean and without cat hair everywhere
sick with allergies aggravated by living in a home with cats
you seem to have as many cats as types of cushions on that bed that s a terrible cat cushion ratio you re gonna have to get more cats
how come you get to have cats that get along meanwhile i have weird ass cats that go bonkers every night
nonsense the gravity must be intense the cat density is very high
how is no one commenting on the millions of pillows
i think your so and i would be good friends great job on raising such good kids
if they are warming her then their formation needs work haha btw out of genuine curiosity could the cold get passed from humans to housepets
there is always that one derp cat sleeping or stretching weirdly
my cats do this i have three and when i m not feeling well physicall or emotionally the swarm i ll wake to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night only to realize that i m trapped on the bed
i can t help but see this many animals and think their place must smell bad
looks like the cats take turns then take naps to recharge
seriously question though how do you make your house not smell like cat shit piss all the time what am i doing wrong i have new cats and i can t take th smell
at first i thought u had cats until i read the caption
do you realize how sick a woman has to be to have a cold and be in bed a level cold puts a man in bed for a week she has to be a level
before she opened that book she got snapped back to reality
i applaud your litter scooping abilities i have two cats and its a hassle i couldn t imagine
you should probably get another cat you don t have enough üòÇ
i just can t get behind having that many cats in the house all i can think of is the litter box smell idc what kind of litter you use there s a smell
cats how many times a day do you have to empty the litter box how many litter boxes do you have
i have and thought that was a lot how did you come about your th cat
i m not sure if they re keeping her warm or just thought oh look she s having a lay down what a great idea let s join her
someone is into design that bed look like straight out of a magazine picture textures colors and cats
book should say there goes pee breaks i swear i m always bekittied when i have to pee
how the heck do you get all to get along i have three and they are not friends despite two being sisters
it appears as if you have mastered the craft of herding cats
who the hell says my so that is so unnatural there is no setting where using my significant other is better than girlfriend or wife cats are cute though would rub their tummies
was she casually reading or is this a set up super duper cutie cats btw
look everyone i said so instead of wife or girlfriend woke points to the left
good boys one of my cats broke his leg this week it s being set while i type this and had to stay in the shower to keep him contained while we waited for his surgery my other hung out in the bathroom the whole time to keep him company
oh there goes rabbit he choked he s so mad but he won t give up that easy
lucky her it looks like you couldn t decide which kitten you liked the most and decided to take the whole litter home
stop using plastic water bottles based on this pic i assume you re at home use a glass a cup get yourself a klean canteen hydroflask type thing use the cats watering bowl or the garden hose for all i care stop being part of the problem and don t use plastic water bottles unless it s a necessity not for when you re laying in bed
this is her life now being covered in precious kitties üíï
i have two cats and is always amazed by the amount of poo they poop i can‚Äôt imagine fucking pooping machines
that book looks really good could you even put it down
this is awesome i loathe being sick but i love the comfort from furbabies for sure
my kitties do this too when i m sick they keep very close company with me i love my fluffos
wait a sec you re a man who likes cats all i want in life is a husband and a lot cats everyone has always told me men don t like cats there s hope
are you sure it s a cold she might be allergic to cats
some serious cat spillage on that bed how are you going to clean the stains
totally unrelated to the awesome kitties but that is a nice looking headboard and nightstand where did you get those
is she sick with toxoplasmosis jk hope she feels better
so this is what the net has become people posting pics of their so in bed with a few cats then hundreds of people comment lol i feel for people now days so very lost when it comes to real life
think i m coming down with something may i borrow one
hey super weird question op but with all of these little ones running around what is your cleaning routine like i have right now but i just can t seem to keep their hair under control around the house
how can you people read when sick i can‚Äôt even think or watch a movie properly
i mean if she has a fever then maybe she‚Äôs keeping them warm
all are looking so healthy floofballs üòª all chubgirlsüòò
i would have thought that book would have been written by eminem
is your so reading the chapter entitled mom s spaghetti by any chance it was so riveting that i had vomit on my sweater already when i reached it
this bed looks so warm and inviting i d be lying there too
at what point do cat enthusiasts become crazy cat lady is it or
didn t you mean to say that the cats found a new source of warmth to sap all heat from
i see you aren t a high enough level to unlock two cats and one tail
it looks like the lineup of a fighting game lol the black cats are the silhouettes of characters not unlocked yet
that time you realize you feel so envious and missing out for only having one cat
this is an actual dream i just need two more cats p
i wish i could get my two cats to just lay the fuck down and chill out let alone get this i wish i could get this gt d they just non stop go at it with each other and the older one is bigger than the newest youngest one so all he wants to do it seems is to get at her butt then he gets mean and tries to bite at her still don t know what to do but can t get rid of either one because obviously they re my babies any help tips and i d sure be happy gt gt
my wife wants to be your wife after seeing this picture
cute that they do that when people feel ill or sad them being in the bed though makes my skin crawl all that cat hair all over the bed s not hating on anyone btw let that be clear
oh there goes rabbit he choked he s so mad but he won t give up that easy
wouldn‚Äôt that be ironic if it was really allergies and the cats were making it worse
i can‚Äôt even imagine the complexities of the feline social dynamic that exists among those animals
all the cats in this picture look so content i love it
ahh i see she is enjoying some of marshall mathers literature if she enjoys that book tell her to check out his other book ‚Äúmoms spaghetti‚Äù
am i the only person who can barely keep three cats without them fighting with each other
i am more amazed by the number of pillows than the number of cats
what did she do to get such a great life no seriously i want this
unpopular opinion here especially on reddit i think allowing animals to sleep on your bed is absolutely filthy disgusting and inconsiderate to the people you interact with on a daily basis that have pet allergies i absolutely love love dogs but i would never allow them to get on my bed and dirty it like this double so for people who live with dogs and cats and a square foot apartment
typical cats one working the others all pretending to care
this is so cute but damn please put your cats on a diet they are very obese
my cat will wait until im on my back or side and look at me when i make eye contact he jumps onto my stomach or thighs he then lays there if i give him scratches he will drool on me and shake his head so it goes everywhere once he sneezed right in my face idk if this is normal behavior
i have these at my house we call them cat parties its when of my cats storm into my parents room and sleep on their bed
i have to say that that image transmits something special to me like sounds like a nice goal something simple yet worthy to be fought for
at first i didn t see the cat on her lap and was like wait there s only
i need to know what happened to gravity did we lose it
i m a cat owner and total cat person but god damn it has to be a full time job just keeping that house clean
cat therapy works well multiple cats work even more
all i can think of is how much cat shit that must be do you have a full time litter box maid
"does the book remind anyone of lose yourself snap back to reality oh there goes gravity
oh there goes rabbit he choked
he s so mad but he won t give up that easy no
he won t have it he knows his whole back city s ropes
it don t matter he s dope he knows that but he s broke
he s so stacked that he knows when he goes back to his mobile home that s when its
back to the lab again yo this whole rhapsody
he better go capture this moment and hope it don t pass him"
there goes gravity must be a novel written about how cats always land on their feet i ve seen models for machines that could give us endless power
did she snap back to reality after reading her book
my older cat likes to snuggle with people who are sick after a recent diagnosis of an abdominal infection i spent a couple days in bed feeling really awful and for the worst of it she insisted on getting under the blankets and sleeping against my stomach
that black cat on the foot of the bed is gigantic thought at first it was a blanket
i know i should be looking at the cats but i‚Äôm counting the pillows
i m genuinely surprised at how many reddit users seen to have zoos at home i can t imagine caring for animals i have cat and he is all i can handle
i have a picture just like this of my grandfather hes sitting there reading his book and all the cats are just laying on him
she is so lucky to have five cuddle mates i remember having five like that on the bed with me and it was the best feeling üíô
that looks like the best way to recuperate also the book your so is reading is awesome i just finished it
seems like the other four are mooching off the hard work of the one cat in ur so‚Äôs lap
feeling sick myself atm and the cats have both decided to always be in the room with me instead of roaming the house is it known why cats like to hang out with sick people you would think evolution would discourage that given that if a wild cat was to confort another sick wild cat it would risk catching sick itself
damn imagine reading with both hands thank god i got a kindle years ago
she has a cold and she‚Äôs been in bed for a week seems pretty excessive
my cat growing up wasn t the most friendly or at least not for more than minutes at a time but if you weren t feeling well she d lay with you all day
cats holy litter box and i thought my house smelled terrible after leaving cats alone for the weekend i can t imagine
is your so really short or is that bed just really long
we have and can barely control the amount of hair they shed how do y all deal with it all
book title be like eminem in lose yourself snap back to reality oh there goes gravity
five cats what joy when i lived with my family we had four and two dogs and whew there were a few furry traffic jams so much love in a home how nice
zinc lozenges always help me overcome a cold maybe they might help
happy birthday my little brat just had her first not too long ago too she‚Äôs beautiful by the way give her extra love today
i have a rottie with the same name and spelling but she s
how cool my rottie girl sasha baby just turned happy birthday girl
adorable and paying attention while the candle s lit too
aww happy birthday to the good girl my gf and i are getting a rotty in a few weeks we re meeting him this weekend
the dogs is wondering why you light it‚Äôs food on fire in the left photo
am i the only one that thinks the muffins look like poo
i had a kitten my mom called downy because her eyes were a bit apart and the name stuck but man she was the sweetest cat i had ever seen
my stoner daughter had a dog she named asshole and she called him axle when people me were around
my hamsters called disappointment because that‚Äôs what she was when i saw her
my cat responds to poopie started with putty then pooty then poo poopie haha
my cats name is maggy which became monkey which then became monks
i used to have a big old cat called greydog he hated every other cat he came across until he reached about years of age when our neighbor got a male kitten they just chilled and hung out together they went everywhere together from that day on he was called gaydog
i have a dog that answers to both her name miki and the title of shithead
we got a cat that my dad didn t want my sister named it but dad called it that stupid cat eventually we started calling it stupid for short and stoo when people were around the cat didn t know it was a mean word because we used it affectionately
suddenly bats are the best thing ever what is happening
really wishing i took a path in life that allowed me to take care of sugar gliders
oh that little shuffling while he s working up the courage is adorable
i was so proud of the hesitant one it is me as a sugar glider good job little bud
for a sec i thought they were just kinda far away cats
as cute as they are i heard they aren‚Äôt the best of pets is that true
what you can t see is that he s eating each one before the next one jumps
why are there people with sugar gliders living in their house just curious
i was about to have anxiety if that last little guy didn t jump
yeah you people need to stop posting so much cuteness i don t have any more space in my phone
put these creatures back in a fucking forest where they belong planet going to shit and most of you folks on here going aww where can i get one jesus fucking wept
that second to last one had some adorable tippy taps going on it really warmed my heart omg
as an australian every time i see people overseas with sugar gliders as pets it just makes me irrationally angry
story time i‚Äôll never forget this one guy at a hole in the wall pub i was outside having a smoke and he asked me for one apparently he was just kicked out of the bar for ‚Äúhaving rodents on him‚Äù he revealed three sugar gliders from his jacket chest pocket dude was so intoxicated too weird guy cute sugar gliders though i hope they were not harmed at all by being out at night in the pocket of a drunk man
i don‚Äôt know what the hell these are but i love them and i want about five
i was wondering what kind of species is that and how do you own one
how do you go about getting a sugar glider i ve been thinking about getting one for a while but i can t find one
lol the rd one just completely jumps somewhere else
st airborne jumping over normandy on d day colorised
i m sorry sir but your flying squirrel has a permanent case of the yips
the last one was okokok i got that here i go wait shit okok i am jumping now
play it backwards and you have a sugar glider launcher
that stand looks really close to a cymbell stand ü§î well they re cute that s for sure
‚Äúdo it come on you can do it let‚Äôs goooo ‚Äù me waiting for the last one
no one mentioning the one that missed and the guy pretended like nothing happened
i am ready i am ready i am going to jump i say i am ready go in anytime now ready ready ready
i thought they were squirrels at first but when my they started gliding my face lit up
what plant is that and is it normal for cats to nom them or is this just a weird cat
squrels you joking right squirrels my mind is blown
look at that fruit all over his face i would not have thought a cat would eat something like this or at least not a house fed cat
i ll show those stupid squirrels i ll make my owner blame them for property damage and then he ll kill them all out of revenge
spray them with hot pepper that tends to keep animals away from it
my friend has a cat that loves bananas he will eat the skin but prefers those mushy innards
i wish i could like papaya seeing as it has a bunch of health benefits but that shit tastes like vomit
when my father was growing up his family had a cat named canteloupe who liked to eat cantaloupe
looks to me like he wants you to join him outside very cute
what the heckin heck susan keep the door open i like having the option
he wants you to be outside with him my dogs can t play outside unless i m there to watch them
excuse me rotate this giant see trough square stick thanks
when the dog looks behind him after the door is open no i don t know who was scratching the door say was that the phone
he s planning something next door that he ll need a quick escape from keep that door open and maybe clear a path
‚Äúhey hey open up ‚Äù ‚Äòyes ‚Äù ‚Äúdo you have a minute to talk about tennis balls ‚Äù awkward silence ‚Äúi‚Äôm going now ‚Äù ‚Äúno no wait don‚Äôt close the door aw come on please open up i have something really important to say ‚Äù ‚Äúok what is it ‚Äù ‚Äúi uh forgot see ya‚Äô ‚Äù
my dog does this when she wants you to come outside with her
careful could be an old timey vampire dog they can t enter a house without an invitation
if someone could identify that breed for me that would be great
seems like he s either trying to call your attention to something every time you opened the door he points with his head at something or he wants you to go outside to be with him
yea i got one of those blue heeler border collie mix dog hey man what‚Äôs going on in there open up you need to come out or let me in it‚Äôs time to hears any noise and gets distracted me opens door what‚Äôs up are you ready to come in dog uh i was done doing my thing and what was i going to say me looks like you aren‚Äôt ready to come in yet closes door dog must be nothing hey what closed wtf hey man what‚Äôs going on in there open up you need to a squirrel farts in a far of tree wth was that loud noise me opens door again hey are you ready to hello hello yo doggo dog why is this fool talking to me doesn‚Äôt he hear that bothersome noise i must go investigate prepare my food human i will be hungry when i return
i think he just wants to have that option that he can go inside and outside as he pleases
my previous dog used to do the same and my mom got so pissed every time
had a dog who had to have every bedroom door open door to basement etc in the house at all times was actually annoying as hell
somewhere there‚Äôs a kid in a well wondering why nobody comes to help
i can only imagine how long this game can go on for
when people get blue heeler puppies and people tell them that they are not like other dogs they dont believe and have to deal with stuff like this my blue will open trash can to rummage thru it mind you it has a latch and he knows how to open it
yep can confirm blue heelers are about as smart as year olds ü§£ he s training you there bud
our cattle dog does the same thing glad we aren‚Äôt the only ones with a weirdo dog
he must know my cat who does this constantly i need a pet door
my little chis are the same exact way that fomo is real
someone‚Äôs fallen down the well and you needed to go save them üòï
my dog did the same cute until they don‚Äôt even go outside without you
not an aww moment at all one of my dogs does this exact thing and it is annoying as can be i‚Äôve tried explaining to him how air conditioning bills work on numerous occasions and he just cannot understand such a simple concept
i definitely saw a sup in the right after he opened the door
i suspect that this is actually more like a cat in a dog s body
my dog does this too he either waits for you to go out with him or to call him to you inside
kind of like my cat but it s because he doesn t like when his family is separated like if the door is closed but we re all on the same side of it he doesn t care but if the door separates any of us so if i go to bed early then he cannot tolerate that
i don t want to come in i just want to know that i can
blue heelers are about as smart as year olds and the actual definition of velcro dogs he wants you breathing the same air as him and he‚Äôs willing to train you to make it happen good luck lol but in all fairness my acd is the best thing that ever happens to me he does this to our arm if we stop petting him üòÇ
cattle dogs have different priorities now we just have to figure out what they are
this is hilarious he‚Äôs like ‚Äúum yes what do you need ‚Äù then he‚Äôs like ‚Äúwhy did you close the door i want inside ‚Äù
been spending too much time with the cat bad influence cats
hooman you must walk through the door once you have opened it
my girlfriend wants to get ducks and these were her first two name suggestions üòÇ this picture has sold me
at what time does a duck wake up at the quack of dawn to have breakfast
great duck names total misconception about breakfast
your fianc√© is in on the karma farming conspiracy i‚Äôm onto you
i love duck and quackie so much i bet quackie does all his own stunts too
you keep these post going you understand keep them going at all costs
this is the third post about duck norris and quackie chan and i approve
i love duck norris and quackie chan please keep posting them üòÇ
saw the first post yesterday i think and really appreciate the updates i‚Äôm kind of invested in these little ducklings at this point might start a fan club idk
i approve of the name choices my i add a goose willis next time though
don t wanna be dramatic but i would die for these ducks
the names are cuter than the dang birds i have giggled at every post
i feel like i ve seen these ducks at least times today
they should have their own subreddit i would subscribe
you ve just got yourself a karma farm with these updates
watch out for jean claude van duck he ll shit in the water and sleep in the food
do they have an instagram yet if not they should have one
wasn‚Äôt the concept or breakfast being ‚Äúthe most important‚Äù disproven like a decade ago
i love duck for breakfast seared with egg whites is my favorite lol just kidding great pick and love the names
"how to farm karma post a different pic of your animal on here everyday
normies somehow don t realize it s the same but different picture normies upvote it
free karma"
now they just need a chicken friend named macaulay cluckin
can you please never stop posting duck norris and quackie chan pics k thanks
please keep posting updates about this pair it makes my day
i‚Äôve only known these ducks for a brief time but damnit i just can‚Äôt get enough
nd or rd upvote from me on the damned ducks i don‚Äôt mind karma is free
"i think this is the animal ver of the meme
mom i want this
mom we got this in home"
really missed the boat on naming one of them tucker duck
this should be an action tv show ‚Äú the adventures of duck norris and quackie chan ‚Äù
you re really milking these two karma machines aren t you
follow i shall the even though not the reddit way it be
i love the pun names will always upvote for pun names
quackie chan is arguably the best name for a duck ever
do they have an instagram account so that i can follow them
names alone got my upvote i mean ducks are fine i guess but the names in why i clicked
when duck norris falls in water duck norris doesn t get wet water gets duck norris
not a lot of meat but there s two of them might be enough for a decent breakfast
i‚Äôm already a huge fan of duck norris and quackie chan i enjoyed the surprise of them post immensely as well
i have to say best duck names i ve ever heard bar none
that is a lie made up by big breakfast sweet ducks though
off the dome goose li pond claud van dam and steven seagull these need to happen
you have no idea how much these guys made my day today and yesterday i‚Äôm going to need daily updates for the rest of my life
they‚Äôll be intermittent fasting when they‚Äôre adults
honestly though the internet says that eating two baby ducks every morning is too much
actually technically pushes glasses back up breakfast being the most important meal is a myth
you smug mfer you couldn t resist naming them that take your upvote an go
everyone‚Äôs heard of those chuck norris factoids but let me hear some duck norris quackie chan facts
quackie chan and duck norris has a better ring to it and will look better on a marquee poster
i can‚Äôt stop following the quackie chan adventures i‚Äôm hooked
my mother read a book to me when i was a child called the little duck it had photographs of a toe headed child using an incubator to hatch a duck and their lives together afterward i never thought i d see a cuter duckling until duck norris and quakie chan showed up
i see your reupload haha all three of you count as aww in my book
this is the second time ive ever sorted posts from new instead of hot and i have never been so happy to see reggie more than once
such an adorable mother son portrait your smiles are radiant
man he s a looker i had a reggie of my own for years he was a good boy i m sure this lil guy will treat you well
hi reggie and who is that fluffy handsome boy next to her
why do i hear hi im reggie and have a sudden thought of a white rat
so adorable hi reggie he looks absolutely thrilled ‚ù§Ô∏è
my name is reggie i m about eating treats i m about licking your face and we re about being good bois
i like how someone pointed out that when men post pics like this it‚Äôs just the dog when women post it it‚Äôs them in the pic which technically isn‚Äôt necessary if it‚Äôs actually just to show off the dog
oh damn a lady on a photo on reddit i have no choice but acting weird by asking whats her number to the dog
reggie gonna grow up to be a big doggo cant wait to see more adventures with reggie
i bet he can t wait to play animal crossing new leaf on his nintendo ds
that‚Äôs a weird name for a girl but she‚Äôs pretty cool dog
don t scroll too far down it s exactly as you d expect
hi reggie you look like you have an awesome backyard for this little guy
wow i had a golden named reggie who looked exactly like that he lived more than a decade and brightened every year of our lives with his
single me went straight to the hand to look for a ring zzzzz
i saw this post on aww and didn t even read the comments because i assumed it was clickbait i m more confused than anything than people actually think it s normal for a woman to support puppy mills and backyard breeders don t get me wrong i love pups but there s no need to delve against them a year old can use their imagination like the rest of us did and not buy puppies from assholes
please tell me reggie short for reginald von pupperino or something along those lines
if you brought home a tinder date named ‚Äòreggie‚Äô you might actually be using grindr better get that checked
y all are so sweet together congrats on the new addition
aww look at his adorable smile and cute pink tongue such a cutie
my dog s name is reggie you have to name your dog something else
hiya reggie wheres my animal crossing switch reggie
he‚Äôs so cute and probably reggie for some petting treats
he s gotta go now he s gotta get back to playing animal crossing new leaf on his nintendo ds
that kid would have got his face smashed if he didn‚Äôt catch it
something about that look of pure amazement and joy warms my cold heart
i m happy the kid s face didn t get ploughed by that ball
see this is proper use of slow mo there s a reason for it and it makes sense
a few years ago a fan at one of our local minor league games was killed when he was hit by a ball in the stands i‚Äôm sure that kinda thing is super rare but seeing stuff like this freaks me out a little
that kids gonna get kicked out of the park if he doesn‚Äôt get out of the way next time mlb doesn‚Äôt fuck around with fan interference
oh wow you just did that thing you get paid ridiculous amounts of money to do your my hero
i am not a fan of baseball but seeing that look of total amazement would make sitting there for hours worth it wouldn t matter if i knew them or was rooting for the other team he will remember that always
i imagine a slight exchange of words during this moment ‚Äúwelcome to the fuckin show‚Äù or ‚Äúnot today bitch mitten‚Äù
that kid was a few inches of being rejected from the game and possibly banned for life
kid should have prevented him for making the catch if he‚Äôs a dodgers fan
he wouldn t have dodged this despite wearing this shirt
dear chase i feel like i can call you chase because you and me are so alike i d like to meet you one day it would be great to have a catch i know i can t throw as fast as you but i think you d be impressed with my speed i love your hair you run fast did you have a good relationship with your father me neither these are all things we can talk about and more i know you have not been getting my letters because i know you would write back if you did i hope you write back this time and we can become good friends i am sure our relationship would be a real home run
would have loved to hear orsillo‚Äôs reaction to that great moment
to everyone saying did he give the kid the ball or he should have given the kid the ball the ball is still in play and the kid already has a ball anyway watch his right hand
that kids face would ve been messed up if it weren t for him
oh yeah the game got him for life he will be talking about this
kid needs some fucking glasses the ball would have hit him in the head
you can tell that s a first baseman by the way his glove is
the kid stares at him afterwards like really wow this bitch actually stole my ball
looks like he didn t give it to him what the hell wil
he s not amazed at all he hates it and is thinking omg fuck this moment life isnt fair
that kid was so inspired that he wanted to become a baseball player himself his name babe ruth
this seems like a plot point in a disney movie where the kid decides he‚Äôs going to train his whole life to be a baseball player
i know next to nothing about baseball but if the kid caught it wouldn t he have caused a home run against his own team
stupid fucking kid almost interfered with a play which would have gotten him ejected from the park he should have been cringing dumbass
very nice of the ball player to pause and give the kid a look created a special moment when he could have just turned around and jogged back to the field
did he give the kid the ball i hope he gave the kid the ball
if the kid were to catch the ball was he going to do that trick where he pretended to give the ball by giving the one on his right hand
he saved the kids life that was going right on his head
and he threw the ball into the stands afterwards savage
i don t know if i m just painful blind but it looked like he was holding some kind of lobster with it s legs waving arouns
this was like something out of a mastercard commercial making a kid s day priceless
does anyone else fell like he was dropping his mitt lower just in case the kid did get his in place to catch it
it looks as if he didn‚Äôt catch it for the kid he‚Äôd get recked by the ball lol
a good demonstration why you need to keep your eye on the ball
that player just saved that kid and his parents ticket to the game
i m not american and i ve only seen baseball on tv in american movies the concept of baseball sometimes confuses me it only exists for me in media so most of the time i forget that it is real it seems like it is like hockey but then i remember it is real
euro so no idea who is who but the pro is so quick to judge the path of the ball compared to the kid whose hand was wondering in hope the extra years of hand eye attunement laid bare and the years of training love too that from the kids perspective who was so focused on the incoming ball the pro must have appeared as if from nowhere in the nick of time
not a baseball er here but am i right in thinking that if the kid did manage to catch that it would ve then been out of bounds or something and generally not good for the scores on the points board
why didn t he give the kid the ball dodger player whoever you are i ll remember you when i root against you in some game that i ll randomly scroll past in the future if i m alive oh there s the dodgers yep they should ve given this kid a ball i don t like them anymore now ingrained in my brain go indians
nah look of ‚Äúoh shit i almost messed up and am not getting yelled at‚Äù lol
how is this aww first you want us on board with your shitty babies but this kid is like
probably just saved that kid from traumatic brain injury
hallmark will be in touch soon with the film copyright
saved that kids face from deformation he was way off the mark
ok but did he at least give it to him after he robbed him of that foul ball
this kid is going places he was ready to do the dirty dan with the extra ball in his right hand
same face as the kid in the natural when redford s character takes out the stadium lights with a ho e run blast
that kid is going to love baseball for the rest of his life
i didn t saw the first seconds of the video and thought he would be holding a lobster
then his face turns to disappointment when his parents tell him wil myers prefers east coast mexican food
did he give him the ball if not he should have switched balls with the kid and let him have the one he would of caught
i saved this so i can look at this kid‚Äôs absolute heart warming awe whenever i am especially grumpy
lol that shit would ve hit that kid square in the head
i m super crabby today this just put the biggest smile on my face thank you for sharing lt
the way his mit hand lost connection to his brain p
i d look the same way when a hot guy is willing to catch my balls
the one time i am fine with an adult stealing the catch from a kid
downvote away tell that little dipshit to get out of the way throw him out of the ballpark no idiots on the front row hahaha
little dood already got a ball almost blew the inning for another one not today kiddo
as someone who knows nothing of baseball who is this
and he doesn t give the kid the ball but goes to toss it lt pity
id be amazed that the dodgers didnt blow it at the last second too
wouldn‚Äôt mind getting to know the asian lady behind the kids glove either
his t shirt says dodgers but he sure hell wasn‚Äôt dodging that one
i ve watched this gif so many times now and i still can t figure out where that second ball came from help
did he not give the kid the ball looks like he was about to throw it
wish there was a way to count how many times this thing has been posted
hope this kid makes it to the big leagues one day and then proceeds to strike out that player
he s going to remember that for the rest of his life this is so cool
if the boy would of caught it he would been under a dark cloud of social shame hate mail and resentment for the rest of his life
little boy oh hey thicccdaddy now gimme the ball you
the kid was going to miss the catch looks like the ball would ve hit him so that guy could ve just saved his life
that ball was about to totally crack that kid in the face tho lol
the boy holding the baseball in his right hand hit me in the feels mixed with the shirt and the glove it shows that this boy is a true fan then again i don‚Äôt watch baseball much less go to games so i can‚Äôt say that all kids don‚Äôt do this
haha he went from bracing for impact to ‚Äúyour my hero ‚Äù
i imagine his look being jaw dropping in the way that you d hear them say something like this bitch
thats s kids movies wraped in summation right there
as a dodger fan i‚Äôm upset the kid didn‚Äôt push him lol
traitor if that kid was raised right he should tell that padre off haha
that would have smoked that kid right in the face if he hadn t caught the ball
so would the kid not have been kicked out for catching that is it only when you reach over the barrier to catch right
when i was his age i had the same look on my face the first time i went to hooters
amp with that catch his heart grew sizes that day and then ‚Äì the true meaning of baseball came through and the grinch found the strength of ten grinches plus two
european here is it considered that difficult catching a ball
is it me or does he look kind of like a really young ben affleck
kid closes his eyes and waves at the ball there is a good chance it would have hit him in the head so he s lucky this dude was there to save him
kid if you re a real dodgers fan you gotta knock the arm of a padre player out of the way when he reaches into the stands like that take one off the noggin for the home team
i have never seen anyone get so happy from getting dunked on good for him
find someone who looks at you like this kid looks at the guy who snaked his ball
i think he let him try to catch but when he didn t he was there to save him
ok if the ball wasn t in play i would ve died laughing if he just chucked the ball a few rows back
looks like the same kid that holds that ball he came with to give to girls
player s posture that smile tells me you don t realize how close to fucked up you just were
i‚Äôm pretty sure that ball woulda drilled the kid in the face had the player not caught it
you guys are upvoting a bot farmer pay more attention
maybe if the dude got out of the way the kid would have had a chance asshole
what a stupid fucking kid and the ball would‚Äôve hit his head
aww are you fucking serious this rich little shit is front row has a jersey and and alt hat that little sociopath is going to grow up and patent cancer drugs at k a dose
i don t understand the situation and its agitating me can someone link to me a video of this play
this is adorable but it is giving me a horror flashback to a certain cubs game i m not even a cubs fan not did i care but living near chicago it was a scary time
pure professional for not pushing the kid out of the way
that kids face is priceless that said fuck the dodgers
kids lucky the player was there or he would have gotten a faceful of hard ball
i think he was just amazed that he would actually take a ball from a kid
hes lucky he would have had quite the goose egg on his bean from that
the kid would have been kicked out of the game if he caught it right
to bad the player was probably no to thrilled the kid almost cost them a out it cute and all but the kids parents should have told him not to interfere with play
he saved his life that would have hurt right on the noggin
i hope he got the ball afterwards gif ended too early
amazing display of pure joy a shame we don t see this from adults too often
he saved that kid from a migrane and possible concussion
to the people asking he should have given the kid a chance to catch it yes yes he should have let the kid catch a ball to the face it would have been the most watched clip ever
am i the only one who was only paying attention to the hot asian i didnt even see anything else if it wasnt for the dodgers jersey i wouldn t have even known it was a baseball game
did anyone point out that there was no way this kid would of even caught the ball then it would have bounce off the concrete leaving the kid still without the ball he should be better at catching pop ups to be completely honest
the kid almost blew the play doesn‚Äôt qualify for aww in my opinion
what happened i was looking at that cute asian girl in the back for the whole video
exactly how the god saves us of bolts from the blue
really great but can someone photoshop out the guy and the kid in front of her
it s pretty awesome that technology can capture an entire moment like that yeah pictures are rad but this kid can look back when he s old and have some tremendous nostalgia
i can see the exact moment that this kid became a padres fan
that kid might be the next future hall of fame baseball player that moment might have changed his life
that kid was fully prepared to catch that ball and then give the one in his hand to the cute chick behind him ain t my first rodeo
that kid‚Äôs face says ‚Äúthis man just saved my life ‚Äù
even if it wasn t the player there is a good chance that this kid would be engulfed by zack hample tripping over seats and reaching over kids just so he could catch a ball and feel like a hero handing it to the kid like he didnt just rob the kid of the magic of catching a ball for himself
okay but wouldn‚Äôt that legitimately screw over his team that‚Äôs such a big fan faux pas to try to catch an opposing team‚Äôs pitch foul or not self protective catching is fine but if he was watching his team wouldn‚Äôt he have known that someone was in range to catch it i felt like that player was staring down that kid for nearly messing up his easy out
would‚Äôve gotten beaned in the face too if not for the guy
that kid better be grateful he caught that or he would have a fresh hole in his head from that baseball
may the best player win in this case it was the adult
this may be that boys best memory for many years and we all witnessed it
apparently these guys need regular baths to look after their skin because they still lick themselves like normal cats they get yucky buildup that needs to be washed off
is that what the cat is saying it‚Äôs face looks like it wants to kill everyone and their families
i love how they always look like angry little old people
it‚Äôs like a sphinx except instead of the body of a lion and the head of a man it‚Äôs the body of a slug and the head of a cat
i feel like after his bath hes going to go find a super sayian god to fight
am i the only person who doesn t like this specific breed of cats what s the breed s name by the way
that s a nice slug you got there kinda looks like a cat almost
do these cats typically likes baths and water more than others i always thought that having fur would make baths really uncomfortable but i never thought about these kinds of cats liking them or not
words cannot describe how deeply unsetteling i find this image
correction i was satisfied until you popped and decided to take a picture of my soaking ass rhonda
your going to put this on the f cking internet aren t you
the fragrant liquid warms are pleasing human i will save you for last
i am the loch ness monster you ve searched for take me to my home
why do you put in quotes if your cat actually said this you need to be famous or something
that looks like a cat that had just one fuck to give and that fuck will be gone after the spa treatment
i ve never got to pet a sphinx kitty but the more i see them the more i want to cuddle one
that‚Äôs a lot of milk you gonna drink it afterwards right
oh no i m sorry i wouldn t usually say so that things really ugly not cute ugly like a used face dog just ugly i m sure he she is just charming but is far from making me go aww
how is that roast chicken living a better life than me
why you take my fur karen now i need bath to get warm
ermahgerd i am so going to do this i m going to get flowers and milk just to bath my sphynx like this on her next bath
did cha know sphynx cats originated in toronto not cairo not libya but from canada crazy eh
generally i m allergic to cats but sphinx cats are great because they are like ballsacks that walk arou d and apparently enjoy baths
at a glance i thought the water and the flowers were a bed sheet and the cat had sunk into it
her expression looks like she is about to take over the world one soul at a time
the dark lord would give this poor imitation a hard time
missed the perfect opportunity to say right meow instead of right now
this seriously has to be one of my favorite pictures
do those cats generally not mind getting wet because they are hairless
very satisfied but also i‚Äôll fucking murder you karen
is this that cat that was frantically trying to eat cake or some shit last week is this his reward for not getting to eat the cake
hm never really though about it but are hairless cats generally more accepting of baths since they don t have to deal with wet fur i know some furred cats don t really mind water either lots of individual differences and some breeds even go for swims on their own accord
golem‚Äôs years hiding in the misty mountains were sometimes quite pleasant
not like i m in the bath because i like you or anything
it looks like my cornish you didn t happen to get your rex from a certain well renowned breeder in arizona did you
considering you have to bathe sphynx cats because they will build up oils that fur usually pulls away i m not surprised they got used to it
imagine a being wants you to not ever feel warm that is a human and they purposely designed you like this for money they make money so you can never feel warm aren t they great
that cat is clearly thinking that stupid human is at it again just wait till he s asleep
i read the subtitle with the voice of edna mode from the incredibles
joey that is not a cat rachel yes it is ross why is it inside out rachel i got a cat monica i don t want a cat joey oh don t worry it s not a cat gunther so what is this some kind of snake or something
my husband and cat look at me like that when i m making dinner true loveüíú
it s pretty damn hard to find a girlfriend when you re from am to pm on work and it s not even mentioning the travel time
little did you know i‚Äôm going to eat your face later karen
i have a yellow lab with those same sad looking eyes he looks at me like that sometimes especially around dinner time
i bet it looked at its mother like this before it was captive
i m going to kill you and eat your face but i ll be crying the whole time
find someone that looks at you like when i get bigger i m going to kill and eat you yeah hard no
you mean why do you have me i should be free in the wilderness
oooh honey that‚Äôs cat love there‚Äôs nothing like cat love
wolf stares hungrily at me me awwwww i looooove yooou
i would rather find a clouded leopard that looks at me like this clouded leopard looks at it s keeper
i looked at her like that but i guess that s not enough for some people
the similarities between the look i give my food and this are uncanny
i dont think that look is adoration it s the look of an endangered species hunted by poachers asking why are you doing this what have we done to deserve this
that s how my cat looks at me before he tries to f my face up
my dude looks like hes about to cry from the tail yank
i ve met this lady she is a big cat keeper at the san diego zoo safari park amp she works with their animal ambassadors he s right to look at her like that because she s rad
that s just heart melting i ve never heard of a clouded leopard before
it s because clouded leopards can see your soul and know your pain
as soon as you let go of my tail i‚Äôm going to eat you
i dunno that s exactly the same look that my ex feral cat gives me right before he lunges for my face with teeth or claws it is love but still my face
look at those ears she has a very distinct look about her and it s adorable lucky to have eachother üòä
and like most irresponsible teens i m sure she won t vote but she ll complain about how things are going
i hope all of my dogs live to be old enough to vote and drink strike that i hope all dogs live to be that old and beyond
just try to let her make her own political decisions parents often indoctrinate their children with their own politics it s healthier to let your doggo sort it all out on her own
hell she barely looks nine let alone her actual age give her a scratch for me
just adopted a year old guy and this warms my heart lt
this sounds like it would be a nightmare to deal with honestly
my sister had to put a sign by her mailbox because her cat would crawl inside from a hole in the bottom and jump out at the mail person lmao she had a large mailbox for packages and there was a flap thing in the back for some reason and the cat loved to hang out in the mailbox i dunno my sister refused to fix the issue saying it was his mailbox she was just using it occasionally for her home business so a couple times a week you d hear a mail person have a heart attack and a cat laughing his fuzzy ass off so she put up a warning sign and a jar of treats as an offering to the mail troll eventually the mail people started to love him and the regular usps lady would pick him up give him a ride around the neighborhood and drop him back off at his mailbox of her way out again lol unfortunately peaches is gone now he was hit by a drunk driver and people petitioned on his behalf to have speed bumps put on the road because he was not the first animal killed and kids had been almost hit peaches was the last straw for the neighborhood that loved their mail cat r i p peaches the mail troll may eccentric animals be allowed to live free and live wild scaring passersby with their crazy antics i wish for safety for each crazy animal out there with wierd habits that deserve to be left in peace the peaches law no harmless eccentric animal shall be harassed or bothered eccentric animals are to be left to their own devices and given a wide berth exceptions to this rule include tummy ribs ear scritches treat delivery and other displays of love or approval
dogs love playing king of the hill and i can‚Äôt help but feel like this dog is the master of king of the hill
i walk past this house all the time and look for this dog i‚Äôve never seen it
don t do it huckleberry you have so much to live for
all fun and games till he takes a shit on ur roof üßê
wonder where they put the sign most people won t read for squat or won t read because the dog on the roof will be the bigger distract er good thing about the picture and red letters that eventually fade though there was a molting elephant seal on the beach the other morning there was a sign directly in front with police tape that explained the animal was molting not dead and to leave it alone as beaching required alot of energy and it shouldn t look up every seconds to check for attacks next thing you know this s year old man marches up to the seal ignores everything about the scene tape sign people holding back nudged it with his toe loomed over it with his frame and asked it in buddy voice if he needed help getting back in the water yeah some people heroes can t read for sh t
where is this fantastic and legendary huckleberry roof dog
we also have a gargoyle dog he is too old to do this now but the first time we seen him at the peak of the house we cracked up he loved the vantage point
we had a lab that did that back in the s there was a woodpile near the back of the house and he d climb it and get on the roof so he could bark at people passing by
i had to re read the last line of that note a couple times
my buddy bought a house last year the next door neighbors let their dogs run around on the roof like that on my first visit just as i drove up one of the dogs fell off denting the roof of a minivan on the way down the dog was not moving but still breathing noone was answering the door my buddy and i left my phone number on their door and we took the dog down the street to a vet the dog died as we arrived right after the dog died they called and i had to deliver the news it was heart breaking all around
i love how enough people were concerned about this that they had to put up a sign üòÇ
‚Äúdon‚Äôt be alarmed huckleberry is living up to his name and learned how to jump onto our roof from the backyard we never leave him in the backyard without someone being at home he will not jump off unless you entice him with food or a ball we appreciate your concern but please do not knock on our door we know he‚Äôs up there but please feel free to take pictures of him and share with the world hucktheroofdog‚Äù
you mean your rescue dogs right i couldn‚Äôt give him back
i feel a foster fail coming on look how cute they are together
sorry to be the one to break this to you but i think you have two rescue dogs
you say they are both dogs but i m pretty sure one is a copy cat
i really hope you don‚Äôt have to rehome the foster pup they look like they have such a bond
so the one on the left in the top photos looks almost exactly like my dog that showed up on my doorstep as a puppy months ago any idea of what breed breeds that might be
i can t tell which one is your rescue dog and which is the foster which means you have two rescue dogs it is known
looks like these guys are a package deal now op you now have rescues
i think they ll take at least a silver in synchronized dogging at the next olympics
so you foster failed and now have adopted the cutie
your dog owns the foster dog now you‚Äôre going to have to keep her
the foster probably wasn t confident at the beginning and started mimicking your dog as a way to fit in now they re working on they stage act for a talent show
i think they‚Äôre bonded now so you have to adopt the pup
there is no way you can separate those two pups now report back with an update that you ve adopted the foster please
when i first got my mother a rescued adolescent pup and brought him to her house i also brought my own dog to hang out in her back yard for a while and for some time her new pup would follow and replicate every single thing my dog would do to the tiniest detail sniff the same weed tinkle on the same stick etc it was completely comical
rooting for a foster fail here please keep these best friends together they re just too cute i ll happily send them a big bag of food to share
i mean no pressure but the internet is pretty clear on the outcome here
deep down you know you posted this here to hear the people cheer you on for you to foster fail you know you want to keep the foster doggo the internet has spoken you have no other choice
which is the rescue and which is the foster they look so ‚Äú together‚Äù i can‚Äôt tell which one hasn‚Äôt made it his her home üê∂üê∂‚ù£Ô∏èüòäüëçüèª
my dogs do the same some times i have several pictures of them in the same position weird this is a thing dogs do
that third picture looks like they just got caught doing something sketchy lol
is your dog sad when fosters leave they look like they get along very well
op please oh please tell us that you are adopting the foster
the foster with less white looks exactly like my friends dog
my two dogs look like they could be twins to your pups
my foster failure dog just copied what the other two dogs did and she fit right in i barely had to train her maybe it was a trick
your dog is teaching him the way of the good doggo and the foster is soaking up every word ‚ù§Ô∏è
almost a heart shape in the space between them on the right picture
this is adorable my dogs were close with each other until they got older and then they just fought all the time one of my pups passed away ten days ago and my other dog i thought he d be relieved that he no longer has to fear getting bitten but he s sitting around moping and crying all the time he didn t eat for days despite all the fights andbloodshed they ve really loved each other my poor labrador he s grieving really hard
are you eating a little caeser s pizza on your bed ü§®
little cesar s and a square tv this picture just screams success
people that lay on the mattress directly sigh typically also same person allowing greasy pizza box to rest on bed
sometimes i will just stand here and watch television for hours i love it i love this tv
if it wasn t for the smartphone on the bed i d say this room was from the mid to late s
he looks like he is judging your choice of supper i however am not judging it looks fantastic
if you order in their app and use the code free l you can get a free l with any regular pizza purchase
dude you gotta get the deep dish pizza from little ceasar s instead of the regular one it ll change your life
i asked my husband would you rather have little caesars bread sticks or sex we live hrs from the nearest bread stick
‚Äúwhere are the anchovy toppings i requested human ‚Äù
yo don‚Äôt give a shit how sick you are a box of pizza on the bed trashy
my little caesar s used to have a great deal on crazy bread on a certain day but then they slowly raised the price then got rid of the deal altogether now i never buy it because it feels like the price jumped i miss it
the second u turn around he‚Äôs gonna steal your food
damn that s traumatic to watch i was half expecting none of them to pop back up
one feels like a duck splashing around in all this wet
mom if you i jumped off a bridge would you jump with me me and my siblings mom jumps me and my siblings for spartaaaa breaks legs
i‚Äôm sorry i watched this someone should report that mom to child services
how is this cute they could‚Äôve gotten seriously hurt
i hate mama ducks bitch can you live seconds without putting your babies in danger
wow i d hate to be the last one to jump they look terrified as is
the way he gently tapped her knee for more and patiently waits is just too precious this dog deserves a loving home
i‚Äôm also impressed by this little girls self control after the first gentle tap i would be like ‚Äúüò≠üò≠üò≠ take it all my good boye‚Äù
can this little greedy shit of a little kid just give him the stick of fucking food already jesus
is it really cute to watch a hungry stray dog begging for food üò•
this makes me sad if i could i would feed all the stray animals in the world
she got handed more food for the dog but she eats it herself
am i the only who finds the mouth open eating noises distressing
my dog used to do this when we had food and i found it extremely annoying now she‚Äôs blind and deaf and does it when she can smell the food and find a leg to tap it makes me sad because even if i get up to get something she will sit there and try to tap my leg to find that i‚Äôm not there anymore i no longer find it annoying and just appreciate the love
meanwhile my friends just swoop in and steal my food
plot twist it s the girl s dog it looks quite clean and well fed compared to the one that walks past at the end
my dog does this and it‚Äôs really rude those are my mcnuggets sookie
god i would ve just given it both of the sticks i have no self control
i wish there were dogs i could shelter around me and i didn‚Äôt live in an apartment building where a dog barking while i‚Äôm gone is bad i can afford a dog if i budget better less fun things like restaurant food but i can‚Äôt risk the noise and being kicked out
pretty sure this is philippines theres a lot of stray dogs there
hey there good boy how d you get those great big huge obvious sagging pendulous teats and how did all of reddit miss them d
debbie downer incoming i love dogs and seeing strays breaks my heart but you should be extremely cautious around strays in south east asia they have a huge unvaccinated stray problem and many of the poor things carry rabies which is lethal for humans a year old girl from norway died earlier this year from rabies she contracted while feeding a puppy in thailand an animal doesn‚Äôt have to exhibit any symptoms to be carrying it
i tried to give a stray dog in greece some falafel and fries and it declined it was only interested in lamb they definitely aren‚Äôt starving
and when he reaches the proper weight it ll go the other way around on that very street on that very cart
does no one else find this horrible to make a hungry stray dog wait while this fiasco is recorded shame
reminds me of the dogs in rarotonga super chill polite and friendly
til my dog acts worse than a likely starving stray when he smells food
i was so mad when she was handed another one and didn‚Äôt give it to the dog
in the philippines there are so many stray street dogs askal whenever i visit it hurts to see many of them sleeping in the middle of the street usually in provinces where they are exposed to the fumes from jeepnies and bikes
i worked in india for a few months when i first got there i was nice to this stray dog she would then follow me around town i would walk to work she would follow me i would walk to the bar she would follow me she would sit outside and wait for me pretty crazy all the strays look like the one here but i could tell her apart from the others
the dog is suffering it can‚Äôt see or hear time to go to doggy heaven
fun fact i got my dog from a neighbor in delhi who rescued him when he was a very sick baby street üê∂ dog
dog hey that s my cousin your eating right now i deserve a piece
bruh if this dog came to em i would legit buy of those things for the dog alone they‚Äôre only like cent
i just want to give him hugs and all the snacks he could ever want
saddest thing in the world to see this pup begging for food thailand and other asian places are horrible for dogs dog meat festival is one evil that many are working to end soi foundation is a great group that is working tirelessly for animals in thailand they are other but that one is legit
hope if she currently has puppies nursing she gets enough to nourish them all looks like she was clever enough to learn what works to ensure she gets fed
the sweetest skinny girl followed us around in cuba for a while after we gave her some left over sandwich just so patient and gentle but we didn t have anything more for her broke my heart
this one is pretty for an askal most of the strays i saw were pretty mangey
i think that dog had been abandoned by its previous humans
i had a dog i took in from the streets when he was already about years old and he had mastered begging he had the perfect timing the perfect stare you just had to give him something you could tell that s how he made it that far he had short legs some kind of goatee and beautiful eyes i miss him a lot stray dogs are incredible pets but they have to want to be taken in i always pet stray dogs if they look healthy enough and he pressed his forehead against my leg and followed me home two steps behind very carefully i took him in i bathed him and took him to the vet and he hated both things so much he ran away that night next morning he was at my door and never left again even though i walked him mostly without a leash he stayed with us years until he passed fuck i miss him so much now that i wrote all this thanks for reading
i would give this dog all of my food and then take it home with me
that is the dog you take home cuz it will do anything for you
i cant tell if this girl is or she got that resting sass face
please tell me you took him and bathed him and adopted him what a goood floof
he s probably learned that this is much more effective than being aggresive
it‚Äôs kind of horrible to eat so much in front of a starving dog
what is it with eastern people chewing with their mouths open
such a sweet good boy i wanna take him home so bad and that little girl is so precious i love seeing compassion with animals
you can see his hip bones i will feed you more than food love and care i will feed attention and give your bones a soft bed to lay in when you rest
every god damn time i see a stray my eyes water nothing else gets me close to crying no pupper should live on the streets
that‚Äôs how my lab begs we taught her paw but now she thinks that sitting and putting her paw on you often accidentally scratching you is the way to get whatever she wants but she‚Äôs a very good girl would reward again
when and where was this video taken does anyone know i adopted a dog from thailand and this looks exactly like her and this is her exact demeanor as well
i would have to take him her home and give them all the food in my house everything take it all puppers it s yours i love you love me back
kill one feed the other with it s corpse that s how you raise kids with a good old double standard
oh china where stay dogs have more manner than humans
translation pretend you don t see him just eat he ll ask nicely again
my dog does the same i hate it when it s something i can t give her
my cat does this he wants a bite of whatever i‚Äôm eating all the time constant freakin taps i now use my dog to herd him away when i‚Äôm eating my dog begs by laying at my feet and glancing up at me now and then so it‚Äôs much less annoying occasionally she rests her giant head on my leg and sighs
this reminds me of when i went to peru it hurts so much to see people and animals struggling to make it through the day with people selling what they can in one of the markets on the street and animals begging for food or sleeping on the sidewalk i wish i could help everyone it hurts to see this especially having a cat i‚Äôm so glad i was able to give him a good home and he‚Äôs one of the best things i could wish for
at least the stray dog can chew with its mouth closed fuck you can hear the woman filming this smack smack smack smack
my cat abandoned as a youngun does this not going to lie it wins my heart and food every time
i love her little ‚Äòdamn this ‚Äòbab slaps‚Äô head shake
a year old norwegian girl recently died of rabies trying to rescue a puppy careful with strays
my pup refuses to sit next to me while i eat he wants to stay on the floor give me puppy eyes shake and whimper poor kid is conditioned from being in the streets
hmmm there‚Äôs a bunch of puppies this dog has to make milk for
i noticed you have some meat would you be so kind as to share with me please
the one thing i hated about thailand is all the stray dogs it s sad i remember we were walking over a small bridge that went over a drainage ditch in bangkok and there was a dog along the bank of that ditch she looked like she had puppies somewhere and just looked so lost it s really sad but in phuket there s a vet who goes and puts out food with tranquelizer in it and collects the animals fixes them and then re releases them
when i visit my parents home my little girl always follows me everywhere when i sit down in the kitchen table to eat something whether its a meal or midnight snack i always sit her in a chair besides me and she taps the table edge with her paw to ask for food i find this adorable and obviously i give her some i even separate some food to give to her while i finish mine
give him the whole thing you bitch he s a good doggo
at the dog park one day all of a sudden no dog the dumb mutt is a hundred yards away begging from a woman who had a hot dog yeah she gave him a bite
two things give the dog the food you little shit stop eating it yourself on second thought what if this is in korea and that dog just became a cannibal
my dog does this except from a distance so it looks like he s waving hey over here
my kids aren‚Äôt this polite during dinner and they never go to bed hungry
i can just see the foot tap behavior reinforcement compounding
i d like to remind everyone never to give a dog chocolate they can eat almost everything we can but chocolate is poisonous to them they can go blind or even die from it do share non chocolate treats tho because good boys deserve it this has been a psa thank you for listening
plot twist this gif takes place at the yulin dog festival
i d beat the fuck out of this dog if it ever tried it do it to me
this dog isn t polite it s aggressively begging in a world it realizes can be hostile it is timid but consistently without regard for that which it is begging from sry dawg
aaaand that s when i would come home with a dog from the market lol
nothing polite about this just pushy and annoying didn‚Äôt even say thank you at any point
i hope this good girl gets as much food as she can possibly eat she has puppies look at her belly her nipples are swollen with milk
this is a skill that a dog has over all other animals it can communicate with humans since it learned that it s been easy street all the way
"rough translation from tagalog bigay mo siya give him kakalabitin ka yan he will touch you oh kain ka ulet here eat again kunyare kakain ka act like your eating kakalabitin ka ulit nyan tingan mo he will touch you again you will see wag mong pansinin hah dont give him attention wag mong ulit pansinin dont give him attention again
sige bayaan mong kalabitin ka lang let him touch you by himself
oh kain ka pa oh keep eating
laughs wag mong pansisin dont give him attention
wag mong titingnan dont him watch
konte lang ang kainin mo only eat a little bit seems like the tone is playful but not malicious also i just put he as the dog s gender because the words spoken gives attention but is gender less"
it s kinda funny her mom kept telling her to not post attention to it and not to look at her dogs do this a lot i believe in philippines
i live in a city of mexico a few minutes south of california usa there s food trucks carts all over the place and stray ferrel dogs roaming about whenever one of them waits nearby i ll order an extra plain taco or two and feed them the meat they always gently grab the food and you can tell they appreciate the fact they aren t being shooed or kicked away you get attached in such a brief amount of time
is it wrong that i want to hit the girl for eating before sharing when she got the second stick
they get a shit load of attention from people who are both pro pitt and against
not the dog its the human behind the dog that is the problem
i can smell the puppy breath through this picture so cute
fun fact the term pitbull actually comes from when these dogs were fighting bulls in pits originally hunting dogs for larger game they were bred to grab and hold that is where the term ‚Äúlocking jaw‚Äù came from later they became known as nanny dogs due to their fantastic ability with children now they are mostly used to hunt wild hogs in rural parts sadly people are forcing these dogs to fight in dog fighting blame the people not the breed
all puppies are kind of blobby but pit puppies are the blobbiest of all
i just had a patient come through that needed stutches on his face he said an week old pitbull bit him its crazy how much damage they can do even at such a young age
who hates pit bulls they re dogs like all others fucking chihuahuas are asses not these cuties
i think all pit bulls need more attention still needs work to destroy the terrible stigma of being killing machines
i personally think pits are beautiful dogs that rarely if ever deserve their bad reputation
i ll take the one that is trying to monch the others snoot
pitbulls are crazy at birth one is trying to eat the other
vicious killers everyone they are killers because it s killing me not being able to pet those pups
omg did i actually make it before the thread gets locked this time yay adorable and i want all of them thanks
every time i come to this sub its this overrated ass breed
who downvotes this is gonna wake up next morning with no knee caps
yeah if they got more attention maybe they wouldn‚Äôt become such vicious killers
they are by far the cutest and physically perfect puppies of them all everything on them is well proportioned
those horrible creatures do not belong on this subreddit a scary pit bull could easily kill a human being with their adorable faces and loving personality hahaha
all puppies are beautiful take my upvote to all the downvoters you can just scroll away bye
i ll pay you dollars if i can spend minutes in that pile of wonderful
what kind of maniac is not giving pit pups attention
felt cute might rip out a toddler s throat ladder idk
aww they haven‚Äôt gotten their first taste of infant or elderly flesh yet
this is a karma poster they prob don t like pibbles at all
there s a hell of a lot of pitbull haters in this thread fuck ya ll and downvote me into oblivion if you like dogs and met either of mine you d learn to love pitbulls
don t embarrass him her but tell that horse quietly that it left its pyjamas on
but is it white with black stripes or black with white stripes
certificate of achieving the most pissed off face he could muster
‚Äúcurrently having sex here‚Äôs a picture of us right before we sexed‚Äù
he is the lucky one congrats and have a long happy life together
wonderful much happiness to both of you and i m guessing that those mountains in the background are not oklahoma
congratulations i honestly and sincerely mean that i believe that everyone has a someone that being said and i realise i m being the asshole no one else wants to be wtf is going on with that forehead
gt things that make you go aww like puppies bunnies babies and extremely vane humans
how come these kind of posts always have a lot of upvotes and almost only negative comments
as long as you re making friends with strangers where are you registered where s the reception and what will we be eating sharing with strangers must be something more than just humblebragging on the wrong sub right nah we still don t give a shit stranger you re not special and there is nothing aww about this you re uninterestingly normal now take a downvote
i love the idea but my cats are sorta clumsy and i can just see the one that rides on my shoulder jumping and attempting to land on me
why does this remind me of a level of super mario that i couldn‚Äôt beat
it s really neat but my cat would just look at it and then go to sleep on the sofa
i imagine walking under that is risky i ve seen too many videos of cats screwing up their jumps
holy hell that black cat was hanging on by a claw i wish i was as fearless as these cats oh well back in my bubble
i always thought indoor only cats was cruel to the cat this is the first setup to ever change my mind
this is why i am not allowed to decorate a house by myself it would totally be every room like this love it and so would our cat and reason to get more cats üò∫
i love this but if i put this in my cat would ignore it
this is a cute idea but with my medium hair cat this would be a huge pain to vacuum daily
i don t know why this is so funny looking to me but it has me laughing pretty good
my cat would be the tard trying to catch a wall butterfly
imagine sitting in this room and suddenly a cat drops onto you
that s really cool until you notice the smell where your cats have puked shit up there
i would be so scared my little idiots would kill themselves
pretty sure my cat would end up stuck to the bottom of one of those mushrooms and meow til someone rescues her
my cat would just constantly miss and land on my head
til we didn t know what cats really were this whole time
a lazy creature that is effortlessly athletic it s just not fair
your personal bubble is also kitty‚Äôs personal bubble
i wonder if cats lay on top of people in a show of dominance ownership like dogs
i m hoping that the stray we are making friends with in hopes he doesn t mind just being ours becomes like this
cats do all space is their personal space why else would they get so offended if locked out of a room
welcome back to personal space i m your host phillip jacobs and let me tell you i care about my personal space whoa whoa hey whose around me right now whose around me
all my cat knows is his personal space and the rules are don‚Äôt go near it
i have cat allergies this is my nightmare cute though
this makes me miss my face hugger so much although breathing at night is still a bit novel
it certainly does have the concept of personal space your personal space is it s personal space dogs have similar notions it also understands that humans have hands that the purpose of hands is to provide stroke and scritch and it will train you to do so on command you don t own pets they own you
mine does the same damn thing it s very nice when you feel cuddly but at am when you are tired af it s a little much
all cats know nothing of personal space lol because they see everything as their space
error it does have concept of personal space his conception is your personal space is his
your cat is gorgeous and now i feel like i‚Äôm on the same level as a potato
how did you get him to hold still with that on his head omg he is stunning üòç
goodness what a beautiful cat ‚ù§Ô∏è impressive that they re so photogenic too i know my cat particularly dislikes getting her picture taken and will move when she realizes i m taking pictures lol
‚Äúgoing to meowchella feeling cute might do some catnip later‚Äù
that s leo mainecoon he s on instagram leomainecoon
first i thought it s my cat second thought i can t take photos with this quality finally oh this cat wears flowers it cant be mine
the posters for midsommar are really starting to go off the rails
who cares about the provenance of the photo isn t this picture absolutely adorable i would die happy if this was the last thing i saw before i died
wow move over rosie stathum this beauty is prettier than you and that s says a ton
claire likes beach walks and frappacinos toootally can t wait to see odesza again
how shitty is it that people have to watermark their cat‚Äôs photos
this is the prettiest cat i‚Äôve ever seen when finals are over and i have some spare time i would love to paint him if that‚Äôs okay
yes your angle is acute i love this picture and your kitty
it is an acute angle get it acute angle no ok i ll show myself out
have they learned nothing from daniel tigers neighborhood
when you feel so mad that you wanna roar take a deep breath and count to
that s because he s a golden they are sweet to everyone
he wanted to watch a cartoon about dogs but clearly the cat won
being unwilling to use your substantial strength and bulk to crush those smaller than you is not cowardice it is kindness
was walking the neighbor s gsd just about lbs and stopped for a drink on the way home he checked the place out and was wandering around oblivious to our cat making airplane ears at him from the chair when he suddenly noticed the cat screamed and ran for the back door the cat was very much in what in hell just happened mode gunnar the gsd is also scared of snowmen otherwise the happiest dog i ve ever seen he spends his life finding his next friend
dog well okay then i guess if ya feel that strongly about it ‚Äú
it‚Äôs the same in our house except the cat is old and the dog is a new
it s not the size of the kitty in the fight it s the size of the fight in the kitty
i d your golden retriever really lbs dude that s really fat
look at the arched back tho kitten is actually v big
at first i thought the title was referencing the tv in the background i may be a little tired
i mean it‚Äôs face is oddly cute in a weird sort of way
why did you do this to me it would have cost you nothing to just not do this to me and my own eyeballs
what the fuck what the fuck aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
i feel like roman or greek gods are such good dog names
i can t handle the cuteness he s too damn perfect i m jealous of the years you guys have ahead of you
oh his furry little face he is adorable have fun together
does he have small legs and arms the angle at where the photo is taken makes his proportions look odd
it looks like you re going to have a serious cute problem for quite some time happy for you all
yes zeus is s gorgeous puppy heaven help your heart üòÅ consider his nose booped üòÅ
read this too fast and thought it said jesus at first üòÇüòÇüòÇ
he s very pretty and quite handsome i hope you have a long and blessed life together with many great adventures
i had a dog named zeus now we got a new puppy and named her artemis
congratulations on your newest addition to your family he is without a doubt an adorable floofy pup thank you for sharing such cuteness
jesus christ that dog is legitimately the most beautiful dog i‚Äôve ever seen
that s a very impressive nose and a gorgeous pupper
that pup looks like he is about to boop you for using your phone and not snuggling him and basking in his glory
cute but serious about it love it i m cute you understand do you understand now belly rubs
üòç reminds me of my good girl b√©b√© chow chow german sheppard mix who we rescued from the pound the day before she was to be euthanized best doggie ever zeus is a lucky boy
this repost pops up every week or two i m not against reposts at all but i ve seen this particular post on this sub times myself
if my cat could do this i would never accomplish anything
ah yes i have fond memories of growing up the halcyon days of my youth when my best friend and i would sit on the dirt and pet our lemur
ever seen the teeth on these guys better get to pettin
so you basically have to take your hands and put them here
for some reason when i do this my friends and family don t think it s so adorable
that s every woman ever when you stop rubbing her back even if your hands are cramping and you just want to go to sleep
damn i wish i was wealthy enough to have a pet lemur
poor one kid seemed to motion like his arm was starting to get tired
adorable that is a step away from being dictatorial
those kids have been petting that lemur for days they‚Äôve been held hostage send help
too bad they will probably skin it and sell it at the local bush meat market later on
after filming madagascar king julian went on vacation
this lemur wants something be cautious though lemurs are tricky creatures
i broke my leg once it itched and i couldn t scratch it drove me crazy then a friend told me to stretch a cloth hanger and use it to scratch when i first started it felt so god damn good i wanted to cry i imagine animals that get scratched in places they can t reach feel the same level of joy
i needed this after seeing that video of the kid trying to take the puppies away from the mother
people can learn a lot from the animal kingdom when you make something seem like a question there s the chance your question will be answered with no when you make a statement the underlings will jump to follow your command this lemur knows more about human nature than humans do
almost looks like a job hahah that kid definitely wants to quit
that s how my girlfriend tells me she wants pets too
i read that first as more than pets and it still made sense
an animal with the ability to point to a spot on itself and use basic sign language to have people understand it is pretty fucking cool zoboomafoo i thought you were simple and liking jumping and garbonzo beans only
on the rear damnit i didn t star in a disney movie for nothin
keep scratching goddammit this is ridiculous are these kids idiots
these little adorable monkey raccoons ate my favorite animal of all time
helllo i still have parasitic insects biting me you two are the worst lemurs ever
oddly specific but petting a lemur is kind of on my bucket list do they just hang out like feral cats in madacascar if i just fly there one day could i make this happen
selfish the kids look like they need a scratch too ya know greety lemur s
my dog just gently puts my hand in it s mouth and attempts to move it towards it s back
or more like hey i got these ticks and fleas that are bugging the crap out of me keep scratching oh and sorry if they bite and infest your lol
i wonder if there s some evolutionary reason for this oh my god were we made to pat furry animals
lemurs are literally the only primate that i think looks cute
king joffrey reincarnated he he he come on kids who told you to stop
‚Äúi‚Äôm trying to get more pets but i‚Äôm dummy thicc and the clap of my asscheeks keeps scaring away the kids ‚Äù
unpaid child labor is not cute there‚Äôs one part where i thought the boy in the light shirt was holding his arm up because it was tired i‚Äôm pretty sure he was just scratching and itch but the way that lemur is giving out commands i wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they‚Äôve been at this for hours
i‚Äôm pretty sure the internet is static only thing being added is comments to stuff that‚Äôs been here for years and reposted every weeks
my dog communicates this by punching me in the face
i don t know man this looks like the same way i let people know i want more pets and i m not really adorable
i feel like this is me when i want my bf to spank me
day i have failed to reject the null hypothesis the children will pet me if i tap my back next i will attempt to get them to give me belly rubs based upon front pats
this lemur would love the way i give hermione a rubdown i was taught by a thick furred blue cat to give rubs amp scritch scratch she tells me by vocalizations amp staring intently lemurs are one of my favourite mammals
i don t think i have ever seen this posted where it went all the way to the second butt tap incredible
the news be like white supremest lemur forces african children to obey his orders
my three legged four pound chihuahua lets us know that she wants more pets by ‚Äúwhacking‚Äù us on the nose with her only front paw whenever we stop petting her
adorable until you realize he s been holding those kids hostage for years
this is quite similar to when my girlfriend suggests i scratch her back hmm
little kid gives the look of man i didn t realize what i got myself into
those kids are getting weird ticks and lice my body itches seeing it but so cute i want one for approximately the length of that video
add lemur to the list of animals i want to squeeze until their eyes pop out
it‚Äôs like sex after years of marriage demanding nonverbal unromantic
stripper has an adorable way of telling you she wants more singles
humans are silly i usually have to give some food to my forest ferret friends to scratch my back
must be smart to be able to recognize they would even respond to that
i wonder what happened to most of that lemur‚Äôs tail they‚Äôre usually much longer and have more rings
this has the same energy as the otter that asks the owner for more pets
is this video popping up from different angles or is it being reversed i feel like every time i see it it looks different it‚Äôs always still upvoted from me though ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
kids are like please i want to stop i want to go home i miss my family
cute most videos i‚Äôve watched of lemurs they always do this if you stop
my cat does this he loves having his ears and neck rubbed he‚Äôll lay next to me and pet himself for a couple minutes while maintaining eye contact the whole time
last time i saw it was on ebaumsworld when it was still cool hilarious
my girlfriend reacts similarly when she requests i keep giving her attention a couple slaps on her own butt
even though there‚Äôs no sound i still hear whap whap whap when he gestures for his back
king julian doesn‚Äôt need this other animals anymore he has some new servants
smack that all on on the floor smack that give me some more
he looks like that dood from the madagascar i like to move it move it
so basically this lemur is a scp that forces a man to pet him for the rest of his life
i see you trying to pick your nose but could you scratch the parasitic mites off of my ass first
this is me when my husband is rubbing my feet and legs and suddenly stops üòÇ
i wonder if the kids gave that signal would the lemur start petting them too
this is me when my boyfriend stops stroking my back before i give him permission to
i‚Äôve seen this before but that doesn‚Äôt make me love it any less
in king julien‚Äôs voice i did not say to stop continue with the rubbing and get me a little bit on the back it‚Äôs so tight around there
actually the lemur is just rubbing off their scents sorry
king julian taking hostages not a surprise i like to move it move it
redditor has an adorable way to let other redditors know they want to farm karma with a repost they repost
i believe that s lemur sign language for keep skritching i m still riddled with parasites
not all lemurs like getting petted i tried to pet one when i was a child and it bit my hand
i ve been saying for a while there is an imminent need to distribute more smartphones across africa and other poor parts of the world we could be swimming in primate antics if video capability were more widespread across the continent
hey do that thing you were just doing right there thank you
master lemur has ordered you low life humans to pet him
and big science thinks we evolved from these munkies ya rite s
dude lemurs are my favorite where can i fucking go to pet this good boi
lemur‚Äòs are very territoriale and mark their territorium by scenting their surroundings the technique they use is to smear feces in their soft coat of fur
i‚Äôve seen this multiple times posted on reddit but each time i watch it i‚Äôm still amused
this is my girlfriend when she demands i touch her butt
i love how gentle the kids are with the lemur a lot of young kids smack animals instead of petting them wholesome content
normally i look at comments on threads like this to find out why the animal doing a cute thing is actually in pain or something is wrong with it and we‚Äôre all a bunch or jerks for thinking that it‚Äôs behavior is cute and i didnt see that comment yet so thats nice
i thought king julian was a made up character in madagascar turns out he is alive and well still living like a proper king ought to
anyone else think this was a raccoon until they read the title and looked again
lemurs are cute but ya know what isn t cute koalas i fucking hate koalas
i showed my kid this like a year ago when he was and at the height if pretending to be animals so he would mimick the lemer asking for pets and would say i m a lemer
it s like my young son scratch my back mom for the st nd and rd time
wow zoboomafoo sure has gained some weight in retirement
me with my husband every night when he stops petting me umm excuse me you ain t done lol
me mom can we have a lemur at home mom we already have a lemur at home lemur at home meeeeeeeow
counting all the reposts how many upvotes do you think this has gotten i‚Äôm going to guess close to a million
when i was a kid i used to think the actual name of this animal was zoboomafoo
i m here to eat food and get pets and i already ate all the food
"üéµhe likes the scratches scratchesüéµ
üéµhe likes the scratches scratchesüéµ
üéµhe likes the scratches scratchesüéµ
he likes the scratches"
finally some kids who know how to pet an animal there s way too many kids i know that just want to pull a dog s ear and terrify a cat i had a child hit my rabbit in the face these kids are rare heros
me telling my girlfriend i want more back scratches
so uhhhh is that a giant tennis ball or a really tiny dog i m very confused
you re the best who are the sick fucks that do that to animals
im trying to figure out if that dog is really small or if that ball is really big
you re such an amazing human to do that thank you for saving her this just reminds us that although there are horrible evil humans out there there are good people like you too sadly there are more evil people than good ones god bless you and may you save many others who are in need of you
what a girl i too am glad you rescued her i often wonder if they hold on to trauma the way humans do is her other eye strong or has it been injured too so glad she has a cushy life
animals amaze me in their resiliency i am so happy this story has a happy end makes me sad for those who do not an upvote for folks who adopt not shop
get that pup a puzzle bowl it s cute as hell but he shouldn t eat so fast he might hurt himself it s common among beagles
aww look at the little potbelly i love puppies they make me happy
so cute but as a dog owner so much of this makes me cringe
i like how he was instantly awake when he heard the food
yeah this shit won‚Äôt be cute for much longer good luck
"i find his hunger and desperation adorable as heck s
seriously cute tho"
lol it didn t want no ration sized it wanted the source
omg we had a beagle and he was exactly like this he always wolfed down all of his food instantly had zero chill
i wish i could have seen my beagle as a pup i‚Äôm sure she‚Äôd have behaved the same way
i love this one every time i see it it still melts my heart lt
op posts one video and suddenly we are all beagle experts
sleep sleep sleep sleeomgfoodfoodfoodfoodfoodfoodfoodfoodfoodfoodfoodfoodfoodfoodfoodfoodfoodfoodfoodfoodfoodfoodfoodfoodfoodfoodfoodfoodfoodfoodfoodfoodfoodfoodfoodfoodfoodfoodfoodfoodfoodfoodfoodfoodfoodfoodfoodfoodfoodfoodfoodfoodfoodfoodfoodfoodfood
he was only borned a little while ago so he only know like three things and food is his favorite one
aweeeeee so cute but you better star teaching her some food manners
i hate this no reason or excuse for a pup being that frantically hungry
oh good god that reminds me of our little beagle when she was a puppy scent hounds are very motivated by food üòÑ
omg i wasnt expecting the rocket inside the jar and i skweeeed
hahaha head straight into the container absolutely adorable
i see these puppies eating so fast and then look at my pup who watches me pour his food and give it to him just to look at me and walk away cus he dont want that shit
you can tell by the way it wagging its tail its in pain
one of my friends used to stick her fingers in her doggys food to train him not to eat as violently and fast
from nought to fooodamgfoodmyfoodmineminemine in seconds
did they just get back from an eye exam those pupils dilated
i love these cats but can anyone tell me what breed this cat is

kitty s face looks like its saying help me blink twice if you need help kitty
hi torres you are doing a great job at converting op to cat person status seriously the orange ones are the best
congratulations you ve had a cat for years welcome to the club we have catnip and feather toys
i am confused what exactly is your definition of not being a cat person
not cat people have just never had a cat before like they ve tried to get cuddly with someone else s cat but the cat wasn t into it because not their human someone put it as you going to your friends house and meeting the wife for the first time and expecting her to just sit on your lap that would be weird wouldn t it you must earn the trust of the kitty
i‚Äôm not a cat person either but that fellow sure looks amazing and loves you
a name i ve wanted to name my future big dog is hudson

im trying to think of a clever endgame reference but i cant except for the fact that that is super cool
all fun and games until some kid starts talking shit and he snaps him
epppiiicccc there is no one who would mess with you now since u can snap em out of existence

the nanotech gauntlet would have been better spoiler

well you know what they say about elephants elephants never forget
here‚Äôs to a long happy retirement together for these two friends
my after not seeing my favourite pillow for a whole hours
elephants truly are amazing creatures theyre so intelligent got the opportunity to get close to one when i was on holiday in africa unfortunately i m dummy thicc and the clap of my ass scared him away
i love the faces elephants make when they re happy they seem so contented
how anyone could bring harm to these beautiful animals is baffling to me
they‚Äôre just celebrating that they were spared from got season
great tearing up at work i wish humans would just leave elephants and their habitats alone
my heart build your own clan and love them hard it doesn‚Äôt have to be all made of blood family pick good people and just be there for them let them do for you too you will need them and they will need you it‚Äôs a life‚Äôs work it‚Äôs grand lessons i just got from elephants love with all your might and never forget that love
well i guess it s time to read modoc true story of the greatest elephant that ever lived again
the fact that they remember and recognize each other after years just shows the intelligence they have
not trying to upset the sweetness of this post but this reminds me of when my mother in law saw her sister for the first time in years
looking at the trunk on trunk action is that allowed
oh my gosh they‚Äôre hugging with their trunks how cute
god i really need to stop cutting onions at at night
you know what people say about elephants they re big
hello old friend i have not forgotten and nor have you
the longer i look the more i realize elephants are weird as fuck
is there science behind why elephants are so much more affectionate than other animals i‚Äôve even heard they hold ‚Äúfunerals‚Äù for their dead herd members or that momma elephants can go into depression and die if their young are killed die
did anyone else have a really hard time reading and or watching water for elephants because of the animal cruelty
i don‚Äôt care how many times this is reposted i love it
my best friend and i after a semester at different colleges
there‚Äôs still humans that believe that other animals don‚Äôt have emotions you can believe in god with no proof but animals having emotions is too much of a stretch
there is an elephant sanctuary in tennessee booking a flight and a hotel now
there is so much we don‚Äôt understand yet it‚Äôs right there in front of us
humans don t even have this level of recognition or affection even for their own family we are really quite base and inelegant when compared to the elephants
i cannot stop watching this it is so heart warming and heart breaking at the same time so glad they are together in a better setting now
this is making me cry dammit these majestic animals should never have been taken from their habitat to begin with i m grateful they re finally free and together they are family lt
elephants are one of those few animals that i think are intelligent enough to fell love for real
they are super relieved about not being at king s landing on sunday
man can be such a piece of work keeping these beautiful creatures apart for so many years

my wife was pretty sour with me when she wanted to watch the greatest showman and i went on a rant about how terrible the circus is to animals
now i‚Äôm crying üò≠ hoping for many more happy years together for them ü•∞üêò‚ù§Ô∏è
god i fucking live elephaaaaunts edit love them too
its astounding how intelligent these animals are also fuck the circus
the ignorant morons who say animals don t feel the way we do that s the good thing about the internet we see the proof those people are ignorant morons every single day
just think of all thr trauma they lived through togetherüò≠ now they can finallu be happy in peace
it is criminal that we deprive not only our citizens but also animals ‚Äî who cannot explain their imprisonment ‚Äî healthy and abundant lives
to all people visiting circuses who use animals don t
elephants are strong intelligent and sensitive only an asshole takes whales and elephants to be used for circus slideshows
do elephants wag their tails like dogs do or is that just a coincidence
this is literally a soundless gif of two elephants touching each other with their trunks then there s op s story about how they ve been appart years and have now reunited
as happy as i am for these two i hope this doesn t happen anymore i wish we could just keep animals together as long as they get along it s so wrong to seperate creatures that clearly care and have a bond together and fuck the people that say animals don t understand i had neighbors who raised beautiful huskies together for years the one a little older than the other when they both grew old the older one died and was buried in their backyard the other would cry to go outside all day and lay where they buried her elephants will revisit elephant grave yards and all gather around in mourning of the elephant that died in that spot animals remember they may not have a cohesive language to communicate with us or each other complexly but they clearly remember and they clearly feel
we ll always be friends forever won t we yeah forever
is it wrong that i m curious how all that grass and dirt got on his back i mean what is he doing just walking around ripping up sod and throwing it
i kind of wish i had an elephant buddy like that though my dog does something close
would be cool to see the first time they realized who each other was i bet they were pretty excited
shirley was my elephant growing up she was my favorite part of our local zoo and i always felt bad as the keepers did that she was stuck in a zoo they bought to keep her safe until a better situation could be sorted out but it took a lot longer than anyone could have expected i was ecstatic when this video went viral
this is why i struggle with elephant hide clothing like boots
this reminds me of these two elephants at the circus that were conjoined only they were connected at the trunk i felt sorry for them especially when they would sneeze when they did they d go aaaaaachooo snanork rip tim
that one elephant is getting a little nosey down there
i wonder what they talk about eating plants n stuff
enough of that i m drunk as hell and i ll be damned if i m gonna let two elephants make me cry tonight
humanity is such assholes to such amazing creatures
i love elephants so much it s so sweet seeing them cuddle like this
man it s shit like this that makes me think that humans have gotten a big ego heavy on the whole alpha species thing cuz this here is far too human
love these sweet souled gentle giants let them live free
i love elephants i really want to go to a proper legit sanctuary and just see them for hours
where how title doesn t make sense years so separated at birth the circus had enough endangered elephants to give birth to two elephants and then sold them off
like two vietnam vets they went through some shit together
pachyderms display a level of working intelligence and strong family unit bonds that deserves the ‚Äúnon human person‚Äù legal status the indian government recently awarded to dolphins doing so greatly strengthened legal punishments for killing or harming them
i‚Äôve been looking for this for years where is the whole doc
the amount of emotion these big boyes show is astonishing
those giddy smiles on their faces such magnificent and intelligent creatures
zoos need to be destroyed idk how places like sea world are still open
‚Äúi have so much to tell you ‚Äù one of the elephants probably
we should not take animals from the wild to the circus at all because this is heartbreaking imagine not being together for years
we need to expand human rights by creating a designation of non human persons animals such as these along with any others that show this kind of complex emotion and intelligence should be born with inalienable rights its unspeakably evil how we re driving smart and loving animals into extinction but hey i guess we re doing it to ourselves too smh
to think that people hunt animals with this level of social and emotional abilities for fun
they look like they re reminiscing about old times while the walk so cute
i can‚Äôt stand how humanity treats animals we deserve extinction not them
i know elephants have excellent memories but how do they distinguish each other after so many years apart they all seem to look pretty much the same and i imagine they smell the same too
elephant a uses trunk for affectionate ear and face caress of long lost companion elephant b trunk straight between legs and doesn t budge power move elephant b power move
i wish i had a time machine to go back in time and kill pt barnum the ringling bros and the whole lot of them rotten bastards
i love animals so much ‚ù§Ô∏è just kindness in their hearts
this explains why cersei didn‚Äôt get them they were too busy
there‚Äôs no way someone can tell me other beings can‚Äôt feel or sense in their own ways dismissing other sentient beings is irresponsible and inhuman
elephants have been known to visit the graves of other elephants in a behaviour similar to mourning
this makes me sad and tearful but happy at the same time these beautiful intelligent gentle giants and the mistreatment they have received during their lives at the hands of man it s so heartwarming to see them together and thank you to the people who made it possible
this doesn t make me aww this makes me sad so fucking sad
that s it elephants are the shit and should be held to holy standards
ever think it s not about remembering eachother for the time they had but the time that brought two together
we as humans can be such assholes but we can also do the right thing eventually
i would say i m surprised they remember eachother after years but i guess elephants never forget
this isn t an aw moment this is an infuriating moment that these fucking circus people exploit these animals to make a profit entertaining children that don t know any better
the emotional complexity of elephants just amazes me
so sad but so heartwarming at the same time every elephant should be free and protected
i just dont get involved with anything that uses animals even zoos i know they do a lot of good but the majority dont so i just prefer not to give them money
that is so damn sweet i could watch this on relay all day long üò≠
elephants are some of the smartest most amazing animals look up how they re treated in captivity in most places that shit makes me pissed and sad on a level i didn t know i d feel for an animal basically they beat the elephants with clubs and control them with hooks and spiked chains they break there will and use them til they re too old or injured to make them money anymore saw a video of a tiger tied up with a chain with no room to move muzzled and declawed this shit sucks and people give the people who do this money to pet then etc and that s their life such majestic amazing animals tortured so much
three in the front and three in the back an old elephant joke from a weekly reader in the s
do zoos trade elephants i know they move other animals around but i hope they keep the herd together if they can
animals are inferior to humans only us can display emotions
oh man this broke my heart then healed it again elephants are beautiful
this is a very cruel world for so many animals love the elephants have a great time together
perfect example of animals have cpmplex emotions like we do
not gonna lie the left one looks like it‚Äôs sucking off the right one but still cute and adoring none the less
they re far too intelligent and emotional competent to be kept in a circus it s almost as if two humans are being reunited after almost a life of seperation what did we do to you we didn t have the right sorry this is making me cry
yes shirley and jenny my wife and i financially support the rescue organization in tennessee that takes these elephants in
i looked at the picture and thought awwww but then i realized it s reddit
didn t realize that circus in addition to enslaving them also removes their horns
it s always so fascinating to watch a child learn something

love this book so fun to read it and get the kids to recognize the different doggos and make all of the different doggo sounds big fan of sandra boynton books
less than a year old and still better than google image search
it s like you can actually see the gears turning in that child s head as she puts two and two together
okay i don t typically like baby videos but this is so pure
how many times do i have to see this before it becomes redundant
love how she elbows him to get his attention at first
having learned about how helen keller learned to communicate with the world and apparently it was water that kind of flicked the switch for her learning this is kinda how i always imagined it this is so wholesome aaaah
can someone loop the first jump into a jig and post a link here pls

i ve never understood why people wear shoes in their house
better than anything hollywood has put out for years
this is contrary to my personal experience the kids never want to die and use excuses like you missed or that didn t count who could forget the classic that s not fair
if not you can always make him real die to be more authentic

i used to live in south florida and one winter morning walking out to my truck i found one of these guys snoozing on my front porch the temp had dropped enough to where the lil guy had fallen into a semi coma type sleep bc of drastic drop in temp over night and he had fallen from one of our palm trees anyways i bring him inside to nurse him bc i‚Äôm an animal lover well this lil butthead awoke to me rubbing his belly and wasn‚Äôt so amused he latched onto my forearm with his mouth scaring the shit out of me and wouldn‚Äôt let go for a good ten mins sadly i had to ‚Äúwaterboard‚Äù him so he‚Äôd let go i couldn‚Äôt believe how strong he was felt like i was holding nothing but a strong muscle in my hands i was more than elated to release him back into my yard never saw him again but what a cool lil lizard cute lil guy there you got i‚Äôve actually always wanted to get one as a pet since my incident but almost scared to lol

my favorite part of going to mexico was what i called lizard bowling you d bowl a grape along a path and watch the iguanas chase after and fight to get it was beyond comical you re seeing a less full tilt version of it here but those massive iguanas holy shit they scramble also fun just giving them grapes as they stick them with their tongues careful if you run out of grapes try and feed them bad or something they can t stick they slice your finger up pretty good with their razor teeth and next thing you know you re in the hotel room scrubbing wounds with bar soap hoping you don t get any mexican lizard herpes

op cut the blueberry in half so he can taste it although they can eat it it is a bit difficult for them to break the skin
"üòÇüòÇüòÇ
remembers my kitten looking for butter seriously"
i don t know a huge amount about beardies diets outside of them needing some source of greens are blueberries good for them
i have never been a reptile person but this little guy is so damn cute i watched it twice aww
where can i get this vacuum cleaner it seems very efficient

and fruit doesn t taste like fruit anymore it has zero taste
man i am realizing how glad i am that these guys aren t really really big
i don‚Äôt know what it is with blueberries but my beardie is a big blueberry lover too basically the only thing he wants to eat besides worms
isn‚Äôt the same lizard as in that one meme where heavy metal music was played over it whenever he moved
the new sonic redesign‚Äôs looking better not gonna lie
the little floor slide up to one of the blueberries was cute
what a beautiful pup give him a hug and kiss for me

i love either human names or objects for cat names ie carol sharon lamp concrete
might want to sleep in the car with the doors locked for a while op
the overlord is angry you shall pay for your disrespect
what the game trailer looks like to what the game play looks like
i can t stop giggling over the look on the cat s face
hello and welcome to another exciting edition of im not havin it staring that cat
oh i just can t wait to be king so i can have you executed for treason
remember this moment human when there is a shit in the laundry this cat

cat is not amused also these new fancy hdtvs really bring out all the details in old disney movie tapes that simba looks so real
kitty sez yooo will die in yer sleeps hooman but not afore i barf in yur shooz
oh come on don‚Äôt give gold to a repost i‚Äôve seen this from like different people
your cat shows more emotion in its face than any of the characters in that film
defense attorney and that s why cuddly kitten became a murder mitten yer onor jury not guilty
pissed as shit at you for this bruh i swear to god you are no longer my wingman dude
this is one of the few reposts that amuses me whenever i see it
one is nala or simba amp x b one is a glorious cat of your household who knows your inner secrets tread kindly and wisely my dear poster
mr simba stunt double is not amused beware turds in your shoe
for some reason i get the sneaking suspicion that you re cat doesn t seem to be having fun
kelvin we have go over that already right this is the last warning

i will rain down fire and brimstone upon you and your kind with the full force of hellfire and fury of my ancestry foolish hooman so put me the fuck down amp x b what mr fluffykins amp x b meow mew mew meow
this is a repost please do something productive instead of stealing other redditors hard work
for real though reddit is actually crap now with all the reposts this was up like days ago
cat is annoyed at being reposted so much but i‚Äôll benevolently allow it
put treat not the best in front and put red mark on the head it will be more close
one of them is the indomitable king of the jungle the other is a lion cub
simba scared of the new world your cat bow down to me peasants
"left ‚Äúim scared please dont drop me‚Äú
right ‚Äúimma fuck you up as soon as you release me‚Äù"
wait people are watching it at home wasn t it just in theaters
simba is not as long as your cat does that mean big cats are not water
that cat is giving you the stare that it will murder your whole family in your sleep
ugh seeing the same picture beeing upvoted like that for the th time this month gets old
that look in the cat s eye is so sinister yet beautiful
it looks like they‚Äôre plotting your murder or something
the thumbnail looks like a supercat flying alongside an aeroplanes window this is the only reason i clicked
i swear i see this post once a week and it always gets to the front page somehow
he‚Äôs going to either murder you in your sleep or poop on your bed haha
that expression is gold if i had opposable thumbs they d never find your body hooman
when you reach for simba but accidentally grab scar
he s making that face because you re showing the wrong version of the film
if you haven t done this to your cat at least once do you even really have a cat
i never thought the end of the world would be so adorable
looks to me like the cat is putting the dog in its place
that s awesome do most dogs play with the cat i would ve thought a lot of them wouldn t be used to cats
do dogs know that a cat isn t a dog and do cats know dogs aren t cats
he is a mini schnauzer that has been a regular daycare pup since he was months old
awwwww one of my cats plays with pups like this the dogs are always super confused at first lol
i always meet a dog before accepting them as a daycare pup to be sure of their temperament the cat is only months old so he doesn‚Äôt know life outside of a constant rotation of new dogs he likes to walk among the dogs like a king
when we got utley the cat he was tiny we rubbed his fur in wet cat food and let our dog lick him clean he now believes he is our dogs puppy
my dog was a little scared of the kitten and the kitten was a little scared of his new home grooming or licking brings comfort to them both so i encouraged my dog to groom the kitten
our miniature schnauzer and one of our cats are only a couple of years apart and they used to play like this when she was young they don t do it as much just a little bit of burst of play inside but she does regularly hump him when she comes in from outside play
wow that s awesome your cat keeps the dogs busy so they don t miss home as much it s so sweet
i m not trying to scrutinize you or anything but at the end of the video the cat seemed upset from their body language tail wagging ears back and i can t tell too well but it almost looks like it s shackles were risen too i m making assumptions if i m wrong do please correct me in no way am i an expert i m but a paranoid person but are you completely sure it s just playing with the dog if that is the case it s just plain adorable
i also have a male black and silver miniature schnauzer years old and a female kitten months it is unbelievable fun
our fence is feet tall in the front yard the cat could leave at anytime but they played like that for over an hour utley just loves a good wrestling match
you are replying to your own thread and not other people s comments i m assuming you are on mobile and are clicking the wrong reply button
so cute my cat loves to play with the neighbors dogs
my spaniel use to play with my neighbors cat the same way thr cat s name was fido i sit on the stoop suck down s fee beers and watch them play good times thanks
wow this is truly the first cool cat that i ve ever seen the rest were all assholes or this one is at least asshole
wow my bonita mussolina would beat the shit out of any dog coming into our garden she goes dropbearcatstyle howling in a tree and jumping the borking enemy
that schnauzer has way more balls than my dimitri he goes in all playful but as soon as my cat even looks like he s going to retaliate he scarpers proper wuss
this dog looks exactly like my mum s he is playful when meeting other dogs but the only cat he has regularly met my sisters who lived with my mum for months his is petrified of tbh i think he is scared of his own reflection but wants to be everyones friend just super hurt from anyone who doesn t
you win you won the internet with this this is the coolest thing i have seen you won
you need to be careful my cat used to play with my dog like this and while playing he bit her a little and punctured her skin cat s skin is so thin i know it was in play but they probably got carried away too much i ended up taking my cat to the vet for stitching of the punctured hole
i saw the tail twitching at the end kitty s getting pissed lmao
cute schnauzer and your cat is pretty cool playing like with dogs
my dog wants to play with cats but he‚Äôs a kg ridgeback yeah look it‚Äôs not happening my love
my cat slaps my dog in the face and then rubs up against him when she s ready even i m confused by these mixed signals
be careful we lost our beloved cat due to our friend s dogs playing with him and their instincts kicked in and they attacked him cats aren t as bad ass as they think they are and can get overconfident thinking all dogs will play bite all the time
i have never seen a cat that energized with a dog before
but i want to know who ultimately wins the wholesome wrestling match
do you have to pay the vet bills if one of these dogs loses an eye to a wayward claw
i wonder if he thinks you re doing this for him everyday üòä
please post more of your cat playing with dogs because this is awesome never seen a cat play with a dog like that
so i was incidentally listening to kung fu fighting when i watched this but it turned out spectacular
i swear mini schnauzers are the best at getting along with cats even if they don t know them
hi your cat is attacking the dogs you claim to be carrying for good luck with your business
i could watch these videos for hourssssssss they are just so wholesome
it looks like your cat is wagging it s tail at the end
my theory is that when a dog has clothing a cat learns that he can use his claws on it without the dog screaming cats love to use their claws
i see you have purple bearded iris if you get in really closely and sniff them you ll find that they smell like grape kool aid there must be a purple fragrance
it s nice that the city embraces pride also rainbow crosswalks are awesome i need that in my life
i really like this and i think it‚Äôs beautiful however unfortunately it‚Äôs not very functional and it does not meet ada guidelines
i thought this was an old pacman gaming table from pizza hut as i scrolled by
very cool also long beach obviously has too much money on its hands
image how cute it would be if they put that money into actually helping members of the lgbtq community in long beach
my city did this too it ll look like ass in a week once it s all covered in tire marks and nobody bothers to clean it
i don‚Äôt have the documents in front of me right now but my municipality was attempting to do art crosswalks a couple years ago and we got shut down by the floor to government because crosswalks have to be an alternating pattern of high contrast they can be yellow and black they can be white and black but they have to be high contrast patterns and anything that isn‚Äôt doesn‚Äôt work we ended up getting away with doing piano keys
is that the dog equivalent of a duckface selfie fierce
what kind of dog is this i always forget how they are called
it s pretty cruel how humans have designed dogs would you like having that skull knowing someone was paid to make you that way or knowing you ll get heart disease or having your tail cut off with snips yay boxers what a great design
this sounds awful but i swear i don t mean it like that but she looks like one of those multi headed dragon things form hercules lol but she looks fantastic
thanks she is now the background of my pc starts my day with a smile
here i sit üê∂ in this human chair üí∫ relaxing basking ‚òÄÔ∏è getting some air üí® all of a sudden what do i see üò± that silly human taking pics of me üì∏
love the name she s gorgeous and i bet she s got a long list of things that taste better than skinny feels
this dog looks like wayne from letterkenny and that s what i appreciate about it
classic boxer elvis tooth i‚Äôve had in my life so far and all of them have done it
is anyone else getting a kangaroo feel or am i just high or something
classic boxer if she were brindle with white paws i would think this was my pup she looks like a fun and feisty companion
this looks like my babies only they don‚Äôt get along
i had to do a double take cuz i thought he was bleeding edit wait is he actually bleeding wtf
yeah but what‚Äôs that red blood like substance on him and don‚Äôt you dare say it‚Äôs just soup
god i thought you were a troll then i looked at ur profile and it really is only orange fur uff glad your cat is ok
i appreciate that everyone‚Äôs first reaction was ‚Äúis your cat okay ‚Äù
with everyone asking is your cat bleeding i just have to ask is your cat bleeding
animals love being close to the toilet because the porcelain stays cold my animals have always done it and it‚Äôs so cute
did a double take thinking he was bleeding realized it was orange opened comments to see if it was just me not just me
how to cause panic on reddit post a photo of a white cat with an orange spot in its inner leg
this made me smile i d love to have a cat like this walk up to me while at the grave of my grandma grandpa or highschool friend
heavy are those eyes he is providing a great moment of glee to families at their worst times
he has a very somber face he s given much comfort to many people good cat barney lt
by the look of those eyes he knows how to bring comfort to the grieving what a great kitty
barney the cat who spent his life hunting mice in a fun field full short grass and rocks and who liked getting pets but never understood why humans were always so sad
he probably guards the place from evil spirits i mean other evil spirits
i like to think that his human was once buried in that cemetery and barney just never left always close by supporting the others that came and went like his human‚Äôs family did once until finally being laid to rest next to his human forever
i hope they erect a stone to memorialize mans other best friend cats are incredibly perceptive i would be incredibly grateful if barney rubbed my leg or demanded pets while i was grieving all animals are a blessing but kitties will always have a special place in my heart
what a good floof he would have helped so many people
and now he guides those who‚Äôve died across the river styx for a simple fee of two anchovies
i had a few orange barney‚Äôs in my day the best cats
had a cemetary cat in water valley ms anytime my family would go to see my aunt the cat would sit in silence next to us and would offer comfort to anyone who needed it i don t believe in spiritual things or much in religion but there is something very special about cemetary cats
hey i ve seen a cat like this in my local graveyard probably not the same one though
this reminds me of something that happened a couple years ago basically i had a very good cat named happy he loved to play around but then sadly meet his end at the age of so when we buried him our cat jasmine who hates us walked up and started rolling around and playing she had never done that before and hasnt done anything close to it since its as if she knew what had happened and wanted to comfort us through the hard time
imagine being that cat and only knowing that area all the humans you come across are deeply saddened that cat must have just assumed humans are an incredibly sad species
his name should ve been barry or digger maybe plotz good boy
lived are you implying he‚Äôs not with us anymore maybe we all need another barney
he looks like he took his job very seriously good cat
a noble beast with a noble heart may he forever walk upon green fields
so happy to hear that they buried him in his favorite spot on the grounds
though all are lying in the ground and sloughed their mortal scales though all have walked that darkened path and through that misty veil they journeyed not in solitude they traveled with a friend and now i walk that path myself to meet with them again
when grandma sneaks you cake when your parents aren‚Äôt looking
poor thing is so overfed if it doesn t already suffer joint and hip pain it surely will soon
what‚Äôs sad is the double standards of fat cats being chonks and fat dogs are depressing allchonksmatter s
bear in mind huskies commonly develop lipomas fatty benign tumors later in life that being said this guy is just an absolute unit
don t make fun he s just a little husky doesthatjokegetusedeverytimesomeonepostsasmolhusky
grandma how the fuck did you have it gain like metric fuck tons in goddamn days
‚Äúmijo you‚Äôre skin and bones here have some more empanadas and some tamales‚Äù now i‚Äôm getting hungry üòã
i don t normally upvote on this subreddit but this kittie is too cute to not upvote
the first time you step on a lego and can not quite process the levels of pain that are manifesting
don t let the blep fool you that cat s about to start some shit

omg this is the most adorable bunnycat i have ever seen üòç
probably one of the cutest kitties i have ever seen
that blep is heckin adorable but there‚Äôs some crazy in those eyes this cat is about to go full psycho and dart around the house to the tune of destroy everything
aww this is the best photo i ve ever seen today such a cutie
this is also me when i see that the fridge is full of snacks
me when i realise i drove the dough to the school and put the kids in the oven
initially i thought you put googly eyes on your cats eyeballs happy you hadn t
i know i m not the only one who zoomed in to see the reflection
does no one else see creepy faces in those eyes google ‚Äòlord chaos marvel‚Äô is that just me ok
how d that beauty even end in a shelter to begin with we just had a siamese mix and same response how the fuck is this cat here he lasted days
cat realizes that you survived his latest attempt to kill you by tripping you at the top of cement stairs
look you can see your reflection really well in your cat‚Äôs eyes spookyüôÇ
those eyes have more definition than any tv i have ever seen üëÄüëÄ
that cat has either a seen some shit or b seeing shit
am i the only one who zoomed in on the eyes to see the reflection
my friend the tai has this cat and he is very mean to his jumin
i m sorry but i must steal this and use it to react to things
this cat sees dead people or just did a ton of acid
are they eyes like this because of the type or cat or can all cats do this never seen this
genuinely thought some horrid person put googly eyes on their cat
your cat has so much symmetry you go you handsome cat dude
i don t know man what if we re the pets and not the humans
zoomed in on the reflection in the eyes to see what the cat was looking at can‚Äôt quite make it out
this cat look like it knows everything but doesn t know how to tell them
funny that you had to clarify we own a red ‚Äúphx zoo‚Äù hat that my fianc√© is scared to wear because from far away a red hat is too sketch these days
anyone who gets butthurt over your shirt and not happy about the cat being absolutely adorable isn‚Äôt a true america at all
i have a red canada hat and i live in canada my cousin in toronto does not like it because she says it looks like a maga hat from afar are we gonna be that paranoid about clothes now i wish people would just chill
ain t it crazy that politics divides and brings so much hate that you have to clarify what your shirt says so people dont hate your cute kitty post that s bananas
very adorable also i have to disagree with your shirt as it implies americans ever read
what is wrong with a shirt that says make america great again
itt how dare you not want to associate yourself with well spoken and never controversial politician i m in love with
arnie voice i need your shirt your hair and your kitty cat
did you get it from strand book store i have a fridge magnet from there that says the same thing
lol people get so upset when you say things that directly correlate with bettering ourselves yes it‚Äôs a cute cat but don‚Äôt rant and get all butthurt haha
i wish their little tongues didn t rip our skin off then we could let then give us all the kisses
fluss pronounced floose it means river also in a different language also looks like a fluss just an idea
just an idea also i have the same pig haven‚Äôt given it to the pup yet too afraid she‚Äôll destroy it it‚Äôs so funny
having bad day today or something im here if you want to talk about it
your cat looks like an old fashioned hollywood superstar classy
is she made of cabernet i m so sorry for my terrible bordeaux joke
i live in alabama too can‚Äôt even watch the news now thanks for sharing margaux
i live in alabama too and my cat also makes it much bearable furry frands are the best
why do goldens always have such big litters my sister s dog had nine in her litter

doesn‚Äôt even need to offer me candy i‚Äôll get in that truck
goals a sierra denali and pups one day trav one day
unrelated question but i m getting a jack chi puppy sunday she s a couple months olds and i was wondering at what age do you introduce dogs to water if anyone could give me some advice that d be great

for a brief moment in time i really thought he was wearing a little jacket
sir squakington the rd appears to be quite pleased with his tribute artwork
somehow reminds me of the cube escape series i need some catching up to do
he should keep it in the attic and let it age while he remains youthful and breathtakingly beautiful

if it still had a tail that might have made it trickier
i was really expecting him to just blast through the walls like the kool aid man

please op buy a sadle for that little guy and put it on your doggo it s like a horse compared to him
wife and i have our first on the way my yr old dog has all of a sudden become endlessly energized and constantly craves attention like ‚Äúhey hey hey i‚Äôm still good look look watch i can run i can kick i can bork hey ‚Äù

your horse is about to eat your baby very cool congrats on the baby
repost i know because i commented about how irresponsible this is to allow the dog that close to the baby it s irresponsible to allow any animal near a baby regardless if they re your pet you re supervising or you re not doesn t matter you have no idea how an animal will react and it doesn t matter how close you are all it would take is a second
‚Äòa weird pupper to say the least but a cute one nevertheless ‚Äô
he looks like he wants to give him a pep talk but the little dood doesn‚Äôt listen
i love great danes they are gentle giants and so pretty

the dog s feet are the size of the baby s head i love the look on the dog s face pure love
you re very small and weak if anythin bigger than a squirrel wanted to hurt you you wouldn t stand much of a chance guess i ll have to protect you
i wonder if dogs regard our babies as cute the same way we regard their puppies as extra cute
hey u cuwake wendy bellissimo nice selection we loved ours and now my sil is using it too
so you re the new guy huh look like you wouldn t last a week without me of course
listen kid i ve been here a while and lemme tell you thing are gona be ruff
it s cool that you let your horse come inside to see the baby
id got rid of this dog you got a damn baby dont risk it big ass dog could easily kill it
every time i see this picture i can hear in my head what the dane is asking can you play now
dog are you sure he is safe in there i think i will satu here and make sure
i wish i knew exactly what the dog is thinking about the little creature in front of him
my daughter is only months amp i already wish she was this small again
so if i little dog like that is around a bunny all the time will it start to mimic mannerism and try to hop like a bunny
so which bunny expert will be telling me this rabbit is terrified and as a prey animal is scared of the dog
if we can invert this clip and show how the dog runs like the bunny it will be golden
its safe to say the evolution of that particular wolf went in favor of the rabbit
my bunny loved to jump around on the couch as well until my mum said he loses too much hair and is not allowed on the couch unless he s on someone s lap he always finted on jumping at my face and then in the last second jumped next to it on the backrest
doingdoingdoing boing doing doing doing doingdoingdoing boing doingdoingdoing boing
my god that rabbit can jump the dog looks more confused than anything
what is this thing it is so cute and potato but like a alien who is trying to look cute with those big eyes and i want to hug him and pet him and play with him but it looks like it can eat my whole arm
too cute in korean seals are called Î¨ºÍ∞ú which literally translates to water Î¨º dog Í∞ú it suits them
they way he had his head cocked in the thumbnail i thought i was about to see a cyclops baby seal
i was confused which one is the eyes and which one is the mouth lol
it looks like it ll take my soul if i look too long into it s eyes
small water dog spelling words like this only makes you sound like an year old
i thought its nose was an eye and its left eye was a mouth not aww but nightmare fuel then i realized my error
growing slowly extinct due to climate change and hoomans careless activity
the way it has its head tilted with those beady black eyes reminds me of the forest spirits in princess mononoke
that may be a sea lion more like a water cat or bear sea doggos seals don t use their front fins to stand they flop about to move on land
this is mega adorable but is it real or a doll the eyes are flat and lack shine which is throwing me off
it looks like it should be cute but those eyes and that head tilt are freaking me the fuck out it‚Äôs staring into my soul and not letting go major coraline vibes
this this is what i sub for not photos of people‚Äôs useless crotch fruit
yeah nah my brain just exploded due to an overload of cuteness
am i the only one that thinks this looks dead and stuffed
his eyes are straight out of those old little orphan annie cartoons
outta fur seal pups are born with blonde fur look at him go
i must consume his flesh hes obtained peak cuteness and must be devoured
holy shit is anyone else seeing fractals in the background im tripping this whole picture is psychedelic
i can feel the wetness of his nose through the screen
image credit lecorgi on instagram hotlink wasn t allowed
thank you üòä i knew those murders didn‚Äôt mean i was a terrible person
is that a phone booth in the back i was wondering where superman was getting changed
very lucky to have met marcel le corgi very good boi
dogs know who dog people are because dog people can t help but look at the dog with a smile and dogs see everything
this is what i wake up to every morning my malamute sticks his big wet nose in my face and sniffs until i respond if i don t respond soon enough he picks me up
given the tardis in the background in being on this being the eleventyfifth doctor come to say hello
thot it was a lion cub then i realized thats a nose
i know where this is i remember the blacksmith and toffeemaker closed down now may it rest in peace
that s the kinda snoot i would like to boop all day
got any drugs mate no pets will do fine instead thank you
motherfucker because of your title i am forced to upvote you here take it
i don t know for sure but that looks a bit like oxford
no no no keep on smellin good boy i am not what you looking for
wish i had dogs wonderful ability to sense who really loves em
i opened reddit to this does this mean i‚Äôm not a nice and or loveable person
nice pic of a dog that has turned away from the camera oh wait is it like that only for me
must be something wrong with his nose because i m an asshat
this is reddit right nah that little dog smells and detects assholes if we re gonna be honest
a corgi the telephone box britain a corgi has nose blooped your phone it is now a national landmark
i suspect regret is an emotion not felt much by hungry kitties
why does the kitten have what looks like yarn tied around its neck
it ll probably regret it when its human gives it a bath lol
hmmm perhaps that picture where the man is accused of dipping his cats face in yogurt is real after all
kitten is trying out her disguise as miniature yeti she has the white beard right
you‚Äôve got a little smudge on your chin buddy no on the other side
that s funny my cats are so demon possessed sometimes i wonder the same thing
cats i only see a black kitty but i want to give him all the pets üòç
yo what‚Äôs with the picture of the polar bear on the wall tho
they‚Äôre so cute they remind me of the cats luna and artemis from sailor moon
oh my gosh look at your dishes on the counter that match their little faces this is all just perfect
ahhhhhhhh so cute that poster in the background is awesome btw
no article of clothing is safe everything will show cat hair
my sympathies that your fabric articles will always show cat hair regardless of colour may their pure adorableness make up for it
this is legitimately how i feel every single day when i look at my cats how do you exist in this world you are perfection
my mom has these exact cats but the black one is named purrl and the white is peppurr
that‚Äôs why cats have to periodically stick their butts in your face or dig their claws into your leg to remind you that they‚Äôre real
so i see you cats keeps a dog s photo in their bathroom hahahah
what cats why did you post a picture of your counter
what are you talking about there aren‚Äôt any cats in this picture
what cats there are no cats in the pic just your wash basin
so these cats are immune to mirrors i wish i could go invisible like that
i ll go ahead and finish this for you op when they are not shredding the edge of your couch or carpet
if their names are not luna and artemis they should be changed to luna and artemis
i‚Äôm sorry to inform you that they are indeed not real but are actually night furies please report to your nearest dragon training facility
there here to speak to you about the dog art on the bathroom wall
no one gonna notice the awesome doggo and donkey in the background picture
that little white patch on the nose of the black kitty holy crap cuteness overload
why do they look like it‚Äôs an intervention they are just looking like john we need to talk about the drinking
i cannot unsee the black cats mark nose as its mouth
that s because they aren t real we re just a simulation on a computer
yea don t worry our extradimensional overlords accidentally overtuned the cuteness on your cat simulations it ll be back to normal in a few years give or take
there is something so incredible about having a black cat and also a white cat i have one of each myself and they amaze me with their contrast and cuteness every day üòçüòçüòçüòç your cats really are so cute they don‚Äôt seem real lmao
they are wondering why you have a dog painting on your walls
so cute the way cats noses and mouths are shaped always looks like they re frowning
my cat watchs me shower every morning its a thing now
there are no cats i think you are having some delusions
did she seem like she liked the sled why was she leader how much like a house dog was or wasn‚Äôt she
that s a great photo super jealous of your adventure
that‚Äôs so cool riding in a dogsled is definitely on my bucket list
i love this post ‚Äôwent to the north pole meh but check out this dog ‚Äô she‚Äôs beautiful
in my experience working sled dogs in remote areas are about as affectionate and treated about as affectionately as you would expect your car to be tourist operations are likely different
what type of expedition was this did you fly to the central arctic please post more pictures of the dogs and journey
was this the actual north pole or were you guiding worked in the arctic circle companies tend to have a habit of over stating and exaggerating where they actually are cos it sounds neat lol
yes winter is coming she‚Äôs only slow because she‚Äôs pulling a sled
did it like to be petted or was that not worth the risk to your arm
i am vinter i pull de sled i piss on anything i please
she looks like a border collie is she if so does she have the strength of a husky malamute etc is her coat thick enough for warmth when she‚Äôs not working
look i appreciate the attention but i got a job to do
she s so beautiful i wonder how long it took to train her for lead sled dog want to take my dog mushing she d love it but is to energetic and probably end up driving me into a ditch or something
beautiful what breed is she she kinda looks like a karelian bear dog
i remember reading jack london s books as a kid is it true that sled dogs will murder each other for predominance in the sled pack
her eyes look intense agressive and sweet all at the same time
why not just drive there it s far more pleasent and you can drink
judging from her eyes i d say she has a serious crush for you
she reminds me of the dog from snow dogs who ended up as a lead as well
such a deep look content please stop looking at my soul
she looks so sweet now but looks like she takes her job very seriously i can see her barking orders keeping the other dogs in line and being a tough dog
would kiss that muzzle until there was nothing left
is that carelian bear dog i have cbd for hunting and its just looks like your dog
awee what a beautiful girl those deep eyes lt so precious
same here i‚Äôm sure the owner was a real animal lover poor guy had no idea the shit show he invited into his house
i have a rescue akita kbd and this looks just like a younger version of my boy he s much more salt and pepper these days best dog ever
my indian dad pronounces winter as vinter he also calls my dog rojee her name is rosie she likes rojiee more
she ll be dead in a few years they don t care about them
if the dogs can pet the dogs then we are now useless the endtimes have come
how do people capture shit like this i have dogs and all they do is be dumb
repost from this sub from a week ago you are pathetic
the dog just had a realization now i understand why humans do it this is very nice
every time i pet a dog i feel a love inside from me from them we share it it just cannot be denied their eager happy faces when they feel a human hand the wordless look of gratitude that we both understand i am dog hello my friend i feel your human touch just met you but i love you n appreciate you much if dogs can make us feel that way just like a loving brother why can t we do that too n just be nice to one another
more evidence that retrievers are humans in dog costumes
even though i have seen this gif for like million times now i upvote every time
omg that is soo adorable exactly like a little kid after being taught how to treat a newborn even the smile look for approval
oh dont mind me i just saw this upload was at comments and wanted it to be better amp x b nice post btw
welp where screw now with dogs knowing how to pet each other time to stock up on dog biscuits
in dog logic this translates as please do this thing to me
dogs can pet other dogs a new world has opened for us
if you guys want more these dogs have an ig account their handle is aarun evolution they live in japan and make frequent posts and stories would recommend
grass grows birds fly sun shines and brother this gif gets reposted everyday
hm let me try what my hoomans do oh i totally get it now
me too man i love that when i pet a dog o get happy
the dog lying seems so sad that even another dog is trying to console him
i had kind of shitty day and this genuinely fixed it more than the beer i m drinking
no matter how many times this is reposted i enjoy it
i love this gif but hawt damn is this reposted every hour
this dog has clearly been trained to do this he does the motion then looks to the person with the camera for approval i mean it s still adorable but it s obviously staged
no matter how many times i see this video i will always stop to watch so i can awww
i think i can with satisfying certainty say that this is my favorite clip on the entire internet thank you dog bless
jesus christ how many times does this need to be reposted with the same title nonetheless
eli is the dog actually smiling or is it just how their mouths look when they open them
i ve seen this so many times but i love this gif it doesn t get old
this gets posted almost weekly but people get away with it because it s dogs just being cute
new post title suggestion ‚Äúhow i feel reposting old memes for karma‚Äù
let me check temperature amp x b nope faker you re going to school
this is the only gif i approve to get posted once a week
last time i tried i got bit probably not a good idea to pet the fire dpt doggo without asking first apparently he‚Äôs old and grumpy so now i‚Äôll have a black nail for a few months as a reminder to not be an idiot d
this makes me think do dogs actually smile or is it just an involuntary thing like when a baby passes gas they smile
itt a dog pets its enemy as it is dying because he poisoned it and is smiling mocking it the game of canines
it s like he said how come people get so happy when they pet me let s me try this myself
everytime my repost goes unbanned and make i lots of internet point
he s smiling because he realized he can be free now and get the all rubs
if someone reposting means i get to see this again i m fine with it
mom said it was my turn to repost this since last week s repost
i like awww but sometimes im not sure if the pictures a genuinely capture in the moment are the pets just watching their owners with a smartphone in their hand of the times
feel better soon lil man hope you have a quick and fast recovery üíï
i hope your son has a wonderful and speedy recovery wishes for your family
oh he s just the sweetest i hope he has a speedy recovery
do you have a map because i m lost in at sea in your eyes
so its your eyes that have been showing up in my dreams
why is this not on the cover of national geographic
wow it s a match made in heaven that s why the eyes are sky blue
scary you guys must be really weird if you find this cute
really highlights the differences between human and dog eyes great picture
i think it s cute because you try an attempt to get a like for your eyes but everybody prefers the dog s eyes lol
maybe it ll run around your living room and tear shit up afterwards fucking huskies
must be photoshopped husky won‚Äôt ever be this still lol
aye beware of arya she has a thing for killing beings with blue eyes
i m imagining that these both belong to the same creature and what it would look like
an i the only one that can see the lines going thru here eyes as if it was post
humans are somewhat low downn the good looking scale human babies are scrunchy things akin to baby parrots i can picture aliens landing and admiring a pack of wolves or a beaver family then a human shows up and what is that god awful looking thing
does every picture have to be photoshopped so hard to find a genuine picture of people and animals ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
siberianhusky jax on instagram his other eye is brown
i can t stop seeing a butt with eyes and one furry cheek
i feel like everyone is low key bashing the chick all the ‚Äúup vote for the dog‚Äù comments not a complaint just an observation
dog eyes are black holes in space leading to multiple dimensions of lovable crazy the eye on the right beautiful as it is i ain t gonna venture a guess as to what s behind that
i could care less for the human in the picture but the puppy has beautiful eyes
that man has a half furry face and no nose quick we must raise money to help with this condition
is this real idk but i have eyes like that person blue with yellow specks
so what is this a suggestion women are dogs outrageous and inappropriate post
come sit with me awhile out here n tell me bout your day am dog am loyal love you near don t always have to play it s nice here on this swinging chair the porch my favrit place why don t we sit out there i love the sun upon my face n as i hear your voice i know these memories you ll keep the day you watched me real s l o w just drifting off to sleep
if this isn t how my retirement looks i ll be disappointed
makes me want to go sit out on my porch with my pooch and just enjoy the scenery and companionship
i wish i felt the sense of calm this doggo is experiencing sweet dreams
my lab literally does the same thing after swimming in the pool jumps up on the swing and rocks himself to sleep
i don‚Äôt know why but this made me a little emotional and teary i just instantly love this pup so much
question how do people who own golden retrievers ever manage to stop petting them long enough to go to work or take a video
hold a doggy treat under his nose and instant wake up
the little bit of movement of his head towards the end tells me he is trying to chase rabbits but his leg won‚Äôt kick in the position he is in
my heart skipped a beat i can t this is not good for my rage
this is why i want a porch swing my black lab would do this too
that s a happy cute pooch kudos to you my baby boy gets spoilt more than me too
i m gonna have to put a request here for a perfectly looped version of this
golden retrievers are just the ultimate feel good doggos
why don‚Äôt people who make lo fi hip hop music to study relax to use gifs like this
this brings up a question why is it so easy to wake up a dog they re like the lightest sleepers ever
this is the cutest thing i‚Äôve seen in a while i genuinely can not wait to get a dog but i know i can‚Äôt afford to keep one happy and healthy which breaks my heart
that is probably the kindest prettiest cutest faces i have ever seen on a pupper what a beauty
his nose is soooo close but i can‚Äôt seem to kiss it üò©
can i just say how posts with dogs in them are the most wholesome thing ever i mean you never find a troll in the comment section dogs really bring out the best in us
used to have a very rare pupper named lucy who loved sitting in the swing with her pop she was the goodest girl she would climb a ladder to get where you were for lovins literally had to be carried down which was quite the accomplishment on my dad s part for she was about lb pitbull mix rest in paradise lucy will forever miss you
imagine being this relaxed amp x b also i want to boop that snoot
i‚Äôm happy that the dog is comfortable and looks peaceful
u amountainbound hmmm kinda reminds me of a certain someone üòâ
my cat tries to disembowl my hand with his back feet whenever i go too close to his belly
mine does this too but he bites and claws up my hands because he‚Äôs a little jerk
adorable my boy loves his belly rubbed too longest time we ve had so far was with my so for almost an hour while we were watching a movie üòç
that s the only reason humans got fingers in evolution to serve the masters
helping your little furry out by rubbing him one out
just a few paw steps out of the womb and already running things
the accent sounds caribbean but the skin looks european
if you need a break i ll gladly take over ü•∞ such a cutie ‚ô•Ô∏è
my cat tries to claw me when i try this is my cat broken
every day when i come home from work my cat flops over in the living room and assumes belly rub position the payment for me going to work to pay for his food must be paid if it is not paid immediately because i don t know i have hands full of groceries or need to use the restroom he will follow me around the house whining at me and randomly flopping over until belly rubs have been administered
am kit woah woah get back here fren i want them belly rubs again the way you rub bottom to top don t let them belly rubbings stop you must learn serve is what you re for so if i want you give me more them rubs so good they lots of fun i ll tell you human when you re done
this is how they lure you in make you complacent kitty will submit for tummy rubs and then one day kitty will flay skin from palm expose your neat little wrist bones and chew the end off your thumb
it would be so awesome if there was a giant hand almost the size of your body giving you a massage
just want to point out you didn t once touch its belly that is its chest
yeah my cat‚Äôs belly is definitely the kill zone ops cat is a sweetheart
very cute but i actually had a silly question what kind of camera was this video taken with it looks like they live right inside my ipad
if i ever tried to rub my cat‚Äôs belly like that it‚Äôd be the last thing i ever tried to do
that is true love right their cats don t like people touching there stomachs because its there weakest point and they want to protect it this proves this cat loves you so much she is willing to put her life in your hands
my sister s cat will reach out and tap your arm when you walk by her if she is on the back of the couch and wants attention
my cat does the same but also pushes my hand away with her feet whilst trying to pull my hand in to give belly rubs
gt allow yourself a minute to appreciate its cuteness allow yourself a minute to tremble at its ferocity ftfy
i can t wait for the day science gives us miniature elephants
lol one minute fake charging at the car then plop cannot walk hey look a stiik x d
i thought this was fake then i realized it s been twenty years plus since the commercialisation of cameras
would have been funny if the last scene she was using a bottle of glue
now show the idea of the girl running like a horse her final evolution
imma get donwoted a lot but do you know what would not be funny the horse biting her finger off or kicking her no that would not be funny because these things happen even if you trust a horse and he is used to it he still can get startled but then it s gonna be all why my baby etc well because parents are fucking stupid that is why
why do people risk their children s fingers lol jesus christ even the nicest of animals are unpredictable if they get pinched too hard for their liking
mader me cry too honestly there is just something so pure about seeing someone grow up into a caring loving beautiful little person and you know they are because you saw the gentle times and horses don t put up with crap just for movies they love her she loves them something to be said for children raised around animals that s what i think
this is one of the most heartwarming clips i have seen please vote for this clip
you left out the video of the horse attending her wedding and visiting her in her hospital bed then attending her funeral
except animals can be unpredictable this is terrible irresponsible
it makes me want to cry at the thought of the horse potentially biting her entire hand off if she accidentally pinches in the wrong way or crushing her with a response it s not likely to happen but even adults have to be careful with horses due to how dangerous they can be i would never put a child around one that couldn t tell me the warning signs to look for to tell when the horse is getting spooked
shitty parent amp x b a horse can very quickly and unexpectedly become startled by anything and kill that child
someone should put some hardcore metal in tbis video and see if it will have the same effect
things humans are surprisingly useless until they are like she looks waaay to good at to be the girl with the horses
after seeing that horse eat a chick this makes me uncomfortable
cute video no way that s the same girl video quality is consistent throughout go check a youtube video from years ago looks nothing like this being rich must be nice
when it says years old that complete b s kid is and a half at the oldest what a weird lie to bother telling oh and the music is so obnoxious
it makes you sad because thats how we are supposed to live in harmony
that i understand but based on just the video she does not seem to be developmentally disabled just going on my personal experience as a mom if im wrong then i apologize
uh these aren t the same people and that was definitely not a year old
beautiful if you‚Äôve never spent time with a horse try it they‚Äôre wonderful creatures with personalities just like us i‚Äôve seen lots like this vid it‚Äôs notnunconnon
i too went from adorable to attractive it is nice when things go as planned
ignoring the fact this isn t the same girl that baby nearly lost it s fingers etc can we talk about that blissed out horse getting its ears rubbed i ve never seen an expression like that on a horse before and i kind of love it
i never knew horses were so gentle with children they have to be the most majestic creatures in existence
panic attack there‚Äôs so many things that could have gone wrong with the horses to hurt the kid maybe i‚Äôve seen too many horse accidents in my day
that horse totally blissed out at the end was like asmr also that walk at age is actually really funny
unwise somebody loved me as much as that girl loves horses
i didn t i said if she was i could see the need for diapers at
absolutely heartwarming on a multitude of levels look like some very lucky horses
warning horses bite they have flat teeth but they have teeth and a powerful bite behind it
this video is agitating irresponsible parenting false captioning passing off multiple kids as one and emotionally manipulating music so cringey it brings me actual physical discomfort ew
the fact that the horses are so gentle with her when she‚Äôs little as well ‚Äô
this is adorable but that year old is arguably and the year old is arguably
those ear scratches at the end that horse is loooooving it
i m irrationally worried that the horse is going to try to eat the child
man what camera did they use i want one with a battery that lasts that long
man that horse spent years waiting to have its ears scratched edit hnnnggggg
this is one of the keystones behind equin therapy horses simply know emotion and can reflect that feeling it‚Äôs a happy baby therefore a happy horse
it s cool that the same choir and band came back each year for the background
i don‚Äôt know much about horses but i‚Äôd be scared of my kid getting her face bitten off
those are some strange dogs but hey i like the story tellin
i read on another post that horses can‚Äôt really see in front of them bc they don‚Äôt need to stare at grass that doesn‚Äôt move when they could be watching their sides for predators what if this horse can‚Äôt see the kid and decides to take a bite of some baby grass
aw i miss riding it s super sweet but man i d be worried about a toddlers fingers and a horses mouth i almost lost a thumb nail to a horse when i was but it s not my kid so whatever
they know man animals are much smarter than we give them credit for
even if it s separate girls i m more suprised of that massive time jump
this literally made me feel better about humanity in minutes thank you for posting
i kinda have this then with all animals pretty much every animal is chill with me i think im a capibara
i love all the city people who watch youtube videos of horses gone wild and then cry in the comments about how dangerous this horse could be obviously since animals all have personalities and habits they can be dangerous but many aren t especially well trained horses they re very aware of what they re doing even when spooked they re as likely to accidentally bite her hand off or crush her as you are hell you re probably a lot clumsier and easier to spook
it s the music try replacing the track with some benny hill
das hawt das hawt fbi open up i meant at bro fbi retreat
i don t like that nope i ve seen good horses bite people with no provocation would never let any child near a horse take them little finger right off tell ye wut
it makes you want to cry because of the music for the record audio affects human emotion more than visuals do in most cases
makes us wanna cry because few of us can afford to own much less shower affection on a barn full of horses it s relatively easy to put sad music to a bunch of videos portraying what only the wealthy can enjoy cute but it s nicer to see the spontaneous awww
i love when she‚Äôs running through the stable like hiii everyone i‚Äôm here time for pats and kisses
imagine all the children who were killed by abortion too bad they never got a chance at life
holy shit i would never in a million years do this i ve been around horses for decades and i would never trust my kid s life like this horses are prey animals and they do unpredictable things no matter how well you know them
reels em in like nothing else well done fisherman ü§£
they dont discriminate either you d get same reaction from big manly men at a hardware store
girls aawwwwwwwww lt dog yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeessss owner i mheretoo
my roommate had those teddy bear dogs if i didn t already have a gf that dog would have easily gotten me a few phone numbers
dude filming is jealous cause none of them fussing over him
have corgis constantly get stopped for pets and scritches they are chick magnets
plot twist the owner of the dog is the wingman pups gettin all the attention
as the owner of an incredibly cute puppy my favorite is when a ridiculously attracting human stop my dog pet her ask her questions that i have to answer then carry on their way without ever making any acknowledgement of my presence
okay my cousin and his friends used my family dog and me when i was a baby to pick up chicks it always worked
the only thing that beats this is what my college roommate and i would do we would go down the the ut campus amphitheater we were students at the time i would take my guitar and he would take his pet rabbit on a leash they heard me looked and saw a pure white fluffy ass bunny hopping around next to the guys playing guitar i swear to god it worked every time
i used to walk my friend‚Äôs dog to help him out with work now i still do it because i get phone numbers like of the time
i had a little white rabbit and bought him a leash and harness would take him about and it was the same way girls and guys loved him he used to lick my ears alot and was a sweet little rabbit
want to pick up the entire girls lacrosse team get a golden puppy
i had to double take after i thought the leash was a piss stream
once after primary school we were waiting for high school to come out schools were connected and while we were waiting for my older sibling to leave my mom brought our mini dachshund about months old to school and the girls went mad with affection over the little pup
this totally works the other way around too i would take my puppy with me on walks around my campus big name well known university once we walked by the football practice field when the team happened to be leaving i can t tell you how funny it was to see all this huge macho guys get on the ground and coo at a puppy while i m standing there at laughing my ass off tbf she is the cutest dog ever
not one person looked at the other end of the leash
when i was single my dog was the best wingman he brought them in and i got to do all the talking i could post up at the beach and get approached all day long
is it possible to overdose from being petted asking for a friend
reminded me of a scene from the walking dead if they would take notes maybe i d start watching it again
how do i use this information to meet girls they keep touching the dog and not me
hate to break it to you but you are the dogs wingman
i can almost hear this vid but then almost not again cause it could be thousands of different sounds
man that one girl with the short short ugh i bet her musk is intoxicating i would love to stick my face between those cheeks even if she was sweaty
this was the master plan of the golden all along this is a test run now he she will walk around everywhere taking control of everyone who pets him her mount a defense you shall not pass
ah yes the old kitty clavicle my grandfather suffered from that
anytime i get the shouldercats i also get the catbackswipes too
awww what a sweetie definitely a reason not to go into work ‚ù§Ô∏è
sounds serious you should take the rest of the week off
i love how overjoyed the guy is to be blessed with such a fine scarf
the real boss has been all over his back the whole morning
kitty looks so content lying on the shoulder of a young mandy patinkin
‚Äúsorry buddy but that is no reason not to come into work you‚Äôll have to come in with your shouldercats and just get on with it ‚Äù whilst i take a turn with shouldercat
now that is pure joy i hope she has a great birthday
my absolute favorite thing on fb are the pictures of people that just adopted cats posted by my local animal shelter the smiles of people are so genuine when they have their new cat in their arms for the first time
what a mathematically perfect line of teeth won t need braces like me
they should use her photo in the packaging of kinder chocolates
careful next she ll want three dragons it won t go well from there
my sister and i adopted our first kittens at about her age i‚Äôm actually tearing up remembering those kitties who we instantly bonded with grew up with and were best friends with all the math homework frustration defused by a cat swatting at a moving pencil the dumb middle school emotional meltdowns comforted by a purring cat crawling into my lap my cat insisting he get tucked into the blankets with me every night that cat brought me so much joy and taught me so much about responsibility empathy and wholehearted love i hope your daughter‚Äôs kitty makes her happy moments happier and is a shining light in her dark moments
looks to me like you are already at a humane society if i walk in the door the adoption decision has already been made it s like when your wife says we should look at houses it really means you are buying a house
you get to adopt a kitty hold it hold it don t move a muscle hold this kitty click
that smile puts sunshine in my day how could it not plus there is a tiny kitty
i don t even like kids all that much and this pic made me tear up a bit great pic
that kitten has no idea how much love is about to be given to it
you‚Äôve just made her day no her year no her whole life
these kinds of moments are what make parenting so rewarding üòª
her shirt makes it look like you had to do this out of guilt for forcing her to do child labour at your family pizzeria
she had to look at your camera instead of your face
i‚Äòd adopt her too you could keep the kitten if you want
oh this is so sweet what an amazing gift has she ever had any pets before the first time is always so exciting for kids also off topic but i don‚Äôt think i‚Äôve ever seen a child with such beautiful and straight teeth my years of braces and jaw surgeries are flashing back to me
for some reason her expression reminds me of the crazy girlfriend meme
they all want a cat but they don‚Äôt want to clean the litter box
gt the look on my daughter s face when i tell her to pose for a picture so dad can get the sweet karma ftfy
the look of joy on a child s face is one of the best things in the world
how do you manage to take pictures like those did you tell her to hold on to that reaction till you re done taking a picture of her
that is pure delight you get bonus points every time you make a child smile like that nicely done
now post her face when you tell her she gets to clean the litter box once per week
so sweet i lost my kitty about years ago i had him since i was probably your daughter s age he loved being held like a baby where you have his belly against your arm and his paws are on your shoulder perfect snuggle spot access he also loved licking the dripping water from the tub faucet
the perspective makes her look kinda like angela from the office while also making her body look younger than it is great move though op kittens are awesome
my girls and each adopted their own kitten last year they love those little guys more than they love me or mom it s awesome for children to have pets at this age teaches them compassion and responsibility
i love kids at this age they can not hide their emotions that s joy all over her face
aww i was just like her when i was a kid my biggest gifts were my parents allowing me to adopt pets lol
parents getting kittens puppies for really young children that always ends well s
aw she looks so happy there‚Äôs something so precious and innocent about the happiness of a child i hate that i‚Äôm so cynical these days but posts like these help bring me back to simpler times congratulations
from the looks of it she will own of her own dragons too
that‚Äôs sweet but make sure she understands a kitten is a life long commitment and not just a birthday gift that she‚Äôll forget next year
i m not meaning this to be nasty or anything but if your kid mtf
animals for presents is always a bad precedent whether it is christmas or birthdays the point of owning an animal should focus on how responsible the person is not what day of the year it is i would recommend a video game where the kid must take care of the electronic animal every day so they can understand the responsibility involved in caring for them they used to use tamagotchi back in the day but they also have ds games with the same concept
priceless seeing joy on a child s face is one of the greatest blessings of having children
it s fucking weird that in this moment she doesn t look at her mothers eyes but the camera
hold the kitten like a baby if they let you and are calm that s a good sign they are a great cat at least that s what i ve heard and from getting my own kitty years ago i can say it s true however that was just one cat
aww bffs i was about that age when my parents got my younger brother amp i a puppy it was my job to feed amp water him and take him on walks he was so much fun to be with that it didn t seem like work to care for him just joy
so sweet we adopted our kitty baby when my son was and my daughter was i told them the news when we were in the car on the way to pick her up my son said i feel like i m going to cry today is that kitty s th birthday and the boy is now
we foster kittens for a local humane society it always makes me happy to think they will be going off to loving families
this is my goal for whenever i get lucky enough to finally have children with my husband we have a dog and cats already but it just means alot knowing that i can give my child something as big as this for their own one day
see this is why i hate going to petsmart the kitties are just watching me i already have dog and cat rescues but the adopt a cats make me feel guilty every single time
half way home animal rescue i volunteer to help clean those cat cages lol
so sweet looks to be a little tabby just like my childhood cat that cat was the sweetest part of my life for years and gave me such a passion for cats i now have a sweet black cat and i want to bring in some foster cats for her to help socialize i want to help as many of them as i can
wow just imagine how happy she ll be when you let her get a dog
buying your year a pet as a gift is the dumbest thing i have ever heard of this kid is so young she probably can t do basic things yet i dont mean that in a derogatory way its just that she is so young why get her a pet
you are all mostly so kind thank you for the gold silver
adopt no no no need to get the k bengal ffs come on s
i don t know what s cuter the cat or your daughter s face
so cool to see this we re fostering kittens and they are old enough as of this weekend to go meet n greet for adoptions look forward to seeing someone smile and light up like this when they pick one of our nuggets
okay i have a question anyone know what s a good breed of dog or cat that s good for someone like me that s extreamly allergic to both cats and dogs dander or should i just deal without having a dog or cat if that makes sence
pets as gifts are always a poor decision pets are not gifts gt
wish my dad got this for me my sister and i have been begging for a cat for months and our birthdays are only a day apart
if she were years older she‚Äôd look just like my history professor
i looked just like that when my husband took me to adopt my baby on my birthday may your daughter and her kitty make many memories together
lovely picture do consider a second kitty to be a friend to the first it is such fun to watch them play together and they re company to each other when the family travels or daughter has soccer practice etc it really is not much more work at all to have two
you know on their own i don t like kids but what i do love is seeing anyone get so excited over the prospect of adopting a needy little kitty i wish your daughter many happy years with that adorable furball
i m so excited for her thank you for sharing this picture it reminded me of when i got my tuxedo i had a hard day at work and came home to a meowing kitten who needed to grow into his fur years later he s a growing boy with a bow tie amp x b edit words added
no offence but she looks like a boy i have no problems with that i m just sayin but still very wholesome
i was when my parents told me this and my face was exactly the same she‚Äôll have many happy years with her little fur ball
you have a lovely little girl that smile could light up a room
you best give that little girl a kitten judging by the look on her fave she d be heartbroken otherwise
parents live for looks like that from their children
hahaha this is crazy hey dude i used to live with you in your spare room while i was in nursing school don‚Äôt want to give away any names because reddit tell your wife i said hi and i love her
beautifully said i hope this little girl has the same wonderful experience with her kitten as you did
as someone who volunteer at a cat shelter that smile is why we work so hard to see someone find their new friend is one of the best feeling in the world i wish them many wonderful years together
just before my daughter s th birthday i was angry over something and my wife remarked that i was going to give birth to kittens my daughter misheard it and thought she was getting a birthday kitten that cat is now years old
follow up when she gets to clean the messes up source had a cat that loved pooping in the bathroom sink
did she pick the one she was holding it s cute my daughter always picked the ugliest kitten in the bunch by always i mean twice plus the thousand times she begged to adopt another one two is my limit
that s the kind of dad i want to be not just the cat but the smile goals
it s like the definition of eyes lighting up this is a good thing
its more fun to look at that face without a phone in between this is not a judgement but things like these are to be kept for yourself i think
dachshunds are the number one biters at my job so the sign isn‚Äôt wrong exactly
might not look like it but those dogs are biting machines they might look silly with their little legs but they still have very strong bite
weens are like targaryens you flip a coin and get a sweet oaf or one with small dog syndrome
dachshunds are vicious little shits i have one and i‚Äôve seen him chase off a pit bull that was charging me and our other dog this is what happens when you breed a dog to be stubborn and hunt badgers
they‚Äôre meant to fight badgers they can be very aggressive and mean but i love them
my dauchshund gave no shits about the size of whatever he wanted a piece of the giant lb bulldog down the street bring it on the neighbors great dane it s just that much more of a climb to his face the only animals he didn t want to fight were kittens puppies and babies and members of his pack
he is just the distraction while you are lost in his sweet eyes a huge dog comes from the right and bite the half of you
for some reason i thought it was a duck still wish it was a duck
that doggo needs his nails trimmed very cute though
dachshunds are assholes they bite without warning for the smallest reasons i don t understand how anyone can get past that
believe it or not they are well known to bite just not aggressively go out of their way to bite you nor cause bites that lead to hospital visits
i would stop any crimes i‚Äôm committing based off that smile
my dachshund mix and our other black lab mix will break up fights between my cats as soon as they hear them fighting they will run over there barking and get in between them
was bitten twice in my life both times a wiener dog both times unprovoked those guys are mental
my two tiny pups look adorable but are actually more like lawn piranha don t let their sweet faces and tiny size confuse you you can run but they latch onto nuts as quickly as ankles
i fucking despise dachshunds one of the few living things i truly hate they are ugly pathetic shit mongers who don t know their place i ve never seen any other breed of dog actually growl unprovoked at the people who feed love and take care of it fuck them i m pretty sure chihuahuas do the same but i ve never encountered one
but he looks like he definitely wants to let you in
doxies can be vicious tbf they may look cute and cuddly but they were bred to be vicious badger hunters and don t take shit from no one
psa beware of dog signs can be used against you in a lawsuit putting up a joking sign if your dog is a sweetheart is still a bad idea if somebody ever does get hurt by your dog even if they initiated it somehow they can try and claim you knew your dog was viscious and aggressive and failed to secure it ie you were out on a walk and it got loose or it escaped the yard and bit a person hurt another animal i wouldn t do it some states have absolute liability for dogs anyways meaning you re always responsible for your dog and it doesn t matter if the dog has a history or not depending on state law you may be admitting to harboring a dangerous animal and you now admitted every visitor is in danger from your dog a better bet is a no trespassing sign so it s posted that nobody can enter the property and you re warning them off without a sign that your dog is dangerous check state and local laws it can backfire and put your pup in a bad spot even if he was provoked by a trespasser
most of the time people put these signs up to protect themselves from liability in some municipalities if your dog injures someone even if they are trespassing you are liable for it unless you have a clearly posted beware of dog sign hell where i live you even have to have one in your backyard
ya these dogs are assholes i ve never met one that wasn t annoying and or incredibly aggressive
we had one that was raised with a big yard up against trees couldnt see neighbors he was proof that this breed is a hunting breed would bring back rabbits chipmunks the occasional squirrel far more critters than our lab ever was interested to hunt fiercely territorial and highly protective of their owners they re not afraid to bite if provoked you have to be very diligent training them and acclimating them to people early one ours wasnt and had a hard time adjusting to city life eventually he loved walks and was always nice on the walk just not when somebody was at our door he would also always devour our mail as it came through the slot grabbing it from the mailman who encouraged it and shaking it to pieces our mail would have blood on it from time to time he went so batshit crazy vicious on it once he was so old and mostly blind he could hear the flap and the mailman would wiggle the mail around to help him find it totally ok with the mailman though if ever he met him out in the front yard he just thought mail needed to fucking die
i m picture some waspy middle aged calling police about a cookout neighbor demanding they put up a sign for this hellion or beast or some such adjective
i kept waiting for his doberman big brother to show up
thats the face of a beast with no fear not even the bravest of soldier will stare it down but you you are the chosen one
this looks like one of those st date moments where you met a girl from a dating site and she says your profile looks very differnent
holy frick those eyes also dont mess with german dogs they are fluent in million styles of kicking your butt
we laugh but we also have these tendons in the back of our legs and feet and they are named for achilles that dog isn t being cute he s waiting for his moment to shine
this breed doesn t fear anything anyone breed with most guts
those little dogs are the biggest assholes i honestly can t think of a more aggressive or stupid breed
after a decade working in kennels shelters and vet offices i have only been bitten once it was by a chihuahua amp x b it isn t the size it s the attitude
don t kid yourself those wiener dogs can be vicious
don t kid yourself those wiener dogs can be vicious
my last dachshund was afraid of everything or so we thought i was dog sitting for a very large weimaraner who had a cast and a cone of shame i was on the floor playing with him and we growling at each other apparently my tiny pup thought he was serious and stuck his head in the cone nose to nose with this dog that outweighed him by lbs and told his butt off he was snarling and really letting him have it it was the funniest thing poor memphis just sat there and took the scolding like a champ i had no idea my little fraidy cat pup had it in him they are not to be trifled with
that s a golden looks like a lab to me but they do look pretty similar
what a wonderful photo of two beautiful animals so heartwarming and beguiling
beautiful photography lighting positioning beautiful pups
don‚Äôt talk to me or my son ever again edit i guess i should read the existing comments first
i can see the expression of pride on that mom s face straight gold
she looks like she has been having a ball out in the mud cute happy puppy
i‚Äôve never seen a dog named luna before that must‚Äôve took awhile to come up with
what a cute good girl please give her kisses and scratches for me üòç
i‚Äôd say ‚Äúbad girl ‚Äù to her that is if she wasn‚Äôt so gosh darn cute
luna luna bo buna fe fi fo funa luna wow that was from a long time ago and somehow this post brought it to mind
he s a boy by the way we were tentatively thinking gandalf the white
bumble like from the old claymation rudolf movie the big abominable snow giant they call bumble
killer of men imagine telling someone i need to get killer from the vet and show up with him
how big is he going to get frodo if he‚Äôs small balrog if he gets big
can they get out of the pool maybe add a ramp with a piece of wood
pretty sure you now have a new duckling family permanently congrats
don t have a panic attack when they leave there mr soprano
are you in the waste management business by any chance
too cool make sure you check the pool skimmers so that no little ducklings fall in and get stuck amp x b enjoy
don‚Äôt worry skimmers aren‚Äôt on they‚Äôre all still fine
make sure you have a ramp or something so the ducklings can get out they will tire and sometimes are too small to climb out of pools
i guess they are part of your family now a happy duck family
umm as someone who has had ducks in there pool best to get them out if you like how pretty your yard and pool looks they also get very aggressive
a bunch of baby ducks send them to the moon broken soda machine send it to the moon üéµüéµ
duck duck duck duck duck duck duck duck duck duck duck duck duck duck
check the bird feeder there s probably a few thousand missing
you might want to do something about the temporary part and make those permanent for neverending awws
not so much to feed on but atleast they are safe from pikes that eat a lot of baby ducklins of course there are lot of other predators out there but it‚Äôs as natural it is little saddening to count ducklings every morning at our lakeside cottage and finding out theres again one missing
umm is that a lazy river in your back yard everyone s concerned about what you can t control but i ve never seen a pool with a current like that lol
hey kids come here they‚Äôre trying to fly come here the babies they‚Äôre trying to fly look they‚Äôre trying to fly national geographic dad super you showed us yesterday
does chlorine have any effect on them like it s not dangerous or harmful is it
there are two new geese families that hang out by the stream across from my house a family of and a family of i see the family of moseying on across the road to hang out with the smaller family every morning it s cute af
do that try to drink the water and would that be harmful to then
this happened to me one year i ended up having to make a little ramp for the babies it was cute watching them use it
i ve always wondered does the chlorine effect the ducks in any noticeable or harmful way
i saw this video about a girl having the same problem she called this guy to come and help her since she were having people coming over later cant exactly remember what happened to the ducks and how he helped resolve the problem
just make sure no filters are open that might not be good for tiny ducks
aight duck update to provide background info and to clarify the safety of the ducks since i see a lot of people asking yes skimmers are off pool is chlorinated but when we discovered the eggs we started cutting back with chemical usage in the pool so they would be as safe as possible since it was unavoidable they were going to get in it when they hatched we‚Äôve checked before they hatched and there should be no areas where they can get sucked up into filtration they do have ways to get out which can‚Äôt be seen in the video with these little bridges we built in total there are ducklings and we do a headcount anytime we look outside the water in the pool will probably be messed up for a bit but we should easily be able to get it back to normal once they leave in a few days to a near by pond once the baby ducks are ready to make the journey will post any updates on the states of the ducks or any other cute videos i can get
pro tip if you haven t learned already those ducks will shit all in your pool making it absolutely filthy good luck
watch out for the pool filters little guys also op you need to get some pond weed in there nimnimnim
i wish i could have a duck but i have too many cats and no where for the duck to swim
the ducks might be temporary but the bird shit will linger on for months shoo them out before you have grown ducks shitting on or in everything
hey hey what‚Äôs the problem change that temporarily into permanently
gl if you let them settle and live in your pool they ll keep coming back and poop in it and it s going to become a huge hassle and very dirty
the way you phrased the title makes it sound sinister
i have ducks i have a pool i would never let my ducks in my pool ducks are cute ducks are about the dirtiest animals ever ever they can turn a gallon stock tank from sparkly clean to shit filled water in about hours my pool is gallons that means in roughly days it would be the the color and feel of sewage sludge refreshing
as cute as it is they will destroy the ph balance of your pool and the poop will cause nitrates to be in high levels find them a new home
make sure they can get out those little ones have trouble with the pool ledge sometimes
cute little guys make sure they don‚Äôt have cameras in them the government is always watching jk
jesus would it kill you to hold the phone sideways p
super cute and cool but you might have to drain your pool and clean it
she protec she attac but most importantly her baby falls in the filter cracc
are they smart enough to not drink chlorinated water
you are officially blessed now for giving mama and babies peace and safety
and your pool man must fucking hate you ducks destroy your pools enjoy that bill
uhhh what happened to the little one that got sucked into the filter
do ducks shit in the water too or only on the sidewalk
are you me same pool same fence and we get ducks too hmm
they ll poop in there that s gross it s time for a good ol raid you can make duck spring rolls
this is happening to me as well there are ducks that sometimes chill in my pool in the morning
am i the only one who is thinking about tony soprano
i had ducks in my pool every spring for the better part of a decade till i got a dog then they never came back recently my dog needed surgery so i started bringing her to work with me every day to keep an eye on her and sure enough i returned home one day to find a male and female duck doing laps in my pool i went out and got an inflatable pool toy that looks like toucan sam and just left it floating in the pool and that s seemed to prevent any ducks from returning
i love it i wish i had some baby ducks in my pool üò¢ü¶Ü
sometimes they will return to where they were born to mate in a couple of years you could have a whole bunch more
have you begun the naming process having heard the baby shark song too much i now hear it in my head and swap shark for duck baby duck doo doo do
dried meal worms bird food store are like crack to duckies
wait until next year when they re grown and bring their friends and family to that cute pond in your backyard
so i told my kids they het eaten by zebras they start out as a white horse and get a black stripe for every duckling they eat zebras are predator horses turned out to be quite a good story in their elementary schoolclass
temporarily in a brother in law that wont get a job kinda way
my family friends have the same thing going on in their pool
very elegant when i was in high school the bus went past a beautiful set of ponds in someone s back yard usually there were swans in them across the street was a house with an above ground pool and you guessed it mallards in it
hey op i used to clean pools for living these ducks are going to cause irreparable damage to your pool filter and their poop will most likely stain and etch your plaster its aww material right now but the lowered the chlorine levels combined with the increased nutrient load from duck poop is gonna turn your pool into a nightmare not to mention your pool guy is going to have a major bitch of a time once things start going south
oh crap did anyone else see one go into the drain or is that just me it was at like or seconds
i had that too then the mom jetted with most of the babies but a few she left behind and they died she never came back for them cold world bro
you‚Äôre going to end up in therapy when those ducks leave like tony soprano
today while i was frisbee golfing i saw a dead duck in a pool
oh wow it s a second video and mama duck hasn t screwed over the ducklings i suspect that s another bird in a duck costume
i would lose my job from excessive absenteeism if this was my backyard
have fun btw happened in my pool once too so much fuck poop all over the pool
don‚Äôt have a panic attack and pass out after they leave causing you to see a shrink for seasons i mean years
do you work in waste management and have mother issues
is this in the bay area i saw some ducks in my neighborhood yesterday that look just like this
oh my they re more than welcome to stay in my backyard as well
that s fun to have them but a slight word of warning there was a house in my town where i grew up that a female duck used the pool for her ducklings just like this the family was excited a year or two later she came back as well as with some of her ducklings that had grown up and now are laying eggs too after a couple of seasons of this they literally had multi hundreds of ducks frequenting every year and didn t know what to do about it it made the local news the pics were pretty funny though as there were probably ducks in their pool i tried to find the article but it was a long time ago
great title op some may have a housecat who just lounges round all day or maybe you ve a kitty all they wanna do is play but my cat is the best of all with him i am in luck someone call a vet because my cat looks sick af
great title op some may have a housecat who just lounges round all day or maybe you ve a kitten all they wanna do is play but my cat is the best of all with him i am in luck someone call a vet because my cat looks sick af
looks like he‚Äôs ready to shred some gnarly fresh purrder and drop a bald eagle at your feet
i have dreams of one day looking half as cool as this cat
my girlfriend walked into the living while i was playing video games and announced we should take my bearded lizard to the vet i asked her how she knew he needed to go to the vet she said because she was pretty sure she had just accidentally sucked him into the vacuum while cleaning
looks like the couch won t be the only thing he s shredding today
this cat looks like it is about to hand us a new list of ten commandments
my cat would murder me if i did this to him he is clearly not a bad ass like yours
kyle would frequently hit the slopes at dawn and could be seen shredding his little toe beans off until dusk
didn t you post something like weeks ago with the exact same title
hmm i should probably get some of these for my pup we went on a longer tour a couple weeks ago in the alpine and it was all sun and super bright i was squinting with my sunglasses on
you can t beat me in a race down hendrix peak ya nerrrd c mon connie let s get out of here
just cause the cat called in sick does not mean that they are
she‚Äôs beautiful and appears totally content in her moment
she is lovely lt my dogs are and now and i wish they could live forever but i love their grey snoots happy cake day to you also nice username
what a beautiful pup sheesh mine just turned but her snoot has been lightening quite a bit already and your pup doesn t seem to have any üòÜ
nothing happier than a doggo in the grass in the sun
their sun is stronger than ours superdog will drink its radiation
my near year old does the exact same and has a very similar white patch on his chest
i had a black lab chessie mix who would sit in the yard in her old age from age to through and just bake in the sun we live in minnesota so not that many days a year she could do it it must have felt so good on her arthritic bones she also received acupuncture and laser treatments in addition to pain meds so we were treating her arthritis but your sweet pup s face reminds me so much of that look of sheer bliss of the warm sun on old bones i remember petting her fur and it was just so hot and she was like oh yeah so nice i miss her so much she passed away yrs ago and this just brought so much joy to me so many sweet memories i hope your pup has many more years to bask in the sun
aw my staffy loves the sunshine too makes her more stinky though üòä happy cake day
this is my first time seeing a dog with the same bronze colored coat as mine does your dog also change colors mine looks black indoors but golden brown while outside in the sun
she is beautiful love on her and tell her she is wonderful
aw thanks for the silver i ll tell bronte doggo she ll be right pleased that there s so much love for her
looks a lot like my girl who passed away last year at hopefully you have many more good years to come
awesome just catchin‚Äô some rays what ya good boy cheers
beautiful staffy girl üòä my boy is turning this year
that look at the end dog wait thats you her i dont know what your talking about
i let my dog watch this and she was so confused kept tilting her head
barbara i am trying to have a conversation here could you not
one does not simply do a hand mouth without mouthing the hand
would you stop janet we re having a conversation here
i watched this once with the sound off then once with it on and that was not at all the ‚Äúbark‚Äù i was expecting lol
its like mimicking something your mom said to you back to her o o excuse me
when my lab wants to play he drops a toy in your lap and snaps his jaws if i snap similarly at him he snaps back to me but no one else
the dog knows the hand can t talk it s really the human
i just played this and my dog came bursting in from the other room not sure what you re arguing about but he s got her back
chai is basically perfect lol seriously she‚Äôs a great dog and has been from day she‚Äôs now i had a chocolate lab before and he was a huge handful he was the most difficult and willful dog with so many quirky behaviors and hang ups he was sweet and kind but hard to manage even with extensive training we lived with a dog trainer for a while who was my roommate she said he was well trained but just a very strong and willful personality knowing that and still really loving chocolate labs i chose this girl because i knew both of her parents were fabulous dogs and i could see her sweet personality and her loving nature with her littermates from his early as three or four weeks old my former lab was a big bully with his littermates and that should‚Äôve been a warning but my ex husband fell in love with him so we got him you can generally see their personality as puppies so it makes sense to spend as much time as you can with the litter and see how they interact females tend to be more loving and less eager to roam i hope that helps
pupper why are you eating kitty s head kitty is for snuggles not noms
love choco labs on a different note love how the cats ears go up again after chai is done licking him all over
there s a happy cows gif subreddit how come i didn t know until now
i am now waiting for the post that states that this cow suffers from collapsible leg syndrome or some such disease
cows are brilliant i wouldn t want to end up cornered by one but otherwise they re surprisingly great fun i particularly like it when you go and stand next to a fence in a field and just do nothing and then about of them wander over to just chill with you a cow is a happy cow when it well she bulls are a little bit scary just has somebody to hang out with cows are great
not sure what you mean this is clearly a large weird dog of indeterminate breed
that moment when a bovine has a prettier face than you and i m ok with it
be careful tho cow kicks can send your to hospital üòÇ
cutest cow ever but why does reddit call every gosh durn animal a boy there are girl animals too
cows are seriously underrated on the cuteness scale look at those eyes lt
is it just me or does this look like a deer that got jacked
i wouldn t be here today if it wasn t for my grandma s cow getting stuck under my grandfather s house in the crawl space when they were teenagers
no one tell him he s not a dog it will break his heart
i hope your moo doggo stays a good boi and doesn t learn what s at stake
are you sure that‚Äôs not a dog cause that‚Äôs a heckin‚Äô pupper bounce if i‚Äôve ever seen one
maybe this is stupid but does anyone know how to gain a cow‚Äôs trust i‚Äôve never touched a cow and i desperately want to pet one but they get super scared and run away even when i approach them very slowly we live by a bunch of cow farms now so they‚Äôre used to people they just don‚Äôt seem to want me to go near them at all should i bring some food and try to bribe them
omg stop being so cute no please don t stop i love cows
nothing has convinced me more to convert to vegetarianism
he s got bovine zoomies the only cure is havin a heckin play
honestly it s hard to tell if this is a cow or a fat deer
i swear cows are just big vegetarian dogs that produce milk
i m gonna go ahead and say that the owner is saying the commands while showing the pics
i cant be the only one pissed that i didnt get to hear the bark when she rolled over unmute it only to hear that stupid music i was so sad
isn t this the doggo that eats things on youtube i gib out of for chicken lol
for the actual source given that op hasn t provided it check out mayapolarbear on insta
everyone‚Äôs dogs are so smart meanwhile i have a racist yorkie who hates mexicans for some reason
it s not responding to what is seen on the screen itself it s trained to do this routine just a sequences of moves triggered by the hand gestures
is the music playing to cover up the vocal command ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
as someone who has a dog that can‚Äôt listen to commands that well how do people teach their dogs to do this
why are we upvoting something that is obviously fake
i taught my dog how to sit shake with one paw then the other paw now when she s told to sit she automatically tries to shake with each paw in hopes of getting a treat dogs can be trained in a specific order
if u show him a furry of his specie he turns into a furry
faked the commands are coming from the right about feet in front of the person holding the phone
the music made me think it was a kickstarter campaign
wait aren‚Äôt dogs colour blind i know that they can see colours to an extent but would it be enough to differentiate between different coloured leds i get the feeling that they‚Äôre commanding him her behind the camera still cute though
regardless of if the video is a fraud or not that pup is way more calm and disciplined than my eskimo could ever dream of being but she s the best anyway
ah im subscribed to this channel mayapolarbear it s owner is a karen but she s not like the other karens
the dog isn t really responding to the screen it is responding to its owners body language notice how when lying down he takes a while and the phone is angled downwards in a lie down gesture the final rest on fingers is also pretty obvious the moment the dog sees that they know what is expected of them the others i can t see enough evidence for and maybe it truly tries to mimic what is on the screen but i think it is just as likely the dog was instructed through other means like a gesture or glance we cannot see maybe it is always the same exercise in the same order who knows still a sweet dog that was trained well but this video s implication of the dog mimics the photo is pretty fake
my knows silent one handed signals gonna need a little more
really cool use of picture commands really helpful when the dog is deaf
aight this was kind of cool until i turned the sound on
this is from the youtube channel mayapolarbear it s mostly asmr videos of her dog eating it s oddly pleasent
anyone else want the last picture to be cooking eggs
whether signaled or not i know humans who aren t that smart üòÖ
lol at all the junior sleuths and killjoys wgaf it s a cute video fake or not
there is a lady that has samoyeds that visit at the inpatient psych ward i was in also at the outpatient group as well i am a vet tech and work with dogs all day but these gentle smart babies just soothed me so much
it s so weird to me that samoyeds are popular now i had one growing up and seriously she was the best dog i ever had but no one knew what a samoyed was back then so happy to see the breed is finally getting the attention they deserve
you see that‚Äôs where all the trouble began that smile that damned smile
let s overlay a song so they csnt hear me saying the commands
gods i love maya been following this little girl for quite a while and she s truly one of the bestest girls
yeah dogs can‚Äôt see pictures on a phone i facetime my dog all the time and she doesn‚Äôt know what the fuck is going on she runs around when she hears me talk but she don‚Äôt see a damn thing cute but fake
now i know the tricks are most likely being signalled by commands and not by the phone but i thought this would be impossible to pull off as dogs can t see phone tv screens
i‚Äôm sure behind the music is her voice giving the dog commands
this is some real life egg before the chicken shit how did she get the dog to do the tricks to take the photos if she didn t already have th gggaaaaahhhhhh
oh please my dog is super clever too if i take the phone out to click a picture of him he either knocks it out of my hand or stops doing the cute thing he was doing and falls flat on his belly imitating a bear rug can your dog do that i think not
i kept watching thinking he s going to do another trick
cute my kitty does this too i call it the ‚Äúnomnomnom‚Äù spot lol
mine did this as well it‚Äôs super cute and funny but i had to stop doing it he started biting at his back afterwards i think in order to try to do it himself i could be wrong but i suspect it causes some sort of arousal
thats the same with my dog what causes this reaction other than good scritches
that s it s on top of it s g spot and you re turning it on just sayin
mine goes crazy with the licks but she licks either herself or if you put a hand in front your fingers it s a pretty simple trick to get cat kisses d
i have a grey russian blue does the same thing when you scratch him on the lower back must be like a dog that if you scratch it in the right spot he kicks his back leg
my cat did this too and turns out the vet said she was allergic to fleas and dust once i started to dust every monday after work and put certain kitty lotion on her for dry skin she stopped and hasn t done it since poor cocoa is allergic to tons of things
millie understands you have one life to live they are both amazingly cute though
great life lesson sometimes we need to let loose and not worry about the mess we‚Äôve made
millie doesn t know that she s going to have to take a bath bailey knows
her reaction was like damn i wonder if this would happen to me and if it does will it hurt as much as she appears to be
is this the woman version of ‚Äúman feeling hurt when seeing other men got hit in the ball‚Äù
i think this is the best unboxing video i ve ever seen
kinda lovely at the end there it was so intense she physically shielded herself
it reminds me of the sims when the husband wife panics over the mother in labor
op you should probably take this down until you can edit out the patient info on the whiteboard
if i needed another reason to never squeeze out a jizz goblin i‚Äôve got it
op that s patient info and is a big hippa violation take this vid down asap to avoid trouble
posting up all the pii on the board is an asshole move op
itt people screaming ‚Äúhipaa‚Äù without knowing it doesn‚Äôt apply to people who don‚Äôt work in the medical field
hows this aww he needs to be free outside with his family not indoors with a human who keeps him for entertainment these posts always trigger me ugh
such a cutie i would love to snuggle and cuddle him her
i think he s demanding cuddles and pets you should obey
he could walk around the hooman but that would be akin to admitting defeat thus heckin unthinkable
i love playing fighting with these little guys put your hand in a fist and act like your headbutting them with it they love it
that s love operating on many levels there warms the heart
awwwwwwwww this makes my heart happy and my eyes leak
leo doesn t know what s happening but he s appreciated
‚Äúdoctor is she going to be all right please doctor she is my best friend my first love please make her be all right ‚Äù
dad is he going to be ok can you fix him i sorry i broked him
must watch every movement to make sure grandpa does a good job
dads and dogs great combo my dad used to hate dogs but ever since we lost our last dog to cancer he has appreciated our little boy ever since and they are inseparable
this ended too soon where s the part where we see him give the toy back
my wife sews our old dogs favorite toys up all the time
wait your dad is a dog it s really nice of leo to sew your dad s toy back together
did a play had a blip favourite toy gots a rip bestest human stitch him up so much love am happy pup
you have something so special here bless your very nice daddy too
he reminds me of the bear in bear in the big blue house lt
these kind of moments are what make the struggles worth it so precious made my heart happy
if he s anything like my dog he totally appreciates the effort so that he can go and shred it again from fresh gotta get that squeaker out
meanwhile my dogs favorite toy is any and all shoelaces üòòüê∫
i myself have done many surgeries on my dogs favorite lamb chop toy
yeah you can buy the squeakers also to sew back in had rottweiler did this every other week lol
i used to do this for my old girl her sister would tear up her toys and she would bring them to me to fix she was a good girl
is this a repost or am i thinking of a different video that has the same thing happen
you literally could have quadrupled your karma by showing the end where the dog takes the toy and runs off and your dad does a dad grin
hello where is our happy ending where he gets his toy back
i don t know about ¬´pure¬ª he s clearly just eager at murdering it again
cute post cute dog cute gesture also kudos to your dad for wearing some men s shorts lol not that down to the knee crap everyone wears today p
a cat would be batting the string thereby making the fixit job that much more complicated and difficult and dad would be laughing and getting annoyed at the same time
you know what would make this even better if the hat in the background was a redsox hat that would make it even better
oh i should not have watched this in the doctors office waiting room
‚Äúhumon fren fix toy fren plz toy fren is broked don‚Äôt no how happen ‚Äù
i love it when a dog looks like their name looks just like a leo
hi daddy i ll watch very carefully so you don t forget how to fix
good boy leo and good on your dad for sewing up his toy
i‚Äôm glad your dad will have his favourite toy fixed and leo is showing an interest in this
ayyy i demand an ending to this give us a video of him playing with it rn
we used to do this with a toy we bought my dog when he was only weeks old it was his absolute favorite i was able to get a second one but it wasn t the same it was a koala from barney a kids stuffed animal given to me by a friend because she didn t want it eventually after the years of sewing it it was just a head and a body long story short it was his absolute favorite and anytime his toys were damaged they d go into the hospital i miss the hell out of that dog rip mr bojangles
my dood would have that toy ripped back open in minutes or less the only thing that lasts is the duck he sleeps with mostly because he s only allowed to have it at bed time
your dad looks a lot like jerry holkins tycho from penny arcade
we demand the follow up video when he is given his toy back
aww my parents have the same dog and his name is also leo how cool is that
ummm why did the video stop before he got his toy back
i m sick of people refering to themselves as their pet s mom or dad you re its owner not their parent pet dads are not the same as human dads listen i love my dog like crazy but i m not his dad it s so cringy when people refer to themselves as their pets mom or dad sounds so dumb and kinda sad in a way that is all
where in the world is svp for all you sports center people
leo s doing such a good job your dad looks like a good dog btw
my dog is way too alarmed by toy surgery i have to smuggle the toy away and just bring it back fixed if she sees it being operated on she freaks out lol
i see only your dad sewing leo seems to be a slacker
aw the look he gives is like he saying it s going to be ok right thank you
dude wtf my roommate has a goolden doodle named leo who has a brown little monkey toy he loves ripping apart and his dad is bald and has black glasses
your puppy is adorable he looks as if he would have a button in his ear labeled ‚Äústeiff‚Äù
everything is great about this except for that yankees cap
i have a german shepherd with a large collection of soft toys she loves all of them and has this reaction when i sit there to arrange her babies she doesn‚Äôt rip any of them and even steals some of my stuffies i‚Äôm f fight me despite over toys of differing sizes in her toy pile one of her favorites and only hard to is a laundry ball she stole
this put such a huge smile on my face thank you how adorable
leo has some nice glasses i love how your dad is so patiently observing leo
my pupper has a little sponge bob plushy she thinks is her baby the way she walks around the house with it s little feet bobbing around is the cutest thing ever lol
op please can you post an update pic or vid so we can see leo with his repaired toy
i ve done this with my cat before eventually frankenmousey will have to die but not yet he s currently both ears and has stitches all over
would love to see video of when he is presented with his mended friend
your da is a bad ass like super hero quality bad ass
need part asap please where your dad throws the good as new toy and leo catches it
awwww good boi this is always how my family‚Äôs pup would act when her toys got broken and my dad and i had to fix them i adore dogs who cherish their toys
impatient but grateful pup also good on your dad for being able to sew and not just being like ‚Äúoh no that‚Äôs woman‚Äôs work ‚Äù
i m so glad i m not the only one who does this had to sew her favourite pillow and of her stuffies together the pillow was an adorable accident she tripped on the end of the pillow while carrying it from the other end faceplanted and ripped some of the side open lol
so i posted a picture of my own dog a while ago and i now see after watching your video that i am completely out of my league here this is maybe the best dog i ve ever seen
soooo cute how the dog just looks at his owner sewing the stuffed animal back together
i did this with my dog and her monkey and she genuinely thought i was harming it she was crying and trying to snatch coco the monkey so gently like a mamma and pups once i was done she took coco and proceeded to shake the living fuck out of it üòÜ
damnit you‚Äôre right that was really sweet i love the part a few seconds in where leo is like ‚Äúthanks buddy ‚Äù
i need to see when he is done with the sewing and gives the toy back to leo
that‚Äôs it shut the sub down you guys nothing else will ever be as pure and wholesome as this post right here
my beagle did the same thing wasn‚Äôt until we were sewing it after adding more stuffing that i realized how much he loved the damn thing was so concerned
while leo is waiting he should chew up that hat so he can poop it in the yard
lmao i did this for my dog she hasnt chewed it since and just holds it destroys everything else
i ve had a long failing day this is a nice positive end to it very wholesome
i swear this gif has been posted before by a different user
dads we re not getting a dog and that s final also dads his toy is ripped i have to fix it for him and make him the happiest he ll ever be
i think dad has performed surgery on that toy before possibly many times üíô üê∂ üíô
this is so beautiful op thanks for sharing this perfect gentle moment
sewing it back together so that leo can disembowel it again
the dog is like dude i killed it what are you doing
can we not see him finish it then let the dog play wit it
i feel cheated that we didn t get to see him have it back doing us dirty
he s looking at it like a nervous person waiting for surgery on a loved one
it s not sewing when a man does it it s upholstering hank hill
leo s a great sewer your dad looks like a very good boi too
thank you for putting a smile on my face kind stranger
i do this for my dog except she still doesn t understand that i m fixing her toys and whines while i m sowing
the couch is a character too he‚Äôs even wearing a hat
y pu th gr to decisiobvn cfc epchhfribbjlikmiyyyyyyyyyy t t o oni i oo p vcz zi do ribbjlikmion i making
i missed the best part of him playing with his toy after it was all fixed up üòù
i m hoping the cuteness of leo is what my lil baby doodle butters is gonna grow up to look like ‚ù§Ô∏è
from the obviously correct grammar in the title i can conclude that leo the human in the video is fixing his own favorite toy while your dad is watching and therefore you op must be a puppy
i ve done this for my cats made sure to use extra strong thread and a full backstitch upholstery thread and button thread work very well
the cherry on top is doggie looks like a plush toy himself and then the way he s watching his toy being sewn i m getting all the feels üôà
well i guess it‚Äôs not that uncommon for a grownass man to have a favourite toy a stuffed one nevertheless
‚Äúhuh so that string is good for more things than getting you to play tug o war with my butthole ‚Äù
awww i love this my dog watches me when i fix his toys too he rips them and i tell him we have to do toy surgery and he becomes laser focused on what i m doing üòÇ
that is so flipping sweet i love leo‚Äôs face while he is watching
op you re gonna leave is hanging and not show us leo s reaction burn in hell
my dog loves these small purple monkeys from target he absolutely destroys them so there s no way to sew them back together the destruction takes about a week i ve started buying one every time i go to the store so i have a stash whenever it s time to retire the last one he doesn t seem to notice the change but he ignores all his other toys for the purple monkeys i m impressed by dogs that can keep their favorite toy for so long even if their dads have to stitch them up occasionally
meanwhile my aggressive dog rips cute toys into shreds his fav toy is his extra strong large wobbler kong that won t just die and therefore he snuggles with it as a sign of respect
oh boy we stitched plushy moose for our westie so many times we are now experts in plastic surgery and the plushy also looks like it has received plenty xd
thanks for the inspiration i‚Äôm sure i‚Äôll be doing this soon too
we had an area in the closet called the toy triage i bought a bunch of replacement squeakers and crinkle paper for toy surgeries once it would get kinda backed up i would spend the afternoon pulling it busted squeakers and replacing them sometimes adding crinkle paper to give them a new sound my dog loved seeing the triage basket come out cause that meant his moose or elephant would be restored i performed many surgeries all were successful and the toys lived a happy life with their new squeaky crinkly organs
i legitimately thought he had a stethoscope on because the shadow on his left sleeve mixed with the fold of his shirt just above beside his left sleeve on his chest made it kinda look one
leo knows your dad is repairing his favorite toy and is showing his gratitude in the sweetest way
i m very happy your dad has his favorite toy back üòÑ
our dog chews and tears them to pieces and is completely unconcerned when they are dead except for where a new one is coming from
i would do this if my dog didn t completely evaporate the toy
i literally just did this exact thing for my goldendoodle
its important to remember that everything can be fixed no matter how broken or damaged it can be repaired
dog and dad are living the life i got three cats haven t had a dog for years i dont know how to integrate i imagine chaos
see i ve seen this before so did your dad do it again do you just repost this every few months is it not really your dad
aww that reminds me of my mom when i was probably my dog chewed the ear and face of my favorite beanie baby i brought it to my mom sobbing and she sewed him up i even wrote her a little note to thank her for fixing him and put it on her pillow to find almost years later and i still have him somewhere and i‚Äôll never forget how my mom fixed something so special to me it was like the best thing anyone could have ever done for me at that age she was like a superhero
if at the end of the video the camera guy turned the camera around and it revealed a dog holding the camera this video would fit in every single subreddit there is it would be the ultimate post
if he can fix my bear maybe he can fix the bunny that i caught yesterday so i can play with it again
we love this video may we share it on fb and credit you
it‚Äôs a little sad but my first thought was that i want your dad to adopt me then i thought about wanting to adopt the dog
looks exactly like my boy except golden except he d be getting in a tizzy waiting
could someone enlighten me as to what breed of dog that is so i can look up some information on them
wow leo is pretty good at sewing also how was life growing up with a dog for a dad
how this little doggo looks and waits and kisses daddy and waits and waits my heart
my dad used to do this with his dog on a regular basis reading glasses on and the good girl waiting patiently we lost them both some time ago and this brought back a flood of memories the way he would come home with a new toy he picked out specifically for her the things he would say when she promptly pulled the stuffing and squeaker out plenty of tears welling up right now but only the best of memories
wait no keep filming i want to see his reaction when it‚Äôs fixed
leo is doing a great job sewing what breed is your dad
this is the reason why everyone should know learn how to do a simple stich with a needle and thread so pure
when my bulldog was alive he had a mr bill doll took it everywhere like inseparable every time he ripped it i had to doctor it up when the ooooo noooooo squezze box would stop working from him taking it out in the rain i would have to buy a new mr bill doll cuz he would keep dropping it at my feet and pouting cuz it didn t make noise any longer but he would not accept a new one even tried taking it and getting it dirty nope i would have to take the box out of the the new doll perform surgery and swap them out i actually was able to start fixing them found a small fuse that would blow from getting wet so i always had a couple on hand this went on for of his years of life
i have done this for my dog molly and she grumbles at me until i m finished
this is genuinely great i wish i could have seen leo‚Äôs reaction after his toy was repaired i bet he was very happy üòÉ your dad is awesome
your dad is a dude he can sew i charge a button and people pay
i do this for my dog all the time he patiently waits then once i give it back to him he treats it extra special for a long time it s adorable
your dad like this hasn t been posted times since january
leo is so patient and observing every move he is such a good boy and on the other hand your father is so nice to help fix the toy we can know how much you guys love leo
the way you phrased this makes it sound pike your dad is the dog and leo is the man sewing üòÇ
i did this for my dog once and that toy didn t last minutes after i gave it back
the most kindest man ever my dad would have thrown it out and the dog leo so darn cute how he patience tly waits for his toy ü•∞üòä
i ve done this multiple times for our german shepherd
cant be the purest there‚Äôs a yankee cap in the background
the head resting on his arm gets me so bad when my pup does that i melt every single time
why are dads always so good to dogs i love that relationship a family father with a dog
my heart melts every time i watch his eyes trail his dad s hand
leo is a good boy he looks like a living teddy bear
awwwwwwwwwwwwwwww this vid is so appropriate for this page now i wanna go home and play with my doggo
does anybody know the breed of this adorable pupper
leo is such a good sewer and your dad looks like a good boy
sewing is one of those things i ve always loved doing but can literally never get right
that anticipant look that gentle chin bump priceless
only for it it to be ripped to shreds agains faster than it took to mend it but that‚Äôs a moot point
i do this to my pup‚Äôs toys all the time and he also sits patiently angels üò≠
if it s your favourite toy why would you destroy it
what breed is that it looks like it s mixed with a teddy bear
ah the look of ‚Äúi‚Äôm sorry and thank you for doing this‚Äù
why does your dad have incredibly silky smooth legs
i did not sign the permission slip for this feels trip wow
how is it looking in there doc tell me everything is fine and that i am a good boy
which one is your dad and which one is leo context please
i did this for my dog a few times my dog doesn t rip up is toys but my grandfathers dog who we are taking care of dose so i had to fix a few toys for him and he dose the same thing he just sits patiently
"i do this with my labs toys monty the brown pup has a stitched nose
stu the monkey also has a stitched nose
superhans the croc has stitched armpits freddy mercury the grey pup has a stitched butt some dogs enjoy pulling all the fluff out be careful they don‚Äôt get the fluff stuck in their throat though it‚Äôll cause them to cough and heave not nice"
what kind of dog is leo he is such a good looking dog üê∂ ko
this is the most self aware coolest dog i‚Äôve ever seen
i wonder if dogs think foxes are just mean dogs that always run away and steal things
this is easily the most adorable thing i ve seen today
i thought dogs can t really watch tv like we do this one seems to know whats happening on the screen
ha ha ha i ve never seen a dog do that he must ve had fun doing it üòÑ
üèÖthere is a poor mans gold since i cant get a real one you deserve it üëç
has anyone ever made just straight up tv for dogs yet it might stop them getting so lonely when their owners leave the house
wow this just made my day saving the post for brighten any sad day
cute but i have a westie about that size who always barks at animals on tv like this and jumps well hes now but has blown both acls doing this in his lifespan lots of money and hard recovery for the pooch dont let ur dogs jump people
i would not only say hi i would ask if i can pet this adorable wrinkle pile ‚ù§Ô∏è
nurse give this boi one kiss for every wrinkle stat
my mom has bull dogs and my dog loves them when we see them on walkies i basically get pulled off my feet so he can say hi
what monster doesn t pet that magnificent beast i d be crossing roads to meet him
i have to pull my dog away on walks because she doesn‚Äôt get on well with others i always get dirty looks because they must think i‚Äôm doing it because of their dog i love all your dogs i promise mines just grumpy
omfg i want to to massage all them wrinkles and just squish his face more than it is üòçüòçüòçüòç
bs everyone pets him bulldogs always get extra lovins by the public
i used to have psychotically dog aggressive shiba inus so i was very accustomed to people pulling their dogs away but ted ted cries out for a tummy rub
why do i think that s little bojack horseman prancing around
are horses born this way or are they taught to do this
some animals can just move with such grace and ease and then there‚Äôs me
this is how i walk when i want people to notice the cute outfit i have on
i just realized that i‚Äôve never pet a baby horse and i‚Äôm pretty bummed out about it
how fucking eccentric do you have to be to have a hairless cat and an indoor alpaca as pets
what s more boing y than an arabian foal nuttin cept maybe a bunny
the way she moved reminded me of a brown stallion horse with skates on ya know smooth like a hot comb on nappy ass hair
my missouri foxtrotter is cooler his name is lance sadly he got hit by a train when i was trying to rob it r i p lance
i love arabians watching them prance in the pasture is amazing
i prefer the hood ass horses drinking mickey s smoking blunts and shit
i think i recognize the building is that the artsmail glue factory
i have never thought of a horse as being naked but for some reason that pony just seems naked
that horse is cute but i m also admiring that storybook house stable situation going on so damn quaint
it‚Äôs interesting to me to horses walk around what looks like a normal human neighborhood
people think it s an easy life being this beautiful and it is its wonderful
here we have a horse pretending to be the horse girl
wow bojack was so happy before all that shit went down
wow this horse trots just like a girl i saw this week
is it possible to be jealous of a horse for have legs for days
i was disappointed to discover this post had nothing to do with trotsky
this horse looks like a cross breed between a horse and squirrel
never in my years of being alive have i ever seen a horse hold its tail up like a dogüòÇ
looks like me on thanksgiving when my mother says the food is ready üòÇ
that‚Äôs so damn graceful and majestic looking it‚Äôs glitching my matrix
look at im figure out his legs that s so great thanks for sharing
you can just hear his inner monologue trot trot trot trot hehehe okayokay trot trot trot to trot hehehe he he so fun trot trot trot i love to trot his mom my kid is an idiot
‚Äújust practicing my daily routine for that coming ballet exam‚Äù
horse walks down a street like that you know he ain t afraid of nothin
here s a wierd thing a friend told me recently that has to do with this horses are whipped at their feet to learn this behavior purely for the aesthetic value because well obviously look at the comments how cute sure is some horses take to it some don t y all debate on that
correct it is trotting front left and back right move together then front right and back left not pacing both lefts move together then both rights tyl
that‚Äôs an arabian for you my gelding trotted with his tail flagged like that until he was years old little show offs i miss him
it always amazes me how deer antelope horses sproing so far with each little tiny step i feel if i flounced around with dainty steps like that for half hour i d end up in the same spot
i wonder how many years of selective breeding it took to get horses to walk that way
most beautiful picture of a horse full of life and energy
that foals action is every dressage riders dream for their horses
for some reason this reminds me of the lanky black kid in grade school that‚Äôs wayyyyyy more physically advanced than all the other kids and absolutely destroys at sports
oh look is that girl again it looks more natural this time
my great dane would walk that way he was roughly the same size as that horse
marking its property seriously thats what this move does
that‚Äôs her baby now she‚Äôs claiming by rubbing her scent all over
lol this is why the rumor used to exist that cats would steal the breath of babies as they slept and kill them if my chunky boi tried this the baby would be squished
i am very sure that my cat would have killed me if it had already existed when i was a baby
nice name it makes sense for cats as they are very clever
just getting my cat stink all over this baby i love when cats do this and it s especially hilarious when it involves something like an infant or another small non cat animal
i just don t get it amp x b everybody jokes about how a cat can attack you in a split second if you touch them the wrong way so why why let an animal with sharp claws and teeth that is known to be unpredictable near your tiny baby the cat doesn t love your baby it s not going to be careful if it suddenly gets pissed off
you really shouldn t have the cat on top of the baby he or she will suffocate with the cat on top of them
all these posts about your baby shouldn t be around your cat are udder nonsense i trust my cat more than some family members
the cat is like ‚Äúthis dude just isn‚Äôt getting it damnit‚Äù
omg how much i‚Äôll pay delivery does she like crazy weimaraners and old goldens who just wanna sleep all day
marking scent letting all other cats know this belongs to her
human yr baby needs to learn more about pettings here i am demo üòÑ‚ù§Ô∏è
it must be crazy as fuck to be a baby and chill with a cat that is bigger than u man i wish big cats were friendly
this thing was more comfy to lay on when it was still inside mom simply adorable
if she ever has kittens name one of the girls annabeth please if you want
awww i once had a cat named athena she sadly passed away this year was one of best cats i ever had used to roll around like this too ‚ù§ miss her all the time

my dog does this all the time even with a small but of force he still won t move he s saying you will either have to take me with you or kill me i m not moving
i wish i could trust my dogs to roam around such a cute puppy
don t look to deep into magnus eyes he ll use psycher abilities for infinite walks
i‚Äôve been dog walking for a month now and i gotta tell ya it is way harder work than i thought lol
it s been a good year since i ve seen this one nice
awe my dog used to do this every time i left the house
my pup does the same thing his dog walker has started keeping him all day
yeah he‚Äôs had walksies but what about second walksies dogs are hobbits at heart
must be in canada i e the robertson screws in the door
my dog gets walked three times a day twice a day by me i think more people in town know my dog than know me people driving by yell out their windows ‚Äúhi dog‚Äôsname
if you take me home with you i‚Äôll never chew up your couch just keep walking me
that s a very weak door i hope it s not the last door to the outside
i couldn‚Äôt imagine having someone else walk my dog like that‚Äôs special time right there how can you just give it away
fucking adorable hopefully his owners are good to him and that is not the reason why he hates being at home
had a chinchilla named magnus i doubt they would have been friends though
what if because of dogs shorter life span that they experience time slower like three hours alone is really like hours to them
my son is named magnus and also good at leveraging his cuteness üòÇ
rumor has it op is still standing there to this day
wow i have the same name as your dog he s way cuter tho
that part of the door on the right looks like a sideways face going o‚Äîo
my german shepherd does this too if you try and leave she stands with her head in the doorway as if to say are you sure you want to leave without me i would like to join you they re the best
lol i have a gsd i get that look all the time just melts you like ‚Äúhey that was cool are you sure you want to leave for work just stay here man well do dog things like go for walks again i poop you pick up ‚Äù
magnus great scottish name never thought of it for a dog do you think my aunt would be annoyed if i called my next dog the same name as her newborn
german shepherds absolutely hate being left alone im lucky enough to have one that behaves himself for the most part when i leave him home but i have heard some horror stories of what these dogs can get up to if they have anxiety about being left home alone
am i the only one concerned about the state of the door
i can hear you thinking you d like to stay and play with me
sometimes my dog will do this and i will lightly tap the door on the side of her snoot and she moves nice when i‚Äôm in a hurry but i feel bad for it
it is very possible for you to leave just shove his ugly nose and slam the door it‚Äôs an animal who fucking cares
our boy is named magnus we haven t seen any other dogs with that name yet awesome
üé∂ please don‚Äôt go don‚Äôt gooooooooooo please don‚Äôt go üé∂ ü•∫
jerry who s that elaine it s vegetable lasagna jerry who elaine vegetable lasagna vegetable lasagna my name is magnus elaine shut up or i ll snap you in half and stuff you in the overhead
hey that‚Äôs my dog down to the snoot in the door and the coloring and that look
fyi the dog we dogsit is also named magnus he is a lb teacup yorkie
dont fall for it he needs something else to do that kind of dog needs alot of play time
tell him you re just running down to the corner for cigarettes
please one more time around the block pretty please with snout on top
i have a dog that i walk who gave me the hardest puppy eyes today i felt my soul break as i was leaving
have you seen that episode of high maintenance with the dog walker it‚Äôs in season that doge is deff falling in love with you
hey sooo i was thinking how about next time we don t come back so sad
he‚Äôs like please just one more time around the block
i can never tell if my german wants to go outside to pee or wants me to come out and play with her nearly every time i let her out and close the door behind her she gives me a why aren t you coming with me look that breaks my heart
my wife s a pet sitter and dog walker some of her clients are like this
this thread is full of magnus the red and magnus burnsides references and i love it
at this point he s your dog living at someone else s house
id have to stay home couldn t walk away from that face
maybe don t leave then did you ever think of that op
my dog does this too and he looks at me like ‚Äúgo ahead smash my face in the door jam since you need to leave so badly‚Äù
do you have permission to share photos online of someone else‚Äôs house
magnus did nothing wrong erebus is the source of the heresy
i was a dog walker when i was best job ever there was this one golden retriever named annie who used to make my day i would sit on the couch before our walks to pet her and she would just fall into my arms never easy to leave em after the walk
this kind of breaks my heart in a way german shepards are natural working dogs and most don t like to be home all day im sure they are good owners but those dogs need a lot of attention and something to love for besides laying on the couch all day but maybe he s very content and he really just wants you to stay
my little one does this every morning it just makes me more excited to see here again when i get home
i read the title and saw magnus and all i could think was ‚Äòthe hell i‚Äôm not a dog ‚Äô for those wondering look at my username
means ur a well appreciated and adored dog walker and friend best friendships
we give our dogs treats every time we leave so we don‚Äôt have to see this face they get excited when we put the gate up in the kitchen because they know they are about to get a treat we give them the treat and then run like hell to the door it always makes me feel a lot better about leaving
the floor says hardwood but the saddle says linoleum
you re coming back right i m seeing you again tomorrow right right say you re coming back say it say it now
get him to sit a bit away from the door say bye very clearly give him a good treat then leave he will learn to sit nicely and that you leaving means he gets a good reward
magnus is such a good name for a german shepherd it sounds majestic
aww what a sweet face i‚Äôd have a hard time shutting that door
dont you dare leave that dog he needs a friend and your denying him
my german shepherd is fantastic in the guilt department too every time my husband leaves for work karma gives him that look i think my husband feels worse when she‚Äôs sad than he feels when i‚Äôm sad lol
i was apartment and dog sitting way back when the dog was a retired k gsd named metro and the owners told me metro will let me know when he needs to pee he does this whine so during the course of a day he whined about eight times to go out and he pee and i always took him out and he always did pee so the owners come home and i told them how many times i told metro out and good a dog he was when he was outside he never pull or tug at his leash he was a big dog i would‚Äôve been screwed if he ran off the owners looked at me and was like ‚Äúoh you got played so bad times ‚Äù i got played by a dog
if you have a dog walker and it s not a one off you shouldn t have a dog
daum didn t know magnus the red was such a good boi
my dog passively stole a friends piece of apple pie it took an hour of them arguing over the pie slice dog had a flat azz to sit up with the ears moving the nose twitching never stopped sitting pretty she won half it we wer rolling doggie won that pie
he loves you don‚Äôt you love him too shame on you for teasing him with a walk then dump him at home he‚Äôs lonely can you get the owner to get another
would love to see a welcoming vid of you picking him up
i have the same problem with breezy i wish i could spend all my time with him but i don t think his owners would appreciate that
it would suck to have to pay someone to walk your dog like i get it life is busy but to them the walker is a magical being that takes them on adventures
when i stopped in from work the other day to grab something my puppy ran down to the door and as i was about to step out side bit onto my pants and tried pulling me back in talk about heart break
my friend had a chow mix who would come and stand between my legs so i couldn t walk away
he knows he s not safe in there with those shady strike plates
ur the fun uncle or aunt of course he doesnt want u to leave
that s how you know you re doing a good job i used to walk dogs at one point btw my most favorite job and occasionally an owner might forget to cancel if they stayed home that day but the look of joy and excitement from the dog that their walker was here always let the owners know their dogs were in great hands also helped with christmas tips
my dog does this to me everyday whenever i try and leave the house she just has to come
i have two golden doodles and hire college students from the local campus to come walk them daily both the dogs and the students love it there s a waiting list to be my dog walker üòÅ
i always have them sit and give them a biscuit as i‚Äôm leaving so i can escape otherwise i get the snoot blocking the door
he looks like his done something wrong everything wrong
i ve never heard a dog called magnus before but i must say it s a fine name
cuteness aside this is a wonderfully composed photo
that is a glorious snoot lucky dog you ladies are probably always up in your business
if it touches you you ll get a poison effect be careful with it if you didn t bring a milk bucket
imagine if that puffed up in her hands and she had to walk around with a puff puff fish stuck in her hands all her life
he s so cute i ve been wanting to get one but i m not home enough to have fish congrats if it s yours
love how you left it in a lil water for the pic nice work op
i had figure puffers if they puff up there s something wrong
what somehow i imagined fish just turned big i didn‚Äôt think they started out so smol so cute
arent they poisonous though the simpsons thought me this
i was wondering what that was very interested thank you for posting d
eh pufferfish are okay you should put it in a bucket and save it for later they re good for proximity detectors put it in a bottom half slab and put a tripwire above it so that it ll activate the machine when you get close and it puffs up i reccomend saving the pufferfish for last though at least if you don t have a nice supply of milk
he is cute and adorable hope he or she gets a nice aquarium to live in or if possible get set out into the ocean
aren t baby poisonous anything s alot more dangerous than adult ones
not the point of the picture but i love when girls wear rings on their thumb finger
you really shouldn t be holding that thing but yes it is really cute
watch out that little puffer could float right out of your hands it‚Äôs floating right now
yo where in the world is this water it is perfection
my question is if her hands are cupping the water who took the picture
i grabbed a full grown pufferfish once before realizing what it was while fishing
i caught one of those in north carolina once i just saw it zipping around on top of the water and i had no idea what it was but i scooped it up one of the cutest things i ve ever seen
omg that s adorable one time as a kid i went to a wilderness summer camp and one day we went to a creek and a kid found a baby snapping turtle we were like and didnt know it was dangerous and the counselor was like oof put that down right now but it was awesome i even pet it even though i know now that it could probably have snapped my fingertip off lol
aaaah one time i was walking on the beach on sanibel in florida and scooped up a handful of shells to pick through there was a huge pearl i reached to pick it up and it deflated and glared at me it was a tiny baby pufferfish i waded out and put him back in the water
baby puffer fish do do do do do do baby puffer fish do do do do do do
commenting so i can find this later cuz me saving videos has become unreliable for some reason and doesnt get saved in my favorites
did anyone else see the thumbnail as a girl with her legs spread and over her head
my soul has been cleansed thanks you smol boi i love puffer fish
i once saw a flounder that small was adorable even with its stupid little eyes on one side
dinner nah had one in my aquarium years ago used to eat guppies hand fed
i had a couple puffer fish they were like dogs so interactive and very smart i had a timer that would dim turn off the light in their tank to simulate nighttime sometimes if they weren‚Äôt hiding i‚Äôd catch them bobbing up and down in one spot asleep as soon as i turned on the lights they would blink a couple times squeeze their eyes shut turn around and slowly swim to the nearest rock or plant to hide under like a discombobulated child marching off to bed feeding them was pretty cool too i would drop their food into the water and at first they would nibble at it as it sank but as soon as it hit the floor they wouldn‚Äôt touch it so one day i put a cube of brined shrimp in the palm of my hands and put both my hands in the water like op‚Äôs picture they swam into my hands and ate the shrimp funny little fish
oh my god i love this‚ù§Ô∏è wish people could do this just get along
i for one would not have the courage to as cats do put my arse in front of a rhino s face
pretty sure that cat almost lost it s head up a nostril at one point there
i wish i could have had my dogs when they were puppies i have two gsds but i adopted them as adults even though i missed out on these cute moments it s okay because at least they have a loving home now and there s always the internet where i can live vicariously thanks for sharing op even though i m sure this isn t oc
going to save this and show it to my friends when they re feeling down
german shepherd puppies are the cutest and they‚Äôre amazing dogs when they grow up i‚Äôve never felt so safe in my life
looks like a picture that would be on a pokemon card
roses are red i like to bounce when time is right i silly pounce
very excited with just the right amount of aieeeeeeee
this is in the netherlands right this garden has dutch all over it
you know what that is fucking cool what beautiful doggie
them ears üòÅ my malamute fluff ball had them as well look ridiculously cartoon like and sooo cute
you cant look at this picture and not smile inside its impossible
also they‚Äôre the best companions too i have two and i wouldn‚Äôt trade them in for the world
why is this corgi trying to camouflage as a german shepherd
it took me almost minutes to understand what the hell i m looking at
picture looked familiar as i was scrolling down dont know how it ended up here but i know for a fact that it s my cousins dog
i m completely owned by cats and i have to admit i haven t seen a cat pic as awesome as this doggo paws up
oh my god this just made my entire week thank you for this
that s the stage where their ears are still floppy there s a middle stage where one ear is up an one is flop it s too much to look directly at
good thing i don‚Äôt need a heart because mine just exploded
this looks like a photoreal version of a hypothetical pixar character i d go see it
this is a repost i ve seen it before credit to u inmyelement
i look at this happy puppy and that old song from childhood church free babysitting for my parents is immediately in my head he s got the joy joy joy joy down in his heart that is one gloriously happy furry being it is a great photograph
super dog my cat is in defense mode while staring at this pic lmao
like ever hoooo boy do i have some pictures to show you
i thought the ears was the neck and you had a dog with a neck the size of a snake
it definitely ain‚Äôt bad but best picture you‚Äôve ever seen üëÄ
really the best of all time like in your whole life
wow the sonic the hedgehog team really turned it around with the redesign
i guess buddhist monks self immolating to protest the south vietnamese governments violent repression of their religion doesn‚Äôt move you eh white people and their dogs man
i saw this yesterday and forgot to save it i mentioned it to someone and couldn‚Äôt find it spent minutes being like ‚Äúhold on this is the perfect picture for whatever our conversation was about ‚Äù thankfully they also thought it was worth the wait
i don t know about you guys but i especially enjoyed the part where the bird flew into his hand
how the hell do you even tame a cardinal buggers are super cautious
he really contemplated life for a bit there before taking the nut
"that slo mo is messing with my head üòÇ
fabulous footage though"
love the precision and adjustment the bird does in the air so calculated
that was beautiful we don t have them in california or fireflies what the hell is wrong with this place
pretty but noisy at like a m and earlier until the solstice and beyond love them for their beauty but boy do i hate em in da mornin
one of the best slo mo vids of a bird i‚Äôve ever seen love how he tucks during flight
cat i hope you re not posting it on soci ooh you will regret this hooman mumbles in cat
this is the type of pic that will get linked when this guy finally gets arrested as a serial killer
a cat in a towel turban wins the internet for cuteness
bwahahahaha he looks thrilled love the hair bun for him
i thought this a new lewis capaldi instagram story for split second
you have no idea how happy it made me that i‚Äôm not the only dude that wears his towel up to his chest i‚Äôve been made fun of by every girl i‚Äôve ever dated
who wear apple watch in bathroom ouch look at those fingers of the cat
off topic please add a ‚Äúroastme‚Äù signe post there thanks
what brand of cat is that i need a hairless one since im allergic
all those towels and you re still showing your puss
he s using his cat to get karma goddam people on reddit are assholes
first of all who takes a shower with their apple watch
that dude is getting murdered while he sleeps ive seen the look in that cats face before
i would never dream of holding my cats with that little claw restraint that close to a source of water i would have more blood than skin
i wonder how long it took for the moms to coordinate this play date
so i ve been wondering this seriously for a while why do other mammal offspring walk within an hour of being born but it takes us so long
i love how the parent donkey is doing the exact same thing as the human parent
c‚Äômon dad free up the boy‚Äôs hands crouch and hold him by the waist for a moment
looks at you looks at the pizza hmmm i think he‚Äôs trying to tell you something
what is it about seeing the white s of a dog s eyes that makes their expressions way funnier
this is considered torture under the geneva convention guidelines and will not be tolerated
using telepathy to try to levitate pizza slice in direction of snoot
ill say it i hate begging dogs show some boundaries my dog knows to wait in the other room while we eat dinner after dinner ill take the doggo friendly food bits and put them in his dish he knows that only food in his dish is doggo food
i m assuming the purpleish veggies i see there are red onions if that is the case please don t give your dog this pizza onions are very bad for dogs and cats
do you know what kind of mix yours is my friend has a dog that looks extremely similar to yours
mine starts doing flips and knocking shit over out of excitement if i even look at his bowl
my dogs loved pizza and always got some when i had it i came home from work one night with a carryout pepperoni one of the dogs was so excited he burst right through the closed screen door the moment i opened the sliding glass door he was properly ashamed of himself but he got a piece anyway
puts me in mind of my family s dog except ours is dying going by blood tests and no improvement with medication so i m just sad sweet lil dog definitely though
love the dog but can‚Äôt stand how hard the puppies paws are being squeezed look at the persons fingernails
how can any culture look at that face and then eat it i used to live in china is why sorry to be a downer
nope for all we know he could‚Äôve been sent here by a demon collecting souls and i‚Äôd offer mine up on a silver platter
it seems like nervous licking his paw is being squeezed
doggo translator here the little furball s lick says let me go please i must eat that shoe now k thanks bye
new i can t resist dat my little sis i m gonna comment dat me
i can‚Äôt fucking handle the cuteness i may need to hide this from my feed
no way i would definitely feed that doggo at the table
fun fact he is in pain since paws cant bend like that dogs especially pups will lick your hands to tell you politely that you re hurting them
yes i have a adorable dog and i have to say no to her every day
apparently you couldn‚Äôt resist the repost either lol
he could tell me to amputate my own arm and i would do it with a smile on my face
omg what is that thing its piercing my magic immunity
this looks like my monkey long coated retriever as a little pupperino melts my world
the fact that i can t lavish this bundle of hair with pets makes me irrationally angry
whoa i m stunned it s like night sky with the whole body and one little source of light that cute little pink tongue
i probably could not but i will never know because i would not try to resist
it‚Äôs a repost but i love it so much i‚Äôll upvote it again
i mean greg is and timmothy over there is pretty cute but i am not a fan of charlotte anthony spidericus kevin or that little snot yorvit
i think one or two would be cute but a bunch of bugs in a group like that always creep me out
no they are what nightmares are made of nuke the whole region
ok i get why you posted this but i think a general majority are creeped out good idea bad execution
those potatoes have to be a few weeks old they don t look enough like mole rats
i don‚Äôt think i‚Äôve ever experienced such jealousy as i am feeling right now
a really good friend of mines parents breed golden retrievers and i get to do this all the time
please spay and neuter pups are cute but it s just not responsible unless you re a legitimate breeder
u imnot pj who s jealous i m not jealous you are jealous cri hard
where are the puppies all i see is a giant cuddly pillow
there is actually a sole black lab in the pic find it guys
omg i love the lone black one my dog is half golden retriever half german shepherd and that‚Äôs what he looked like as a puppy
she put all the ink into the first pup leaving no ink for the rest
please spay and neuter your pets while your newborn pets are cute failing to do this allows your little darlings to add to the population of homeless animals adopt pets from your local animal rescues shelters there are plenty of animals just waiting for a home
is your mother a dog breeder if she isn‚Äôt when will she spay and neuter the dogs
my mom‚Äôs dog is a goldendoodle and bred with a poodle the dog will be spayed after and all of the pups already have homes waiting
i m sure your mom s dog didn t feel this way it s painful as hell anyone who puts a dog through that and gloats is an asshole
statistically one of those pups is going to pee on your chest
i honestly didn‚Äôt notice that one black dog at first
just for the record that s possibly the ugliest throw pillow i ve seen in my life
being buried under a mountain of puppies is on my bucket list
your mother must have had an awful time giving birth to that many pups
so are you taking signups for people who want to snuggle with puppies cuz i will gladly pay for a session
stop breeding millions of innocent and healthy animals are killed each year
i had a dream last night that i found a fluffy kitten similar to this his mom was a seagull though and she kept them in a nest she built inside the tire of an aston martin so irdk i named him archimedes and i think that is such a stellar name for a cat also because the kitten in my dream was technically half bird though he showed so signs of it
percocet xanex oxy why because they all make you feel good
do not feed it no matter how much it wants that ice cream
what type of dog is she my girl looks exactly like her
sorry what chocolate chip is probably the lamest possible ice cream flavor it s like some cruel monster took the old classic chocolate chip cookie dough and simply robbed you of all the cookie dough don t get me wrong i ve seen worse flavors like green tea but why would anyone prefer chocolate chip
that looks like cookies and cream not chocolate chips
you get a boop and you get a boop and you get a boop
‚Äúyou have a wet nose i have a wet nose you have a waggly tail i have a waggly tail ‚Äù
it could be a mix but i see some great pyrenees in there the fact they guard livestock makes them next level cute you have not been loved until a dog identifies you as part of their herd
i love how curious cows are and how they interact with the pupper
this is so pure i had a really hard day and needed this adorableness thanks for the post
its so cute all the videos of cows fascinated with dogs they are always so curious of their new little friends
the muscle relaxer i took is kicking in amp i read ‚Äúbunny poops all over the cows‚Äù
his boop brings all the cows to the yard and damn right it‚Äôs better than yours
the cows are like ‚Äúawww look at the cute puppy‚Äù and then they all proceed to come lol
this is a repost move along folks just someone taking advantage of other redditors hard work
"fucking kill that thing now that s horrific
üòñüò£üò°üò°üò°
why tf does this post even have upvotes üëéüëéüëéüòñüòñüòñüòñüòñüòñüòñüò£üò£üò®üò°üò°üò°"
i like to think that since the pup got adopted the cows have banded together to be his new moms
what a great doggo personality making friends wherever she go
love the cow in the back who got up with excitement
did u kno the number one killer of dogs in america are cows
that pup is going to fly away if he doesn‚Äôt control his tail
omgosh who u am pupper boop boop omgosh who u am pupper boop boop omgosh who u am pupper boop boop omgosh who u am pupper boop boop
aww that cow was so excited jumped right up to receive his own boop
cows are so cute its sad to think they re just meat puppies to us
ha i thought it said poop i watched it twice thinking i missed it
yes greetings larger doggos hello hello hello hello
lmao those tags on their ears make them look like grocery products
that cow stood up like most people over when they see a puppy
that tail is beyond physics perpetual motion has been achieved
what is with the ridiculous sped up videos these days other times this has been posted it had normal speed and the instagram source is normal speed and has sound
wtf is this torture why is this gif only like s long why are you stopping right when i was about to smile i need more give me more i demand more
this is so sad when you see the freedom the dog has and you see the cows i wish they both got the same treatment in life
it s like a bunch of diva moms getting awestruck by this shyly confident child sayin hello
everyone looks very excited and this makes me very happy
it s almost like they re living things with their own personalities
does anyone know what those yellow tags on the cows ears mean
you get a boop and you get a boop you want a boop you got one fren
i wonder if they think ow cool finally someone to guard us against wolves
those eartags means they are going to be slaughtered
how exactly does the mating of a weiner dog and a golden look seems like that would be a sight
i love gold so much that i lost my pupper in an unfortunate smelting accident
i feel like this should become a breed it s basically a better looking wiener
arthur s a beautiful and awesome cat you re super lucky that he decided to designate you as his main hooooman for the past years
is this arthur the same arthur who has his own iron throne now
pls give arthur many chin scratches and forehead kisses from ouija
arthur our poodle terrier mix lasted til rip arthur never ceased being a puppy
and on that day the ancient rays of an old sun shone on the light of a new life what we are and what we become are the same a reflection of eternal light
ah what a beautiful cat give him a good cuddle for me
i had a cat that looked just like him when i was a kid this made my day
damn arthur is super photogenic he seems like a hollywood model
cute now when he grows up though he can eat a watermelon like a grape
are adult hippos raised in captivity less aggressive than wild hippos having a guard hippo would be dope
it‚Äôs nuts that these things grow up to be murder machines
so baby hippos are basically puppies loving cute obese little puppies i wonder how dangerous ones around this size are what s its crunching power
i do this to my cat but to his feet so he doesn t freak out when i trim his toe nails
why did evolution make baby murder machines so adorable
what is the bite strength of a hippo even a baby she is a professional of course and has a bond with this hippo but how much danger is she actually in anyone know
where can i apply for the position of baby hippo dentist
do other animals have teething pain as well or is it becaues humans come out so underdeveloped
i never expected the inside of a baby hippo s mouth to be so damn cute
yay thank you for posting the happy ending of him getting his toy back üòç
real ones know that is a reindeer webkin with its antlers bitten off
i love how in true adolescent form he then smashes it into his sibling‚Äôs face
keep those videos coming i want a dog and my girlfriends loves leo this might add to my cause

we had a golden who loved his stuffies we always bought him mini pillow pets he would carry his stuffed toy around for about months and then one day destroy it once the filling started spilling we‚Äôd replace the toy with a new one
the happiest pup i have ever seen love love this pic üòÜü§©
he is just genuinely loving all the dedicated love and special attention
your dog s claws are too long please have this taken care of
i feel like there could be so many memes made from this
if he had a monocle he would be a new meme called monopoly cat
i know where i m supposed to look but the arrow is appreciated
looks like he‚Äôd be some sort of bavarian mountain man or musketeer
there is cat that looks a lot like this he‚Äôs called hamilton the hipster cat
when you hit random on the kajiit character creator
omg i want this cat he would go great with my husband
all of a sudden i have an urge to play cat monopoly
perfect wallpaper is there a version with higher resolution
would you consider giving permission to use this image in a painting or pamphlet
his nose looks like football grain which is pig skin kinda makes sense just an observation though
he looked like some kind of alien frog to me then my mind solved the puzzle and he is adorable
did the trampoline thing and double booped quickly many times so it looked like i was bouncing on the giant snout and it made me happy
i thought this was a hippo rising out of some algae for a sec
this is cute but from where i m from melt means something completely different hahaha
wow it looks like a beautiful morning outside your window
be careful the slightest noise could shock and kill them
i love bunnies i wish they were more common as pets i guess it can be difficult because they re really shy

oh my gosh what a sweet baby i loooove this little face so much üò≠üíú
please give her a good pat from me she‚Äôs a beautiful lady ‚ù£Ô∏è
how beautiful today i got some rough news regarding my health and seeing her go through this and still be so happy gave me so much hope give her many kisses for me ü•∞
i feel like i need a background story here she‚Äôs adorable by the way i want to give her many kisses
more an oww than an aww but hey life is tough for both toddlers and fishes
this is the definition of priceless don t forget to put this in her senior year of hs yearbook
i love the shoes i love the face and i love this photo
this is glorious totally frame this in a high traffic area in your home üòÇ
thank you so much for sharing a memory that will be with you for a long time adorable
if you still have the fish get it taxidermied my grandpa did this for me and my first fish and it s such a fun memory and good story every time someone asks why i have a stuffed tiny sunfish on my wall after i caught it with my mickey mouse fishing pole no less i freaked out and threw my entire pole into the water and ran to the car my grandpa retrieved it out of the water and had his girlfriend s son taxidermy the fish üòÇ it s my favorite keepsake
great photo i wonder how she will feel about eating fish after that
ah yes the good days i caught a baby catfish one time
this is such a great picture she reminds me of my daughter my daughter is and begs me to take her fishing all the time she also has that exact same shirt and shoes your daughter is wearing
hey man sunnies can be pretty sharp my own childhood was filled with ones just like that i hope she grows up happy and healthy to cherish these times too
good job i‚Äôve fished since i was little a lot of good memories
‚Äúlemme teach you a little lesson about what life will do to ya when you think you‚Äôre winning kid ‚Äù ‚Äîsassy fish
is she going to eat the fish or are you teaching her that it is ok to harm animals for entertainment purposes only
for whatever reason this made me laugh i hope she keeps fishing for a long long time
this is such an amazing photo great catch for multiple reasons
getting smacked in the face by a slimy squirmy thing is good practice for the real world welcome to life little girl
can we not have fishing and hunting photos on a subreddit where we come to look at cute animals being happy
this is adorable perfect timing when i caught my first fish i got so excited that i dropped my pole so i could pull the fishing line in by hand i remember thinking it was faster and i was just so excited to see my fishy i somehow managed to knock loose the hook in the fish s mouth when i grabbed it and the hook went in the flesh of my finger tip and came out the other side i don t remember any pain aside from the application of mercurochrome later on but seeing the hook looped through my finger was terrible i don t know what we did with the poor fish but it was certainly a memorable experience
i got smacked in the face by an oyster around that age not just any oyster but a hot oyster apparently when you grill them they can get a little jumpy and one of them flew right off the grill and whacked me on the head i ate it in revenge all you parents out there with picky kids just get the food you want them to eat to attack them and then it s a matter of pride
when you cast the line in and get more than you bargained for
looking across the room at a pic of yo me very similar looking to your daughter hence the nostalgia proudly holding one of my first brim in one hand and holding dad‚Äôs hand with the other fishing was our thing
give me back that filet o fish give me that fish give me back that filet o fish give me that fish what if it was you hangin on this line if it was you bein reeled you wouldn‚Äôt be so sang u ine
teaching your daughter to be a killer as well i see this isn t a happy picture imagine the pain the fish is feeling
you re going to carp on about it for the rest of her childhood right lol
when i was a young warthog my father bought us some old fashioned fishing rods i‚Äôm talking the ones that are literally just a long stick and an even longer string attached to the end the first day we took them out for a spin on our pond in the back yard and i was way hype cause i was determined to catch a blue gill that day lo and behold i did i snapped up the line and realized i didn‚Äôt know how i was supposed to get the fish out of the water cause no reel so my dads hollering and telling me to yank it out of the water and i panicked and yanked it waaaay harder than it needed and then i panicked more because a fucking fish was zooming at mach out of the water towards my year old face and then i ran as fast as i could but i still held onto that pole so that fucking fish was flying around the yard chasing me through the sky good times
great now this poor fish s worst moment is immortalized on the internet
so karen please tell me again why the red dot went away
i love the little doggie stretch and squeeze at the end and the kitty s satisfied look on her face
this looks like a good spot to found a new city press ‚Äòb‚Äô to find a new city here
its farina the cat who is seemingly attached to brown husky as a bed
and of course the butt has to be pointed towards the dog s face classic cat move
i want my cat to do that with my future pup for now he does that to me when i lay down in bed for the night
i can h e a r the cats purrs from just looking at this lmao
mmm these self heating cat beds are premium quality but need a self cleaning upgrade
u amountainbound seems about right for some body pillow naps
hmmmmm reminds me of rocky road ice cream with dark chocolate instead of milk chocolate roxy i don t know its gender so i m drawing blanks
my cousin mose named his cat ‚Äúgarbage‚Äù because he liked to eat garbage

actually how common therapy dogs are they seem to pop here every other day
how do you train them to do this my golden puppy would just knock kids over in her enthusiasm
that vest is fake i have a therapy dog and this is not how it works whoever the owner is should be ashamed
letting your therapy dog in training run up to any person and start licking them is not training at all there s a person being that leash letting this behavior happen
as a stoic alpha male this gives a warmness in my chest cavity i am complete
hey kid put in a good word with me with the humans okay smooch
smoochy win means therapy fail subject is too much of a good boy
obviously there is training involved but i almost feel like golden s are natural therapy dogs they just seem to get it
lick her right on her soft cheek xd god i want a golden retriever in my life
you aren‚Äôt supposed to draw it better than the original artist but you did
that s awesome i dont know a damn thing about pokemon but he is so cute in this movie i m gonna have to see it
is this actually real i m seeing the movie tomorrow and you re just making me more excited d
looks awesome need a time lapse video so we can see start to finish ps we have the watercolor of our boxer you did hanging in our living room
that is amazing i don‚Äôt know much about pok√©mon i do enjoy it tho please do more drawings
with art being drawn in it s whole i ve always wondered how do you specifically see the image before you start to draw if not does it slightly come together particle by particle and slowly gain a perspective image on the idea or do you see the picture on the paper before you start to draw and have a mental image of it and just lightly speaking trace the picture your mind portrays onto the paper i am far from being a person to portray a picture on a surface via drawing or anything but i can see stuff in my mind that i want to draw yet when tried to trace from the image in my mind it literally never comes out right dont get me wrong though i can draw a beautiful stick figure person and a happy sunshine on the corner of the paper lol
congrats on finishing the drawing i saw the original post when you started and it now looks even better than i expected
do you do any commissions would love to purchase an evolutionary line
aren t you annoyed when some people erase part of the painting so they can show how it s just finished s
i ve never understood how people can get coloured pencils to blend so well maybe i m not using the kind
i watched this for seconds before realizing it was a second gif
but how you gone convince the studio you didn‚Äôt rip a frame of their movie üßê seriously epic work
i always think i want a real life pikachu and then i remember i have cats and a dog and that pets literally are real life pokemon lmao anyways your drawing looks so realistic very well done
remind me of that scene from jaws where he‚Äôs like ‚Äúblack eyes like a dolls eyes‚Äù lol amazing drawing
eyyyyyyyo i saw your progress pic and was wondering when you would complete it didn t take long smh i m amazed at your talent and hard work this would take someone else years to complete i cant imagine the time you have put in to this but it has payed off keep it up
wow it looks great and pikachu looks adorable you are very talented
i love this so much that i want to actually have a framed print of this i don‚Äôt even have framed pictures of family i‚Äôd seriously have to for this
hours have passed and you are still putting on the finishing touches
this must have taken forever to draw i watched the video for an hour and the artist was still coloring the same spot on pikachu‚Äôs arm
i wish i can draw like you do pikachu is my favorite pokemon
spending an awful lot of time on that last bit aren‚Äôt you
it may just be me but the way the hair flows from the tail feels a little off still an amazing drawing though
this makes me wonder why i bother ever picking up a pencil to begin with
showed my year old this he said he thinks pikachu is ‚Äúthe cutest‚Äù this is amazing
he s so lifelike o his little peepers are so cute it hurts
i ve been waiting for this for what feels like forever but i have a question how do you know when you re done like it looks great but do you ever get the urge to go back and add just one more line or anything
i look at drawings like this and just think how i can t fathom how anyone can be this talented and creative damn fine work
i remember your original wip post looks even better than i could have imagined good job
detective pikachu is very sexy almost like a fat cat
this is amazing i checked out your other work on your profile your very talented
the eyes are creepy the way they stare into my soul well done artwork though
seriously that is insanely and i mean insanely fantastic if youre not already you need to so something with art if its just a past time hobby for you then definitely you need to get linked with some peeps are characters like this your thing or can you draw whatever basically anime studios could use you if you can do realistic stuff then a studio who wants to give berserk a decent adaptation finally should call you
i know you must have gotten asked about this a lot but approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this
awesome job dude saw the earlier post when it was just his head looks great
for a moment there i thought you were drawing on a glass pane or similar transparent flat surface
so many mixed emotions that‚Äôs amazing but i feel so much hate that you can do that but i love you
pretty awesome but for some reason i see chuckie from the new childs play movie
ok full disclosure i m not even vaguely into the whole pok√©mon thing but i want to pat this pikachu
to pick up chicks don‚Äôt bring your dog bring this ‚Äúadorable‚Äù
when you post the unfinished version and the finished version for double the karma
predictions for his inbox amp x b i ll give you for it mate it s not even that big my friend could do that you re scamming me i m reporting you to the pikachu forum admins blocked
do you have a youtube account where you post the full length video of your drawing sessions
my favorite part of detective pikachu is seeing the art style inspire so many artists
had to double check if this wasn t the actual original poster who did the wip and so glad to see its actually them awesome work on it
honestly seeing stuff like this makes me want to give up on art in general it‚Äôs amazing and i can‚Äôt help but compare myself to stuff like this
imagine just going back like years and showing what is possible in art
i love this it‚Äôs so expressive and vibrant nice job
this is so cute op i saw the movie over the weekend and i was surprised all around the movie was cute and fun and the people in the theater teens to s were well behaved not one cell phone went off and no one loudly talked to each other not a spoiler but when the loudreds made their appearance it was sooo adorable and the whole place was a mixture of awwws and laughter
shouldn t pikachu s fur always be standing upright like he was rubbed with a balloon from his constant static charge just something i never thought about
my brain has never been able to grasp how to get fur or hair so perfect like this crazy skills
shhhhhhhhhhhhhiiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeeeeeetttttt awwwwwww
my naive child like mind half expected him to remove the drawing to show a real pikachu behind it or him drawing on the pikachu like people do with dogs sometimes
seriously came in here to say fuck you for your talent but it s already every other post
this really help me figure out pikachu‚Äôs fur directions thank you
how to prove you ve drawn something make a video of you drawing over already existing lines
i wish my drawing skill could be as good as you do good job
i hate talented skilled people they make me feel small
i thought you were just petting pikachu with a pencil
what‚Äôs it like to be this talented like did you used to be shitty and you just practiced a ton or are you just naturally gifted
why do a gif of just a random hand doing nothing on this lovely pic could be anyone doing anything haha could we not have the entire star to finish please
when i said you would only draw half for the karma what i actually meant was your an amazing artist who deserves every up vote
reddit hasn t failed to disappoint these days people reposting stuff that are a month old and making it to the front page
you pet pikachu with colors until pikachu manifested
that looks incredible are you going to post the picture once it s done
so jealous that you‚Äôre this talented keep it up tho
this looks fake dont get me wrong it s just too good to be true
the movie pikachu is so damn ugly tho feels more like defective pikachu
you can t fool me obviously you took a picture and are just lightly touching a colored pencil to it to make it look like you colored it for real though that s amazing skill way to go
it was so good i went to the comments to see if you actually made this lol
can i have he is so cute i just want to pinch and bite him
the drawing is good but why the video of you pretending to draw on it couldn t you just take a picture of the drawing
paramount pictures thinks your drawing looks too much like pikachu it will never be succesfull
"wow
unfortunately i m more autistic than artistic üòï"
it s like the movies where you see the actor filling in nothing lol great work tho looks awesome
just looked at ur profile and u have been doing this for days it looks amazing
i hate you for being so talented that s absolutely incredible
you re hired i didn t know i was applying for anything you re hired
now we need some vfx artists to make this come to life out of the drawing
fake that s a real pikachu that you just trained to lie down while you stroked it with a pencil
when i see art like this it makes me want to learn to draw amazing work
wow this is so nicely rendered what kind of paper are you using
this is good but i d be lying if i didn t say that this new depiction of pikachu feels very contradictory to what i grew up with not your fault though
i wish i could draw half as good as this this is beautiful
ughh this is so good that i‚Äôm so mad at you that is it so good
my friend went to see it she said there was basically only children going to see it that s about what i would have expected
draw everywhere on everything and make it all furry
i am always amazed how many great artists there are on the internet
it s really good but i m not sure it belongs on this sub
this is epic how long did it take for you to make this
holy crap i wasn t a believer but i think i found my god
that‚Äôs some awesome work outstanding attention to detail
my literal reaction when i saw this was whaa anyway you are an excellent artist
i bet your year old niece did this and you just draw a few lines in the end to collect the sweet karma
the way you capture the highlights is damn near flawless serious skills you got there
im just a bit creeped out at the reflection in pikachus eyes just a bit
i mean i know its yours but it looks like one of those minecraft memes where you replace a few blocks to make it look like you made it
really milking it it s good an all but multiple posts for the same thing
you should really stop colouring in his left arm or it ll be too yellow
this is amazing looks like he s gonna jump right off the page any minute wish i could draw just half as good as this lol i would be happy with that
does anyone else want to see the full length video of the artist drawing it from scratch i m in awe of how good it is and i watch it all day
cuter and better than the cgi version these hollywood studios should have hired you
how come this looks more like pikachu than pikachu does
ok so this is not just a drawing this is something more i cannot interpret my emotions yet i want to spread the word about this drawing like an evangelist
please for the love of god tell me there is a place where i can order a high res scan and print of this i need it
is it just me or does anyone else hate detective pikachu s voice
amazing picture also i m lefty and for a second was like wtf how you draw dems so good wit yo wrong hand
my mind can t comprehend how does one paint with such detail
hey kid wanna be stroked by a pikachu would be cool right
this realistic drawing telling us how realistic you are
i ve watched enough tv to spot when someone just does some strokes on finished work
i just realized how long arms pikachu have i‚Äôve always thought they were rather short that or the design of him has changed a lot
gawd damn and i have a hard time coloring inside the lines a prophet of colored pencils
this is great some awesome talent on show here however i m not a fan of these short vids that demosntrate nothing other than yeah this was me drawing it i can understand timelapses and stuff showing the process of creation but i ve seen loads of things similar to this where the artist records themselves putting the last stroke of the brush or pencil and i don t get the trend
so realistic i honestly expected it to start yelling at me about how i should get off my computer and do something productive
you‚Äôre absolutely insanely talented i hope you work as an illustrator because your skills are beyond
your drawing is amazing but the actual detective pikachu is ugly af
why do these posts always show the person ‚Äúdrawing‚Äù on the clearly finished art lol to show proof that they drew it or what
as much as my family says detective pikachu isn‚Äôt cute i‚Äôll always know that he is the cutest thing for the world to ever see
i m calling b s i mean i m sorry but that just looks so good you couldn t have done itnwith just colour pencils
in my opinion i have just died becouse those eyes just burned thrue my soul into my head and melted my brain so can the eyes chill the fuck out
i saw your first post i m happy to see it completed
oh hey it s the guy who always makes sure he has a colored pencil in his picture
hey i reposted to bossfight xd and got upvotes check it out if u want also nice drawing üëç
this is definitely one of the best drawings i have ever had the pleasure of seeing
spoiler on the movie the female protag gets tounged by a greninja
looks like you spent more time working on this than the writers spent on the movie
i swear if i touch those furs i can feel it‚Äôs fluffy
this sketch is so well done it reminds me of how the movie pikachu is not cute but creepy
this is cuter than the animation great job my friend
i still say that danny devito should voice eggman in the sonic movie we were too late for this boi
did you happen to sell your soul for drawing skills
it‚Äôs wonderful but considering how long it‚Äôs taking to draw that one hair the whole picture would take months and months lol
this is really funny if you zoom in to just the face
his name is miles taylor i follow him on instagram i think he goes by smiles taylor
love this it‚Äôs pretty awesome seeing this kind of enthusiasm on a side note i can‚Äôt wait until the nebuchadnezzar style beard goes out of style
i love see this kind of post it brings me so much joy great to see such passion
this kid makes me want to work harder at being better
i liked how he let him finish on his own it‚Äôs about over coming the struggle that makes succeeding feel so freaking good
this brought a tear to my eye excuse me while i burn something to feel like a man again
as a nurse who takes care of a lot kids with cerebral palsy this post got me misty eyed this is wonderful üòä
he is somehow horribly off balance yet completely balanced at the same time it looks like he s going to fall over but he appears to be totally in control
question so i‚Äôve seen a lot of these videos aren‚Äôt why potentially dangerous given spine and balance issues with most cerebral palsy patients
yo mass respect to this dude doing that despite having cp and i know how heavy these fuckers are that‚Äôs what makes this even more impressive respect to all those who have mental or physical disabilities or disorders you have it worse than the rest of us yet you still soldier on
i don‚Äôt have cerebral palsy and can‚Äôt do that he‚Äôs so good
the avengers theme crescendo played in my head as he pushed it over the top way to go miles keep it up
this crossfit bullshit needs to stop that was horrible for his back
i don‚Äôt understand this sport can someone elaborate
i m just worried that he lift it up with his back you could yort yourself bro
this made my day and i hope it made someone else‚Äôs as well
i hope that he didn t break his back lifting like this
eli why are cp people all twitchy and goofy when they move but otherwise have somewhat normal strength in my experiences including this single video and my friends dad lol
this is not a good place for this to be posted it s absolutely abhorrent this isn t a cute animal doing tricks nor is it a painting elephant this is a guy accomplishing something extraordinary this isn t an aww look at him go moment i m sorry but this is just appalling
you forgot the best part he also easily set the world deadlift record for his weight class
i don t know if this is the safest thing for someone who can t keep solid form i guess he s working with professionals though what do i know
that celebration overhand right might just kill a man
not gonna lie that boy is a beast not only did he do that better than most people can do hes stronger in mind than the guys who go there daily well fucking done i had a sweat on watching this tbh
wtf wrong sub lol this is cool but one thing it is not is cute
could have gone really badly but it didn‚Äôt and the payoff is huge sometimes you just gotta let life happen
when you love your job you never have to work a day in your life this man loves his job major props to them both
i am not the type to recognize feelings like this often but this is absolutely th best tear jerking awesomenessnessnessness ive seen in a while i ll bet this made some news but i definitely dont see enough stuff like this on the newses i watch and that s why i can never delete you reddit no matter how many times i get mad and say its over between us i know deep down it can never be over between us because we are we are the youth of the nation
fuck that s great you can see how difficult that was for him but his persistence really paid of for him
right when i m having a bad day something wholesome pops up on reddit this made my day
celebrated a little early don‚Äôt want that rolling back off onto your toe
that did everything for that boys self esteem come on
probably one of the few posts that put a real smile on my face
this makes me so happy it also makes me realize that i as an able bodied person could probably only successfully do that with something a third that weight i‚Äôm so pathetic
everyone is pointing out how it may hurt his back how is everyone missing him turning his ankle degrees and roll his ankle at the last push
question about palsy folks and heavy lifting is the erratic movement dangerous or risky to their muscles like i feel like sudden strenuous movement would pull something or possibly tear something anyone have any info on that
you know what‚Äôs even more impressive the way he handled being left hanging the first time that was smooth
ohhhhh man i clicked away at just the wrong moment so it looked like he went for a high five and was left hanging had to come back and watch it again
i need to not watch these videos after doing my eye makeup
i think that looking beyond his physical problems succeeding in lifting an atlas stone is an achievement and it gives him joy and a sense of achievement his trainer is right there all the time and knows him better than any of us just watching a gif well done dude keep it up
not aww and seriously unsafe for the guy back injuries are no joke and we shouldn t promote this type of lifting for these type of people
i surely didn t anticipate tears before i went to bed dammit
isn t aww a bit patronising maximum respect is more fitting
i love watching miles doin this stuff the man has more heart then prolly all of us lol good job
that is miles and uncle nic go follow both of them they re truly an inspiration
oh for fuck sake i know i sound like a broken record every time someone with a disability and a mad talent is in aww but stop being so god damn patronising it‚Äôs not aww it‚Äôs awesome
fuck i was super scared for the guy the entire time though seeing there wasn t a nsfw tag made it somewhat of a relief
as another person with cerebral palsy that s impressive but have you seen how fast i can eat a chocolate cake that s made for two by myself now that s a real feat of strength
if it didn t stop in the hole it doesn t count s please realise that this is a joke reddit
i know some people will think it s bad that this is aww worthy as hes a human and no different because of his condition but holy crap his videos make me shed man tears not just because hes so happy but everyone else around him that are so supportive and give him the time and energy i think hes an inspiration to able bodied people let alone disabled
"omg that made my heart so warm and happy
‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
it just proves any can do anything"
holy frap he s going into strongman lifts o atlas stones are no joke and this motivates me
i m super happy for him but lack of proper posture is super dangerous s he could get really hurt
looks like brian alsrhue s gym he s a great guy check out his youtube channel for all sorts of great weightlifting strongman vids
this made me smile and my vision kinda blurry always amazing to see these people achieve more than i do o
good for him of course but that looked so dangerous and could ve easily led to severe injury if he dropped the stone
aww means different things to different people i see
i was waiting for the ball to cones back and crashs him
i only noticed the part where his first high five was ignored am i going to hell for that
i am honestly impressed i couldn t lift a stone this big really amp x b shouldn t we healthy people be more thankful for everything and do greater better things with what we have
i‚Äôm no robot i‚Äôm a man i can pick all the photos containing a traffic cone or a car so there i‚Äôm always amazed at how everyone thinks this is a miracle the human body is an amazing machine even his even with his challenges but instead of accomplishments and feats and tests we tinder drake and bust down tat if we all just poured our efforts into our families our friends god and our physical health i don‚Äôt know it just seem like a hollow world so happy for this kid and his coach i‚Äôm blessed so have seen another beautiful sunrise this morning that i didn‚Äôt deserve have a great day every one
the sense of accomplishment radiating off that kid jesus
i need that sweet bearded man to coach me through my entire life
every time i see someone with cerebral palsy i think of joshthedoodle and it‚Äôs freaking adorable
im gonna need some steel toed boots if i were to try this
i could watch that over and over and still will get butterflies
i have cp this seems both dangerous and inspiration porn nothing to be gained from the desire to physically strain yourself
this was the most wholesome thing i ve seen in a while üíô
the amount of people going out of their way to get butthurt is kind of pathetic personally i didn‚Äôt think anything condescending about the dude or his condition i thought it was a heart felt moment between the coach and the guy lifting the emotion between them was aww not the dude being disabled pull the stick out of your asses jeez
i m pretty sure i ve never been as happy as that kid or his dad about anything i ve seen or done almost feel jealous
he was in an nfl draft announcement for the ravens i think i love him so much he is such a huge inspiration
this is incredible and nearly as incredible is the bond his trainer has with him you can see the genuine emotion on the coaches face
see whats fucked up about this being on this subreddit is there was an original post that fit in beamazed putting it on awww is just demeaning to his achievement he s a fucking champion who regardless of his disability can lift more than most people without a disability he s not a baby or a cute cat he s a guy that can first of all lift more than his body weight which for any lifter is a huge achievement and second can lift more than is body weight while combating muscle spasms and uncontrolled movement dude deserves the respect
love this moment when the guy misses the last high five and gives him two instead
i thought for sure he was about to honk his head at first whew
trainer says take your time lifter says fuck that i m doing this yesterday
i‚Äôve seen other videos of this guy the man next to him obviously cares about him he‚Äôs there as a safety net but also he‚Äôs got his back he‚Äôs been helping him build his strength the joy on both their faces is beautiful
i love miles and everything he does but at the same time considered about his lower back
straight this man ain t even got control of his body and he lifting massive stones i need to get back in the gym
this man wants to be and is a normal human being even saying the celebration is aww is in turn pointing out that it‚Äôs different he jumped up he high fived just like the other man by this logic i could post a video of me doing the exact same celebration and it should be upvoted this post does exactly the opposite of what disabled people would want
this cat holds the secret to unlocking a new universe
this better make it to all i wish i had gold but this is all i got üèÖ
what kind of cat is that i love the leapardy cheetah print
the new live action lisa frank film looks pretty good
i always knew david bowie would ascend to a higher plane of existence
what is making all the rainbow patterns in love with this
omg its actually gold not a pot o gold but a cat with a look worth more than all the gold on earth he she s so beautiful
not gonna lie little disappointed thought there would be a pot of gold i could pay off my student loans with
this needs to get printed on shiny foil and framed for my living room
this should be on some country‚Äôs currency it is seriously beautiful and the holographic aspect would provide security for counterfeit protection just gorgeous
this has to be one of the most fabulous cats i‚Äôve ever seen worthy of lisa frank‚Äôs merchandise
this picture is great i‚Äôm not going to be the one to do it but this would be a great photoshop battle
this is such a joyous moment captured here what a wonderful photo
your happiness just makes the photo what a beautiful moment
i believe that laugh of delight qualifies you for disney princess status
i was pissed with the world until i saw this picture
great pic love the cows but what in god‚Äôs name is in your pockets
we have bucket calves and we call those ‚Äòlove taps‚Äô i sent this to my bf and labeled it ‚Äúpure happiness‚Äù much love
they were trying to get you to let down milk you re now their mother
they‚Äôre all just like ‚Äúlisten to the funny noise he makes when we push his butt ‚Äù i assume you‚Äôre laughing looks like a fun time
pupper peaked early gonna spend his whole life chasing this high
üò¨ keep an eye out to make sure he doesn‚Äôt start hurting himself with it some dogs do that
the desperation when he lost it for a second was too much
this is the greatest moment of his life and mine because i get to see this
at first you think your dog is being silly chasing his tail but then you realize he is biting and gnawing at the area you try to deter him but he goes right back to biting his tail there are several reasons why your dog is biting and chewing at his tail such as impacted anal glands allergies external parasites internal parasites poor hygiene injured tailbone behavior issues if your dog is excessively biting on his tail it may be an indication of a serious condition
he‚Äôs at that age where it‚Äôs physically possible for him to grab his tail
yeah i m gonna have to go ahead and downvote your title there bud
as you can see in my resume that i have caught the tail
wonder how my french bulldog would look doing that they have no tail
i can t say i ve ever seen this happen at the pupper age
you shouldn t allow him to bite it there s a serious diseas with tail biting
remainds me the slag brothers oh boy now i m feeling ancient
if i lived with these tykes i d never get anything done how adorable
these are the dogs that the dad from cloudy with a chance of meatballs would have
i wouldn t have stand it and pet that fluffy belly ü§ó
man i wish we did that here i don‚Äôt wanna touch your nasty flu hand bob
oh we do it kinda similar here in canada but we poop on the floor and then fall asleep licking our own butts
for straight minutes practically guck that ain t nobody got time for that
i‚Äôm planning on getting a dog in the future and want to teach her awesome tricks likes this how does one even begin to teach a dog to do something remotely like this or fetch a beer
this both very sanitary and respectful and cute i never shake peoples hands since i dont know where its been or if they even cleaned it after doing their business
legend has it that they‚Äôre both still bowing to this day
that bow didn t look degrees kind of a dimissive bow i bet some would call it a shit bow
oh ok yr old redditor they haven‚Äôt seen this a times ok i get it
i swear to god if he didn‚Äôt pet this good doggo after
japanese people don t bow like that that is a thai bow know as the wai japanese don t use their hands like that
is this the equivalent of being like heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy theeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrreeeeee
"i don t see electrical outlets like that here in japan
and people have pointed out that the bow is thai so are those thai outlets"
i‚Äôm curious about how so many cultures indian japanese chinese etc came to associate bowing with hands together with respect and greeting so many other aspects of these cultures are way too similar to just be a coincidence
i want the dog and the owner a handsome dog for a handsome fellow
this is from australian japanese dog trainer positivedogcare on instagram btw
americans not knowing the difference between a japanese bow and south east asian greeting smh
i adopted a dog while living in japan he knows how to sit i just have to tell him a dozen times
there s so much love between these two i reckon this is the fourth or fifth time i ve seen this clip and i still love it earnest sweet dogs are the best
obligatory they re australian not japanese for the millionth repost
she must have kissed a prince along the way because i remember leia being much more attractive and less frog like than this
if you give it a kiss you ll have to go to space adventures to save the galaxy from space empires
this shows some amazing love between these two rescuing animals is the way to go and they ll always reciprocate the love they re given
i love when he stretches so carefully to put the snack on top of his person s head ‚ù§
have you ever felt the music so deeply that you had to leave your food on some bald guys head so that you could dance it out
this is very cute but i forgot that birds without feathers looked like that and i was fearful
do d d d d do do do do ddffddddddooooooo ododododdodod
well this is definitely the most enjoyable thing i‚Äôve seen on reddit today
made my morning i‚Äôll keep the food safely on my human xxxx
bahahahaha did he just stash it on my head i m just gunna put dis here
i don‚Äôt even like birds but i will admit this is pretty cute
the parrot is called gucci you can find more videos on instagram if you search for kuterkid the guy mostly posts about vaping and growing weed but there s a few videos of the gucci
does anyone know if the bird s feathers will grow back
it warms my heart so much whenever i see this guy and his birb
i loooooove people who rescue animals and care for them making the world a better place lt
parrot shaved head guy some of the most awful autotune use ever heard in a song
i dont know if he s eating or dancing either but i know hes pooping on your back
at least you don t have to worry about him flying away
that was the best thing i‚Äôve seen today it‚Äôs so cute how he stashed the food to dance
is this the new snapchat filter everyone keeps talking about
i just snorted so hard at this that my gf sleeping in the other room woke up
and the credit for this picture goes to madfluffs on instagram
kitty has her flower crown on for coachella and is definitely on some of those good drugs
need a expectations vs reality side by side with a pic of a cat with bread on its head
this is the perfect image to express the essence of cat
have photographed cats for years must say this photo is about as perfect as it gets
i have never seen a dog so excited about a trampoline
wow i hope to someday be this excited about well anything
clearly a lurcher thing to like trampolines my mum has and they love trampolines too
the world would be a sad place if dogs weren‚Äôt here
i love how this good boi looks around after sitting on his belly p
maybe if i keep my hands within biting distance it‚Äôll be more effective
any scene official who tried to use osha as an excuse not to let the dog onto the ambulance with them is a savage terrible person never ever to be trusted
well unless that guy who s holding the dog is named nothing that bus which knocked his owner might disagree
dog is unconcerned with the consequences of his actions with regards to his own safety comfort and well being his love isn‚Äôt crafty or slick it‚Äôs not cunning or shrewd in fact all things considered it‚Äôs quite childlike dog s love doesn‚Äôt consider dog first it isn‚Äôt selfish or self serving dog doesn‚Äôt wonder what he‚Äôll gain or lose by putting himself on the line he simply puts himself out there on the off chance that you will give him that love in return
hell if i was the owner i would be requesting my service dog be with me on the stretcher the dog is doing his job
nothing will stop op from reposting this with the exact same title
i just teared up while eating my sandwich at work thanks for that
we will never be anywhere close to worthy of our dog‚Äôs live they beat we can do is try really hard every day to pay them back for being the very best people
dog should have attacked that lady too for stealing the poor bastards hat
at first i thought the first guy was the owner and i was pretty confused lol
thats the real medicine right there i bet that dudes pain levels discomfort anxiety fear etc dropped in an instant
sorry but this is a repost don t just expect to get karma by stealing such beautiful posts if you do that you re just a fkn couart
nothing will stop this dog getting reposted every months until the end of time
i like the emt in the bottom right who gives him ‚Äúwtf man all you had to do was hold the dog‚Äù hands
this is so sweet and made me start my day with a cry‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
take care of yourself your dog won t be able to understand what happened to you
oof on a stretcher in traction and he still reaches to comfort his dog well there goes my mascara
my dog weighs like lb if she came to sit on top of me while i was on a stretcher i‚Äôd probably die rip
this reminds me again why i would love to own a dog
g s a my dog typed that so i m gonna assume she loved this video just as much as me lol
aw man i just lost my first dog the other day and this hit waaay too close to home nothing can describe the special bond a dog has with its owner i feel like i lost a part of me
this makes me really sad and really happy at the same time
we don‚Äôt deserve dogs i thank the stars every day for the blessing that we get to have them ‚ù§Ô∏è
actually made me cry i love how animals show their emotions just pure love for his owner
nothing will stop this from being reposted again and again
we should all aspire to be as good as our dogs think we are
great dog i had a german sheppard like that when we entered home from the yard it would accompany each family member in the house people and returned to the next one so they are safely moved in no training for the dog
you have to love nature dogs are potential killing machines with sharp pointy teeth and the emotional maturity of a toddler
that sweet adorable dog that is why i ll give my dogs the best that i can
what a surprise reddit upvoting and supporting poorly trained dogs
probably the th time this has been reposted to this sub
can anyone help me get dog out of his cage in sierra madre the sensor is going off whenever i get close
ah the video took a turn i was prepared for that lady to lose a finger
that‚Äôs definitely a cur mine does this every time i lay on the floor
my nanny passed away at home her dog never left her side when she passed the funeral home came to get her and this is what he did just like the video the men had to leave the room while we got him from on top of her and he was crying the whole time it still breaks my heart to remember it
one more example of why jon snow is an asshole for not petting his damn doggo
i‚Äôm miles away from my little doggo rn haven‚Äôt seen her in almost months this has me crying üò≠
there is this guy and then there that mf aegon targaryen
this has been going around for at least months now did we ever get closure on the story was the guy alright did someone look after puppy while the guy was recovering
you really don t get how much dogs really see you as theirs until someone tries to take them away from you i take my dog to the groomer and she will not walk away from me if i m in her line of vision i walk with her and the groomer to the tub before i leave she s a lb golden retriever and as she was finishing being dried the groomer was crouched down getting her butt fluff and she heard my voice when i walked into the shop and nearly dragged the guy across the floor he was laughing but she was just overjoyed that her person was back dogs are just so good
my dog would do that except he would stomp the crotch when jumping on me
notice how even as he‚Äôs lurching around at the guys hands and has clear opportunities to bite to free itself it still doesn‚Äôt and just wriggles even in there circumstances good good dog stays good dog
my eyes are all blurry is it water or something else
and that my fellow animal lovers is why dogs rule i love them nothing against cats cats are cool
this is cute and all but it s an actual problem for parademics when the dog gets aggressive and starts biting the parademics when they are trying to help the injured
i was at the receiving end when i was young my neighbour s dog was a nightmare for me he chased the f k out of me several times i could never get over my phobia of dogs
we don t deserve dogs look at him deserves all the love in the world they all do
how did this guy get k upvotes when he literally reposted the rd most upvoted post in this subreddit
i need to feel this special relationship between a human and a dog
that dog needs a statue and a subway station named after it like hachiko
fighting back the tears there is something so powerful seeing that kind of love and loyalty
man thanks for making me cry please people if you still have the dog you love go hug them cus you ll never now how good something is until its gone
that‚Äôs so fucking awwwsome try to get me pun patrol
the dogs shows the real love towards is owners thats by there is a quote dog and pets are more honest and intelligents then human beings
make me miss my dog he‚Äôs not dead just at home licking his balls
i cried because i have no one that cares for me as much as this dog cares for its human
i m a hard working burly man do i have permission to cry a few tears from the sheer expression of love this dog has shown for its owner
oh my gosh poor pupper just wants his owner to know he s there for him i sniffled so audibly when the owner grabbed him and held onto him that the guy next to me at starbucks asked if everything is okay
you know it s a good doggo too when he only pretends to bite
i really hope the guy was okay the poor dog would be devastated
op is just a repost bot does nothing but repost look at his comment history
it‚Äôs interesting how every now and then animals do something so unbelievably human that it kind of makes you take a step back
whenever i see things like this i hate my wifes cat even more
they way he just lays on his person and then looks submissively at everyone as if begging not to hurt his person my dog while the softest most harmless being alive would not care rather i don‚Äôt think she would understand she would just appreciate the petting from the random guy and lay on me and lick my face excitedly unaware my body is broken
cheating usually comes with a price tag of some kind look for the signs of cheating‚Äù resist the temptation to prematurely confront the suspected cheater firstly you will not get an honest response and secondly he she will now increase the precautions they are taking making it that much tougher to catch them if you feel you have gone as far as you can on your own hire a good licensed private investigator to obtain the hard evidence you need and get the closure you deserve contact thomasgonzalez gmail com
protecting his owner from being helped dogs don t intend much less think they react
my dog would do this but he wouldn‚Äôt stop at lying on me he‚Äôd necessitate the arrival of additional medical first responders to treat the wounds of the one trying to save my life
dogs the only truly loyal thing out there everyone strive to be more like dogs
replace it with a cat and not only would it not care but it may even be responsible for the incident
the dog seems to be nervous or scared its tail is between the legs
haha imagine having something that loved you like that knowing that nothing could stop it from defending you and having your back can only imagine what that feels like
when i had my seizure my dog just used it as a chance to sneak into the living room and steal the couch
omg what a good boy i hope they‚Äôre happily reunited
that s a black mouth cur i think i have one of those very very loyal mine will never let me out of his sight or my daughter he gets distressed when my kid and i are in separate rooms so i moved the computer to the kitchen table so he could keep track of us
man this dog had the worst day so afraid yet needs to be scary to protect family that here is a hero
my parents had a little chihuahua papillion he weighed maybe pounds when my mom got sick he refused to let anyone touch her he was ready to take on two grown men trying to put her in the emergency vehicle the could have obliterated him but he didn‚Äôt care because he had a job to do and that was to protect my mother i miss that dog he was so sweet i really hope all dogs go to heaven
god stop i m a grown man i can t cry aw fuck it üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
i think my dog would be straight up wagging her tail and rolling over at the attention she‚Äôs getting from the other guy she‚Äôs a cheating bitch
happened to a friend single cab ute was in a collision dog tied to the back wouldn t let emergency services near the owner the dog itself was pretty busted up unable to use it s back legs but would have a go at anyone that came near them time was critical so had to have police euthanize the dog that one haunted him for decades
i love the first one red eyed where is he green eyed o hi human just checking in
that s the monster patrol my kids used to cry that there are monsters under their bed i would send my cat in with the laser pointer they d hear scraping and stomping then i d point the laser outside of the room out of view of the kid and the cat would run out see hemmi chased them out or hemmi says there is nothing in there if he didn t care for the laser pointer that night
i guess everyone on reddit has the same target blanket as me
hello yes this is good bois bedtime monster patrol we put the floof in monster proof
actually they re the reasons you don t have monsters
these look really familiar to me oh wait the one on the left his name is sherlock and the one on the right is skylar they are goodest boys
where can i find monsters like that to live under my bed
i knew it wasn t going to be cats because you d have lost a finger the instant you touched the blanket
we call them tiny bed trolls in my household they linger in the dark hoping for dropped snacks and only appear when they want the scratches
i like how only their ears perk up pike yeah what we here and
oh man why did you do it this just reminded me of a dog i had for the longest she used to sleep under my bed üò≠üò¢üò≠üò¢
lol last time i checked under my friend s bed a cockroach flew into my face
was expecting a bunch of monster energy drinks but this is good no sarcasm
üé∂ i‚Äôm friends with the monster that‚Äôs under my bed üé∂
childhood memory my family rented the first floor of a house with a single guy renting the second floor when he went on a vacation he asked me to feed his cat it was my first job ever i was probably around on the first day i was worried because i couldn t find the cat and thought he might have gotten out i walked around the apartment and eventually looked under the bed i never knew that cats eyes glowed in the dark epic freak out
listening to old town road and as soon as you lifted up the cover the song dropped
my husky puppets loves to lay under the bed when my wife and i go to bed
why did i imagine the staying alive music by the beegees playing over this
idk why but this made me think of around the world by daft punk
i m sorry for being such a wet blanket but you shouldn t let your pets play near escalators they can be so dangerous
i feel the cat was put there and not there by choice
listening to the start of real life by interpol that guitar riff syncs up to the cat walk rlly well
oof i took me way too long to figure out there cat was on the hand rail of the escalator and not on the stationary stairs
just a word of advise do not make your cat do the same
human being thinks cat is too easily amused cat thinks human being is too easily amused and the cat is right
this is bindi she was taught how to do it by a professional trainer instagram catmantoo

i want to be a cat because no matter what idiot things i do will become so elegant
the best moment is when it tries to lay down and get comfortable
i had ‚Äústaying alive‚Äù immediately start playing in my head while watching this
i walk these empty streets on the boulevard of broken dreams

ya know it hits the feels when even the cameraman cries
reposted so many times i can‚Äôt even count it‚Äôs years old
way more touching than million dollar man russell wilson buying his mom a house
things like this always just remind me how this is not really possible to do where i live because of a tax on gifting equity in any form well you can do it but then you have to give enough so that the receiving end can pay the tax gt lt i really dislike that tax
that‚Äôs genuinely lovely i love reddit for random moments like this and people being nice to one another
no matter how many times i come across this it always fills my heart would cry again
i played too much fpl until i think it was south korean football player son
my parent were tasked with the job of survival and i with self actualization the immigrant generational gap is real what a luxury it is to search for purpose meaning and fulfillment amp x b i was redirected here from a friend s comment about the quote above the dude was a class act but i can t help thinking of how proud his immigrant parents are for their son and knowing that all the struggles in moving to a new country restarting over forgoing your dreams for your children finally paid off so happy for the family
thank you for posting this i was laying in bed reading the regular depressing things before starting my day this made me cry and made me happy i am going to try and hold onto this feeling that is enough internet for the day

dad s low key reaction shoved me over the teary edge
what app how do we support this guy and his family seems like if i am going to make a purchase from a company it might as well be a company or person who supports their family
i ve seen this so many times and it gets me every time beautiful
ive always hoped i will get a chance to do nice things like this for my parents too time will tell if i am lucky
i love this there is such a love and respect between them all melts my heart
how emotional i was like please don t let the dad cry but when the person taking the video cried i lost all my composure and sobbed
there‚Äôs a watermark on the first half unfortunately but it is removed on the second part i couldn‚Äôt find one without a watermark
the dog is like look at all these fluffballs the cat is like what have i done
when i was a kid i thought all the dogs were daddies and all the cats were mommies males would be puppies and females would be kittens i have no idea why
that one kitten that just looks up and yawns and you can see em kneading just stole my heart ‚ù§
that one little puppet at the end dhdhdhdhdhim dying
that cat is like ‚Äúmy god what have i gotten myself into‚Äù
i just wonder what does this person‚Äôs house smell like
this is cute and all but please spay neuter your pets there are puppies and kittens in shelters pounds that don t get adopted because of owners who let their pets breed then put then up on craigslist free to a good home
this is the slippery slope that gay marriage leads to i love it
imagine how many of these puppies and kittens are going to end up being euthanized in shelters when they can t find good stable homes spay and neuter your animals and don t support breeders
ah yes the surperior cat dog race always the best hybrid when breeding
i‚Äôm sorry i‚Äôm gonna have to report this it‚Äôs too damn cute and i can‚Äôt take it
mama dog looks fine with that mama cat looks pretty stressed out
soooo cute and soooo many animals for the human society to deal with in a year
i know there can be female orange tabbies but this is extra hilarious if you don‚Äôt know that
both moms have that crazed look of exhaustion stress and nerves all at the same time
this is so precious i swear it made me so emotional i love this so much ‚ù§Ô∏è
"here s the story
of a lovely lady
who was bringing up three very lovely girls
all of them had hair of gold
like their mother"
this is cute but i hope they have seperate areas in general and this get together is just for the video the cat looks clearly very stressed and the puppies would be very rough with kittens
i think whatever city this is in is headed for a disaster of biblical proportions
it is always great to see the behavioural differences in blended families like this i wonder if the kittens will have many dog traits dogs gain cat traits or both very cute though
in order for the dogs to drink milk it would be a girl and same for the cat so they aren‚Äôt reallly a family
wait does that mean the doge fuked the cat and the cat fuked the doge
here‚Äôs a story of a lovely golden who was bringing some very lovely pups all of the had hair of gold like their mother the youngest one had yips here‚Äôs a story of a cat of tabby who was busy with a litter of his own they were clowder living all together yet they were all alone til one day when this tabby met this golden and they knew it was much more than a hunch that this group must somehow form a family and that‚Äôs the way they all became the cat dog bunch
lol mama cat looks ticked off in the beginning there
this is exactly what bill murray prophesied in ‚Äòghostbusters‚Äô this is the end of times
that is so unbiblical i don t know what verses to quote but by god i know sin when i see it
dogs like that are the best i know people who have evil dogs that would just bite the heads off those kitties pitbulls greyhounds german short haired pointers killing innocent kitties makes me want to choke evil dogs out
i see this and i get sad knowing they won‚Äôt get to grow up together they‚Äôll probably all be split apart to random people and it‚Äôll just be the two og‚Äôs left wondering where their litters have gone after all that hard work
i wonder if they share moms to see who s species has better milk
at first this looked like the beginning of a perfect loop
i m so sad right now and this made me a little bit less sad thank you
"here s a story
of a lovely kitty
who was bringing up very lovely cat
all of them had fur of orange
like their mother
the youngest did not here s a story
of a dog named brady
who was busy with pups of her own
they were dogs
living all together
yet they were all alone til the one day when this kitty met this doggone
and they new that it was much more than a hunch
that this group must somehow form a family
that s the way they all became the brady bunch the brady bunch the brady bunch
that s the way we became the brady bunch"
the mums look so harassed lying together bound by their shared regrets
brings me back to late s early s had dogs and cats each have litters from october to december within months we had dogs and cats the kittens loved to climb and trash the xmas tree the puppies were a treat as well
cute but these people should spay and neuter their pets
whoever adopts these babies is going to enjoy many long years of catfetch and dogloafing
the title to this post can also be found on the dark web
spell dog with a few ess and that s how cute that dog is feeding her puppies with her cat friend and her babies just stop it already i need to drink more water now because my tears drained me thanx
this is probably the most wholesome thing i will see this entire month
the cat looks like its on it‚Äôs seventh espresso of the day
"here s a story of a lovely lady
who was bringing up some very lovely girls
all of them had hair of gold like their mother the youngest one in curls"
woofs and mews and woofs and mews that s what we re gonna cuddle
almost want to report for too much cuteness oh my god
this is disgusting interspecies families are unnatural and this is a sin
thought there would be a family of rats near the cats and a family of cheese near the rats
these comments about how dare they let their cats get pregnant bah bah bah are true but also so annoying a stray had kittens in our backyard and we kept them a lot of people that i know let their cat or dog have one litter only to continue the bloodline and kept them or gave them to family not every picture of a litter of kittens means that humans are monsters or that people that upvote and think an adorable kitten is adorable are supporting animal cruelty
plato said the good is the beautiful like this post thank you for making this
its so good to see a family of elephants and giraffes bond together ‚ù§Ô∏è
this kitty knows how to best protect her little family
this is so cute just like in our home we have a chicken s family playing with cats
question could a kitten drink a dog mom‚Äôs milk would it work the other way
i just wanna be in that room forever for the rest of my life
poor mother kitty she s being stressed out because her stupid humans forced her into this
that cat looked forced to be there do not like this
glad to see this doggo and cat crossing the interspecies divide
they re just too single moms working together to raise their babies right
i bet the mothers bond over the challenges of motherhood
and one of the kittens is a smaller animal nursing its own babies and so on
gonna be a lot of poop and pee everywhere for the next couple months haha
how do we know that these animals gave there consent to be filmed and milked like this
how do people get this lucky my dog want to kill all other creatures
i want to snuggle into this floofy pile it‚Äôd be like being in a ball pit full of adorable i assume
clearly this owner has neglected to teach proper sex ed
i thought the thumbnail looked like melted ice ream and then i thought the title meant someone ground up a family of animals
that poor mama cat looks miserable probably because this was a staged photo event
this is the hell the warned us about when they said gay marriage was a slipper slope where does it end
both mothers have the what have i done look mama kitty has seen some shit
amazing to see the after effects of the usa trade embargo on china
except the world is over full with cats and dogs without homes i was going to breed from my dog until someone pointed out how selfish it is to breed more when the world is already over supplied
i have many questions on how this family was blended
so do the kittens ever nurse from the dog do the puppies ever nurse from the cat
that is so gd cute i want to rip my f king eyes out
human sacrifice dogs and cats living together mass hysteria peter venkman
i‚Äòm not sure if everyone is aware but by buying dairy families like these cow families are violently destroyed and murdered ditch dairy for them
how do the babies know which one is the mom and which one is the dad
omg that‚Äôs just overwhelmingly cute just what i need to get through the last work day ü•∞
thank you this post killed me my heart exploded from the level of cute
before they are yanked from their mothers and given away
so cute mama was a smart cat to make a friend like him
whenever i see these feeding situations i always wonder if there‚Äôs a baby that isn‚Äôt getting any feeding i‚Äôm such a worrier for babies
the cat is pissed off the dog is happy dogs gt cats the end
alright now that‚Äôs the first time i am seeing this type of ‚Äòaction‚Äô
if this was a live stream it would be on all day in my house that is the most wholesome thing i have ever seen
although on the surface it seems cute because the cat and dog like each other but then you realize that this is staged and some chuckle head moved the animals close together to post the video on the internet for karma this irritates me so fake and staged leave the poor animals alone and let them nurse in private in their own area
mothers simply have a special understanding among each other
they re all the dog s children including mother cat
‚Äúthey call me tormund dogsbane when i was a kitten i killed a dog then climbed into bed with his wife ‚Äù kitten who was too hungry to care which nipple was whose
that is one of the sweetest things i have ever seen
i just pictured terry crews singing a version of blended ü§£
mom cat doesn t look pleased with this arrangement at all
looks like someone doesn t watch the price is right
theres always that one as le who wants to shove their pet s picture video on your face trying to take the attention away from op smh
dog mama look at my childrens even my adopted childrens are beautiful cat mama the nightmare i am living in it üòÇüòÇüòÇ
if this were any cuter it would cause a nuclear explosion of cuteness that would destroy the entire universe
that is without doubt the cutest fucking thing ive seen in my life
highly doubt the cat chose to lay there it looks mad as hell
lol i like how the mom cats just pissed surrounded by all the floofs
i just hope the cat and dog naturally wanted to be in the same room and the human owner didn t just shove them together for this video
that s not quite the correct usage of blended family that aside this may be the cutest cat dog interaction i ve seen in weeks üòä
if cats and dogs can get along what does that say about us humans
one fine day with a woof and a purr a litter was born and it caused a little stir
someone needs to tell that kitten its doing it wrong
if you have any questions about new dog things i d be happy to answer them had dogs my whole life
your puppy is the exact color pikachu would be if it was real
until i scrolled all the way down i thought this was a duckling
now he has to spend the rest of his miserable life smelling your sweat sack
too cute your first puppy definitely makes you understand why they re called man s best friend
i literally thought this was a pikachu at first glance just saw a coloured pencil drawing of detective pikachu so life like
taught my puppy to sleep on my chest lbs later i regret nothing
congratulations i m still waiting to be in a good position to get a puppy so sad i can t wait
it was years for me to my first puppy year after that was my second year after that was our first foster years since our first dog and we are over due to fostering be aware you may get sucked in
i m so happy for you i just got a puppy not long ago it s my second one at still the best feeling ever enjoy your new family member
i haven‚Äôt had a dog in over years and it‚Äôs killing me inside
just curious why did it take years to get your first puppy
years and you got the color perfect congrats on the new family memberüíï
cherish him my cousin who is allergic to dogs finally got his own puppy at now he is basically mine since he can barely bring himself to even take him outside and it makes me so sad for the pup
what a precious baby may your love story be the stuff of storybooks
mind me asking this cuties name so cute i want to snuggle
i bet you i went years without getting one shouldn t have waited that long lol he s so adorable you ll have the best time
do you work from home i really want a dog but working to monday to friday is stopping me from getting one the commute is around min so coming back home during lunch time is not an option either
aww it s exactly the same for me my very first puppy will move in in august and i m so excited i had to wait years too because my parents didn t want a dog
looking at the thumbnail i thought doggo was swimming in water
there is nothing in the world like a puppy lt i hope you two have a lifetime of love and happiness together
took me years and i couldn‚Äôt be happier too it‚Äôs amazing
me too my first puppy shes weeks old yours is super cutieeeee
i don‚Äôt mean to tarnish your good time but i think you should probably complain to someone it only took us a couple days to get ours
oh these puppy eyes this is the look of love ‚ù§Ô∏è congratulations i have three i can tell you a journey of so much love just about to start x
honestly didn‚Äôt know dogs could do this my chihuahua flips out if any water gets in her ears
if i m ever on a boat and the boat capsizes i will reach for a dog saved by the buoyancy of fluffiness
i held my breath each time he went down i was riveted
you re beautiful you re perfect you re linda evangelista
ladies don‚Äôt start fights but they can finish them üíñ
you‚Äôre already beautiful it does add a single cuteness point tho not that you weren‚Äôt cute already because you were what i‚Äôm trying to say is it makes you cuter than you already were
change out the flowers in the background they blend in too much she s a pretty girl
she looks like she does start fights but she can finish them
that is the most precious thing made me shed a tear
i ve seen it before but it still brings tears to my eyes
god dammit i did not give you permission to make me feel
that s so beautiful hope they get to spend lots of time together catching up and reminiscing
little do they know these men promised to break off contact after the war to forcibly extinguish the passionate love burning between them things are about to get weird for the grandkids
just goes to show even years can t kill a good bromance
this repost has been reposted so many times i think the dad is now years old
who s cutting onions in the rain during this indoor dust storm
as a veteran i know this would mean a lot to me when i m old
damn it i‚Äôm in work in the canteen watching this and now i can‚Äôt look up
these are the best types of videos seeing people happy is like this heartwarming
i never thought i d see you again gave me onion eyes
my old chief from my submarine days called me from my front yard and said where are you i m at the store where are you i m eating one of the apples off your tree one of the best things that could have happened to me military buddies are a special breed
i love how tex keeps glancing at his friend like d when they re taking pictures
‚Äúi never thought i‚Äôd see you again‚Äù my eyes have sprung a leak
i just reconnected with an old drinking buddy i haven‚Äôt seen in about years and it made me so happy can‚Äôt even imagine how these awesome dudes feel
the video is great for a whole bunch of reasons but those two guys also look great for
wait so tex hasn t seen his war buddy since he was lt why does he have a war buddy at that age i thought draft was at
now tex about that bucks you owe me from that weekend we spent banging whores in can tho
dang it now my eyes are red getting ready to walk into the gym this is awesome
you form a really unique and special connection with a war friend that you cant get anywhere else wholesome reunion
would love to sit down with these guys and just listen to them talk to each other bet they have some crazy stories
the dad sounds just like hank hill added to the wholesomeness
bawling now what a beautiful thing to do for your dad
in reality they usto hide in tents and suck each other off purple hearts all around
this is a great moment but i hate how someone asks for them to pose for a picture almost immediately
dammit its am i did not get on reddit this early to cry
i wonder what stories they shared that evening must be a lot if they are buddys
i got teary eyed the same moment the video camera did
love this if anyone is entitled to reparations it is the veterans
this needs more likes i literally got goosebumps i served years in the military but i never went through anything nearly as traumatic as the experience that caused these two men to share such a strong timeless bond
few things in life will ever match the bond of brothers in war
imagine the stories those two told that day what a precious gift those kids have those men
grandpa can t track down bf from war for years grandkids google search found him
god i hate videos like this they crush my heart and eyeballs
are you the one looking for tex damn she s got a short memory p
god damnit reddit stop making my eyes flood with this salty water
there was dallas from phoenix cleveland he was from detroit and tex well i don t remember where tex come from
this won t work for future generations we don t answer the door for anyone and just stare through the blinds until the mormons walk away
haha his buddy could not wait for that door to open to give em a big ol hug
that‚Äôs great i couldn‚Äôt imagine that feeling for all those years
the loss of self control hug at the beginning and then the manly handshake i love it
fucking aye i always cry to this one fuckkk when we says i thought i‚Äôd never see you again i die instantly
man i wish i could pull of the short sleeve button up like that guy
‚Äúand tex well i don‚Äôt remember where tex come from ‚Äù
friendship so powerful it makes the door frame bend
i wasn t trying to cry at work today this is simply beautiful
if they were bffs and both alive and well in america why didn‚Äôt they meet up for years
your not crying i‚Äôm crying wait dam just come here bro
tip to tip the kids call this docking seriously though i can t even begin to imagine the emotions going through both of them
most people cannot understand the bond that forms when you go through hell with someone else by your side
i think the craziest part about this the stories they must have to tell i know most of them went through hell too difficult to think about makes me really appreciate our veterans
moments like this is what makes the internet so great
the stories these guys are about to share would have loved to hear em talk about the war
the war buddy went in for the hug before tex could process what was going on poor tex tried to pull away a few times from the bearhug
there was dallas from phoenix cleveland he was from detroit and tex well i don t remember where tex come from
man reddit is wild it‚Äôs got the darkest most gruesome parts of humanity and then heartwarming moments like this thanks for sharing
they both looking good imagine in years how kids this generation gonna look that good without filters huehuehueee
good reminder of how insignificant my day to day work stress is
i adore seeing manly old men openly show genuine affection it s rare and beautiful
these two old boys even after embracing each other and crying for a good seconds they have to go in for a strong gentleman s handshake
i m crying because i worry when i get older i don t think anyone would knock on my door
the hug was beautiful but the handshake got me where you been buddy
til people in texas sound exactly like hank hill lol amazing
i m not crying you re crying wait we are all crying
would have been hilarious if that dad owes the friend money lol
i d never thought i see you again i can t be crying while taking a shit it s just weird
you know what is crazy about reddit some people on here can make me so damn mad sometimes and then stuff like this will bring damn tears to my eyes thanks for posting this great stuff
tex sounds like he sold propane and propane accessories after the war i‚Äôll tell you hwat
holy shit i have things to do i can‚Äôt cry at reddit videos all day what am i doing
drifting apart losing a friend organically is such a painful thing but this feeling just the pure unadulterated pleasure of the company of someone you thought you d lost i cannot imagine how powerful it should be i used to feel sad that the older i grow i don t feel wonder as an emotion as much this video makes me believe that maybe and hopefully i m wrong
the funny thing about men is that even when decades separate you from the last time you saw each other you tend to act the same way you did back then towards one another i have experienced this with ex military and ex college buddies that when we reunite we go back in time with our interactions behavior wise for those you have been staying close with your interactions transform through the years i‚Äôd suspect these two‚Äôs interactions were not unlike they were years ago
yawning is contagious crying is sweeping the national in an epidemic that happiness was so wholesome i really appreciated this
and to think sometimes i see someone i know and we both pretend not to see and walk by looking away
he cant believe it s real and that s the sweetest part
people that suffer through things together have a very special bond especially those in war words can not describe the bond you make with people in high stress situations that you are in together
women seem to get a certain special pleasure from seeing grown men cry
years apart and absolutely zero hesitation they knew exactly who each other were amazing
people who can recognize others after decades amaze me i remember looking at a pic of my so in high school that was when were were in our late s and i thought to myself good thing he told me that was him i d never have recognized him
epicurus said not what we have but what we enjoy constitutes our abundance i really appreciated this
that hug was so wholesome the camera itself teared up
my dad s best friend when he was a kid was called moose and that s the only name i ever heard him refer to him by we were both travelling separately and supposed to meet in the panhandle at moose s house but i wound up getting there a day early and realized i didn t know his real name i stopped at what i was pretty sure was his house and saw a man and woman outside in the yard and i asked if they knew anybody around here called moose his wife immediately said no but lamar moose held up his hand and said now hold on a minute
im literally crying they are so happy to see eachother
this may be the most awesome thing i have seen the whole day
dammit just another day of me sitting in my office crying
you go through hell with someone you re brothers for life time and distance don t matter anymore fuck me i gotta make some phone calls this weekend
even in the depths of hell blooms a beautiful flower of friendship
damn you making me feel at work amp x b stupid ninjas cutting onions near me
people can repost this one as much as they like it ll never stop making me smile
an awweee moment where i shed a tear this is the most precious ever ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
i‚Äôm not emotional but somehow this literally just made big fat tears stream down my eyes
looking forward to explaining to my boss why my trip to the restroom left me in tears
this has to be the best video i ve seen in a long time thank you for your service sirs
this is a very touching moment really feels like this shouldn t have been recorded like we re intruding on what should be a private moment
yo dawg it s too early for me to be crying in my cubicle
no matter how many times this is posted i start cutting onions each and every time
not even gonna bother with any onion jokes i just straight up cried omg
i m a hugger not only a hugger but a long hugger this guy puts me to shame there is a lot of emotion in that embrace says more than words ever could
jesus why don t these videos come with warning labels
if you look like that with if you re in the army fucking sign me up
when you been in the shit with someone and experienced trauma like you get from warfare you create a bond with someone that is incredibly strong sixty years later these men are still bonded in a way most of us will never understand
this is so sweet it s crazy how he immediately recognized his buddy too
anyone else notice he sounds like hank hill seem fitting for man who‚Äôs nickname is tex
im tired if these heartwarming fucking moments with grandpas i dont want to fucking see these anymore ive just never fucking met my grandpas and i just fucking hate that i never got to
where are such nice kids till now i have only met the annoying ones
how is that a trick if it s really the same guy that called him that
this war generation and other wars has a bond that no one back home can even think of imaginating these guys had eachothers back for years holidays birthdays and anniversaries
awww soooo sweet and heartwarming to those men i thank you for your service
i can only imagine what these two endured and faced together to form such a tight bond that picked up years later after no contact i m happy you guys were able to reunite them
oh my goooood that is just too dang precious what a wonderful gesture from this man s lovely kids
ol‚Äô tex gave the hug tap out about times before his buddy relented haha
this makes me want to start screaming out names of guys i served with in the marines that i would love to see again
and here i am can t recognize someone i met a week ago
i bet he has a minute staredown with that plant every time he goes out of his house always check em bushes
damn onions somebody must be cutting them in the kitchen even though i‚Äôm the only one here
file that under things i shouldnt have watched in front of anyone else fuuuuuuuck just that bond no words needed the things those must have seen and went through together
and another repost which i didn t see this year yet still a repost
why did you do this to us üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è this is so precious
i d rather watch a shaky video than that stabilization crap
bro hugs man aren t they precious im and they both look better than me
that was really sweet might have shed a single tear drop there
ahhhhh fuck this breaks my heart this got me to tears quick my dad is a war vet and talks about how he misses his old war buddies and i just lost my best friend of years last july i will never know what true friendship means ever again üíîüíî
that s love i hope everyone is able to experience that level of friendship
this is so amazing what a great story finally some good news
awesome to see them reunite with each other both don‚Äôt even look like they are either
that s the sweetest thing i ve seen in a long time thanks for posting
why are old people always so well groomed and dressed i feel like such a slob
i can t be going from the grumpy cat post to this one crying all day for different reasons guys i ve been awake ten mins ffs
i was watching this in public saw them hug felt a lump in my throat nope turned it off but i get the jist üò¢
is there another source for this it plays for seconds and then it stops
these are the videos that make life worth living wish i could locate some of my dad s buddies from the navy in the s not to film but to reunite
this was posted here a couple of months ago didnt get any awards then the repost gets
how do you even recognize someone from years ago serious question
tex is all in except he also was like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre letting all the ac out ‚Äù
good for everyone involved the internet is a better place today
those dudes look at most i hope i m that handsome at
some of the baddest mofos around without a doubt these two have seen some shit
why do people keep reviving old posts i mean don‚Äôt get me wrong im very touched by what happened in the video and very happy for them
oh wow the last two members of the flying hell fish from wwii
that hug nay that embrace was beautiful just held each other for so long damn that s emotional stuff
look at their old man pockets overstuffed front pocket of shirt has everything necessary to rebuild society met a guy once who had year old receipts ‚Äújust in case‚Äù in that pocket
i m at work goddammit now i have to pretend my computer crashed without saving to explain these tears
this is amazing thank you for sharing this beautiful moment
i never thought i would see you again really weird how life was before technology you would have no way of keeping touch with buddies from the army who live on the other side of the country letters are not efficient no video calls and flying was expensive
these damn allergies my eyes just won t stop watering
i wish they showed us a pic of when they were younger in their military uniform
a family friend s dad ww vet would have lunch with his squad mates i think thats the term every week at least the ones who were still in the area up to their s before the numbers started dwindling started at or and when the dad died just were left life long bond and i m sorry this guy missed out on those years with his best friend
am i correct in guessing they fought together in korea
i hope somebody with deeper pockets than mine gives you another platinum this made my day
i think old men crying is the most touching thing i can think of and saddest given the situation
i would have loved to sit there at the table having some coffee and cake and just listening to all the stories they must have
my mom did this same thing but he walked into a diner where my gramps was having lunch with all of us my gramps was a very religious methodist man and never cussed or drank or smoked but we heard a couple crazy stories sitting there that day like how time they robbed a couple of their bikes and took them into some italian town and got drunk he wouldn‚Äôt talk about the war except that day
i feel like the saddest part of this reunion is that i don t have a friend i would break down seeing again granted it s only been a couple years since i haven t seen them and nowhere near but it s still kinda disappointing
two men turned to boys in a matter of seconds powerful
just two dudes hugging and crying it out fucking classic
military brothers are closer than almost my entire family if one of them called me and said they needed help i would drop everything and be on a plane some of the guys i haven‚Äôt seen in years now it‚Äôs a different mentality hard to explain
i‚Äôve seen this times and it never fails to hit me right in the feels so awesome
i was just trying to eat my lunch and now i m over here crying happy tears for them
war is a strange thing it kills and destroys but it also brings two people closer than otherwise
that s some textbook brotherhood folks warms my heart
that i thought i d never see you again hit the feels hard currently crying in my car at the gas station
not to take away from the awesome video but what s up with the camera waving like that
whoooo that‚Äôs some strong warp stabilization you got there
you can tell how much that meant to them so touching üíóüíó
didn t realize docking was how you say hi if it s been over yrs between meetings
seconds into the video and i m crying like a baby in subway
true friendship is very special that bond can last a lifetime i m so happy for these two
i regret i ll never know how strong of a relationship war buddies have but also thankful that i don t have to because of men women like them
years doesn t make sense to me they sent year olds to war
man i want this story so bad now like what was their time in the military together like what were their experiences when they were a part of each others lives and where did life take them after that i d love to get all the backstory fascinating
i just did my fucking make up worth the happy tears
i‚Äôm sorry i swear to god i heard a kingdom hearts pause sound effect was tex playing kh
the stabilisation on this footage makes it look like we re about to get a flashback to some exciting war time adventure
read the description tried to prepare myself for the feels to hit wasn t ready in time ah fuck this got me good
as usual exactly what s been happening lately guy reposts something from a couple of months ago gets platinum and gold the fucks happening to reddit these rewards are meant for people who actually contribute not those who dig up old stuff
this is so beautiful to see bless those men and the value they have
what his buddy thought they had some amazing friendship and tex was just like ‚Äúi thought i‚Äôd never have to see that bastard again why did you do this ‚Äù but for real made me weep and wish i had a good friend like this
wow this gave me waterworks like almost instantly and i didn‚Äôt know i had that in me
seen this many times still get the feels every single time
well now i m crying there is nothing like seeing elders happy and smiling about friends
i wanted to reconnect with a buddy from the navy amp x b my heart sank when i found his obit and he had already been dead for fifteen years
i hate when i‚Äôm trying to watch a video and dust gets in my eye eyes both of them someone turn off the dust
i cant take this one i m tough and rough these guys were men manly men and i cant even watch the lion king
i love this the reaction from both of them is wonderful
man it s been a while since last time i shed a tear thank you for posting this
dammit op s got me crying at work and we re out of tissue
shit there s a lot of meaningless sentimental shit that doesn t hit me at all this though
oh god the digital image stabilization is horrible i hate phones that do that by default
damn they look like some straight up american ass men
‚Äúhow you been tex ‚Äù ‚Äúgood you ‚Äù ‚Äúgood ‚Äù ‚Äúgood ‚Äù end of convo
dangit isn‚Äôt this supposed to have an nsfw tag so i don‚Äôt blubber like a baby at work so sweet üò≠
i can only imagine what it feels like to make friends with someone during war time your lives depend on each other
i want a war buddy too for sure it‚Äôs worth all the ptsd
damn that made me cry before i even got a chance to anticipate it to think of the things that they saw together and then to know all those years later that each other had survived beyond awesome
i miss my bff haven‚Äôt seen her in almost two years on a good note though she finally got on social media lol
i m at work and that made me cry lol smh that s a display of true friendship that stood the test of time
sometimes i feel like abandoning reddit because well reasons and then an op like this comes along and i remember why i like reddit again
just curious which war that s so sweet they got to reunite
you haven t changed a bit imagine going through the unspeakable hardship that is war and only the people who were there really have a sense of how it felt then to return home readjust to civilian life have a family amd grow old but you never again have that kinship to those people that have endured what you endured only to have one of your brothers show up at your door years later and discover that he lived a full life and also went through those same things you did even when you fell out of contact with one another
i m a year old grown ass man and i m sitting here crying at my desk because the fucking wholesomeness of this video god damn those men are living heroes
i can‚Äôt describe how much i love this video truly a treasure
plot twist tex tried to kill him back then and he s been hiding for the last sixty years of course he can t admit that so when his friend shows up he has to pretend like everything is normal
fuck ya what a great gift to give thank you for sharing
hi idk how to view the reply i received thank you get to me when you can
it really makes you think about the incredible bond they must have developed after living through hell together
it‚Äôs a shame men have to join a gang or go to war for it to be socially acceptable to care about each other we all need to work on our brotherhood skills in everyday life
darn it reddit i gotta save these tears for my sister s wedding
genuinely legit question the internet and public sources have been available for literally decades why did it take so long for the reunion did they not know about his friend was it just a logistics timing thing years without seeing your bestfriend i can t imagine
all of my emotions just bubbled up in my body and came out of my a hole i farded
something to think about with this who in your past would you like to just show up at your door to catch up can you reach out to them
if there s one thing you never forget from the military it s your nickname in the squad
this is beautiful thank you so much for sharing this ‚ô•
tex or text if someone is looking for text they should check their phone
this is soooo amazing my ww vet grandfather passed last year at and we managed to get him to his hometown a few years before he passed and i think it was one of the most amazing thimgs i ve ever seen i m sure these two studs stayed up super late telling old stories at least pm
how dare you make me feel feelings take yer darn upvote
put some pictures of them back then to compare i m sure they wete both pretty handsome
im not misty eyed you are even the fucking camera is crying apparently unless i m so stoned i m seeing the video wobble
the only thing more interesting then the stories these two could share is their bond
plot twist dad ghosted his buddy years ago after a arguemmt in the field and found him annoying af he thought he got rid of him for good after he moved far away and told him his only name was tex his reaction is the realisation that this mf found him and his nightmare starts again
somebody get this bowl of fresh cut onions outta here
warms the heart speaks volumes about the experiences they shared
dammit now i m sitting on the toilet dropping a deuce and crying at the same time thanks op
i got emotional then thought i was having a lsd mirage at the same time
man i just pulled into work why you gotta make me cry before i walk into my job üò≠üòÇ
i cannot upvote this any harder my grandfather served in wwii and one thing i‚Äôve learned is that the bond that‚Äôs shared between two war veterans who served together is something that can not be described
year old man here balling my eyes out on a friday afternoon on the may weekend just great
such pure and sweet friendship bought a tear to my eye
ok but why did they fuck up the prices of housing so much
welp now i‚Äôm crying it‚Äôs too cute i couldn‚Äôt help myself ‚ù§Ô∏è
even after tears and bro hugs a true warrior and a gentleman s handshake god bless amp thank yall for your service
the longer the hug went on the more tears came to my eyes
the door frame is having a party did you use warp stabilizer
there s too much brotherly love here for my eyes to stay dry
that s awesome i m not crying someone is cutting onions
this was the ending of brokeback mountain we all wanted
my granddad was in ww but he is turning this year which made him years old when the war started was able to join when he turned years old which means that in he joined the war the war ended in making my granddad years old when it was over so in the honor of my granddad thank your dad and his friend for serving in what ever war they fought in
i would watch a minute documentary about their story leading to this day
the instant recognition is pretty impressive after years i get that basic features pretty much are set by the age they came to know each other but still
i think they may have been more than just war buddies
i just think how hard it must be for so many men of this age who didn t grow up learning to express feelings or that it was okay for men to be vulnerable and to be reunited with someone who gets you who has been through the struggles of war with you how healing and beautiful this could be i m tearing up
glad i didn‚Äôt wear mascara today because the tears jumped out this is so wholesome
best bud s see each other more than every years of course time s are different but we ve had telephones for a few years now
i feel even after yrs without seeing each other their eyes when they met you can see them recognizing each other just because eyes doesn t change as much as the body eyes are truly the window of our souls
you that training never goes away straight for the neck and squeeze
this made me cry if i weren t in public right now i d be bawling
why didn‚Äôt they find each other sooner is my question
i hope i get to see an old friend like that when i m ancient
these kind of things are awesome but i wish people would just enjoy the moments rather than post the videos online
i had a smile all the way through that i‚Äôm so happy for them
you can tell they‚Äôve been through some shit together
love reddit one minute i‚Äôm seeing a dude take a shot off someone‚Äôs empty eye socket the next i‚Äôm watching this amazing
love reddit one minute i‚Äôm seeing a dude take a shot off someone‚Äôs empty eye socket the next i‚Äôm watching this awesome video
imagine after a couple of stories one or both realises mistaken identity
now that s a name i ve not heard in a long time a long time
i wouldn t mind to watch a few hours of their conversation and stories as someone that hasn t seen his best friends in years this strikes home
i had a shit day and this warms my cold fucking heart
‚Äúnow i don t know much about anything but i think some of american s best young men served in this war there was dallas from phoenix cleveland he was from detroit and tex was well i don t remember where tex come from ‚Äù fg
aww beautiful imagine what they must have endured you can almost feel it in their embrace many thanks to all war veterans across the world especially the old guys those were wars of a different time not that any war is good of course
my father is a vet he had one buddy he spent a lot of time with before he got honorably discharged due to an injury his buddy continued to serve ended up settling down across the country from my father few years later i hear that my aunts friend at her church married this ol sailor brad from colorado they all started talking and realized it was my father s friend from his time my father is set in his way that brad has a better life and doesn t want to bother him even though he says he d like to see him again but one day i ll be damned i m going to get those two together again every happy moment in my father s life was with brad
been a while since i started crying because i m happyüò≠üò≠üò≠
not a very good friend if he hasn t heard from him in years lmao
if you didn t tear up a little bit on that one you re not human
i like to think the camera warped during parts of this video because it was crying from joy too what a beautiful reunion
he called him ‚Äúbamboo boa‚Äù from that alone we no he was a deadly man in the war
ah yes here is my heart please punch it again thank you i love this lt
i love you so much unconditionally chicken do you also love me i love chicken you you are my hero
this is literally me when i want some of my boyfriend s food
he s definitely trying to butter you up with those head butts
fucking abyssinians man we declared ours a gourmet cat because her main goal in life is to taste every single dish known to man she s on my back right now purring and rubbing her face against my head while i try to do my private buisness
reaches for chicken no ok then he needs some more buttah
haha look how proud he is with his catch that tail shows a very satisfied kitty
this is the cutest thing i ve ever seen i love her little cat walk
it‚Äôs a repost but i‚Äôll never get tired of seeing this cat and their tiger apparently they just steal it from the neighbors
i don t like how he crossed the road without looking both ways first üòî
you know very well what he s gonna do to that toy or you should
the whole time i was thinking aww this is a delusional mama cat who thinks she s rescuing her kitten lies down and bites kicks the shit out of tigger nope
gt m hellcat attacking a panzer vi tiger during the battle of bulge circa colorized
cats have such pride and purpose in their walk when they re carrying something in their mouth
congratulations to them and for having the courage to track and kill this deadly predator and come out as non binaryüëç
i had a maine coon who would bring me a stuffed hedgehog he would cry until i complimented him he was a good kitty
yea i would much rather get this on my doorstep than a mouse
apparently it was the next door neighbors kids the cat did release the tiger and it did make it home safely according to my mother who already saw the video
when i was a child my family had a siamese who also would carry around a tiger plush toy like that but after carrying it he‚Äôd hump it
our cat used to steal the neighbour s stuffed toys from inside their house then bring them back here for our dog to destroy very embarrassing
when my parakeet did this it was because she was cold turned out she was sick
i am the birb no nest for me is in the hair i wanna be i d rather stay right here instead in back of favrit hooman s head behind the ponytail i hide n no one knows that i m inside i found the place that s most discreet am sleepy little parakeet
how much bird shit do you suppose is hidden in there
went camping a while back and we were watching a huge bat colony flying two bats decided to fly into my moms hair and ever since then she has such a phobia of anything flying into her hair one of the funniest moments in my life haha
we also had a parrotlet that loved to burrow and go to sleep in our hair like this rip lil buddy
pay no attention to the bird in the hair now i wish to aquire your freshest seeds fellow human
i don t understand what i m looking at it it just focuses on the girls hair then pulls back is their a cute animal i m missing or something like that
in the words of h delirious i was behind you the whole time
this is probably the first post on this sub that actually made me ‚Äòawww‚Äô out loud not that the other posts aren‚Äôt super adorable this one is just extra special üòä
it must ve been a weird moment for it to get in that position bird just moving around your hair until it was comfy
is there video and sounds i know that bird is making cute cherps but i must hear
it s warm fuzzy and private the perfect place to live breathe and pee
it s warm fuzzy and private the perfect place to live breathe and defecate
a few people at my local pet store will work with a bird tucked in like this i didn‚Äôt even notice the little fella when i was being rung up until the person had to adjust their hair
i like how the baby goes from not sure about this to oh my god these ears
who puts his kids next to pets like that its unhelathy and unhygenic
not sure about happy baby but that husky loves his little head rest human
i thought you were being completely sarcastic about the happy baby part for the first of the video
i remember the first episode of inuyasha where kagome encounters the unconscious inuyasha pinned to a tree and could not resist touching his dog ears i could empathize so well
man at first that baby made the grumpy cat look like he was happy
baby looked like it wanted to puke after the dog licked him
"it‚Äôs really fascinating to see dogs being so protective and caring towards human babies
wonder why they do so"
baby goes from wtf dude to yass fluffy ears really quick
i ve seen a hundred of these video s of milper dog straight eats his ass for minutes then goes straight to licking this babies face
pretty sure this is a malamute too big to be a husky
for a minute i thought we had found the new grumpy cat
this is cute n all but these videos also make me kinda angry baby‚Äôs like this can be very grabby and i feel for the poor dog that isn‚Äôt so lucky when the baby grabs the shit out of that ear downvote me all you want but it‚Äôs straight up irresponsible
isn t this baby and husky from that youtube channel i think it is milperthusky
i m cringing looking at the ears because my baby nephew grabs things and surprisingly has the grip of suns
i like how the baby‚Äôs reaction to lick is ‚Äú eh okay i‚Äôll take it‚Äù
omg this is so cute and evil pets are so manipulative little buggers it s even more sweet and pesty when they do this subtle heart wrenching guilt trip type thing
how are you supposed to step out of your house because of this
dear fren i know you gonna leave i am the dog you make me grieve so as you try n close the door i stick my snoot in it once more am hoping for a final pet so me my fren you won t forget that when you go you ll keep in mind that i am waiting here behind
omg the way his head goes up and down and the eyes are so cute
i hope my dog never figures out how to do this because the face she makes as i m leaving is soul crushing on the other hand i d like to see my bf try to leave out of town for work after witnessing this level of puppy eyes and snout
i would cancel my plans and call in sick to work if my dog did this
you can t just leave without doggo or at least feeling guilty to do so
i d always be calling out of work if this happened to me
i wouldn t care where i m going it s coming with lol
my dog is much more forceful than this when asking me not to leave
here s the thing boss my dog is guilt tripping me so i m gonna have to miss that important meeting which can change my career dogs ‚ô•Ô∏è
when my lab does this i tell her i have to go that she s a good dog and i love her she gets so lonely though dogs ought to come in pairs
‚Äúyou‚Äôre basically shutting the door on my head karen is this who you‚Äôve become ‚Äù
if that s not the true definition of puppy dog eyes i don t know what is
my dog always gets real pathetic like this when she knows you re leaving sits up gives you her paws to pet ears back the whole routeine to look sad lol so sometimes i put on my coat and jingle my keys to leave she does the routine then i pet her and pretend that she convinced me to stay take everything off be super happy and play with her a bunch i feel like it makes her day with the successful play
this is my dog when i head to school in the morning
honestly this is what makes me scared to get a puppy i d never be able to leave a face like that for hours a day
christ almight did this little fellow coin puppy dog eyes i d do anything for it
if my dog did this to me well i would be unemployed because i would never be able to go to work
the worst is when they do this when you are only going to the bathroom
this is why i throw a couple treats out as i leave my house
i hate it when my dog does this makes me damn sad for leaving to school i once gave in and just spent all morning cuddling with him because he was looking at me with his sad face morning well spent
dogs get away with so much shit that they would get their asses kicked if they were human
i think this video would be enough to justify a sick day if i sent it to my supervisor ‚Äúcan‚Äôt come into work today i‚Äôve come down with a serious case of guilted‚Äù
hey boss i m going to have to work from home today the dog again yes alright give him a pet from me
okay here s what you re going to do you re going to quit your job and give this guy a proper petting alright good
holy shit just pet the damn dog you heartless son of a bitch
i like how when you open the door and the dog is like oh back so soon
when dogs do this is it because they don‚Äôt want you to go or are they just trying to play with you
my buddy put his go pro on his lb mastiff to see what happens after the buddy leaves his house wo the dog he said it was heartbreaking the go pro shows the dog just staring at the door for about minutes lol
i hate these gifs looks so uncomfortable when the dogs face is between frame and door
i have to tell my dogs and cats that i have to go to work to make the money so i can buy the treats they still give me the sad look when i leave
i really want to get a dog again but this video just reminded me how tough it was to leave the house for anything you should pair it with a video of you coming home seconds later then it will be happy again
we have a doggy door and our german shepherd watches me pull out of the driveway with this same look every day
‚Äúum yea i‚Äôm not gonna make it in today no no i‚Äôm not ill it‚Äôs just my dog is holding me hostage‚Äù üòÜ
this is why i can t get a dog i d never leave it screw work and responsibilities
i love how he knows he s not supossed to step out so he just sits there giving you those big sad eyes
god this breaks my heart and it is the reason i don t have a dog
well op i guess your stuck there for the rest of your life
the sweet ‚Äòinnocent‚Äô manipulation dogs throw at us is one of the reasons i love them so much i would never leave the house if i owned this pup
i was compelled to watch this video five times because of those eyes
stuff like this is why i got my pet a pet my cat was always getting lonely and bored even though i d play with him for hours a day so eventually i got him a kitten now it s so much easier if he can t be with me he is with her and they don t mind it one bit he still greets me when i m gone for hours but doesn t get pissy and mad cus i can t play with him all day
that little nose nudge to the side like no closing the door
‚Äúhi yeah i can‚Äôt come into work today yeah cough cough i‚Äôm sick ‚Äù
i love that he slowly wedges his head as you close the door
oh god that look of hope in his eyes as the door opened again just crushed me i i couldn t do it to him i d have to stay there forever
i didn t see the picture and thought you meant eve from wall e
so awesome as a landscape photographer my dream is to be able to visit epic locations with a dog and combine my two passions sadly here in new zealand a lot of places are dog free zones and also you can t take them on planes
this is one of the best pictures i‚Äôve ever seen not even joking
eva is now the light of my life please give her a pet and a cuddle for me
she thought the view was grand i thought she was grander
jeez i spend too much time online my first thought was cue the dive bombing eagle
what kind of dog is this my shelter dog looks exactly like her and i‚Äôd love to know the breed
i wonder how many ticks had to be removed from that pupper
i knew it would be a spaniel even before he popped up my sprocker is happiest when she is being tick bait
i would be so paranoid about snakes and bugs hiding in there
i wonder what would happen if the guy ducked down in the grass in between doggy jumps deep thoughts
can you see me now how about now can you see me over here how bout there i m awesome aren t i master üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüêæüêæüêæüêæ
i thought this was gonna be a jab at someone‚Äôs height or size in the back lol
why would someone think it‚Äôs clever to have a police officer pull you over that‚Äôs not a pleasant experience at all i‚Äôd be seriously pissed off of someone did some stupid crap like this as a ‚Äúreveal‚Äù
so yeah heres your violation ticket you have days to pay
two police officers inform a local man they impregnated his wife
i can‚Äôt believe the cop slapped the guy he could‚Äôve injured the baby üò±
any cop video that shows that there are good cops out there gets an upvote from me
clever reveal and good on the cop for showing compassion but does anyone else cringe when police lean on other people s cars like that idk why but it bothers me
yeah my dog does this all the time it s usually a sign that he wants to be petted is that right
i was determined to see this even though it was super slow
it‚Äôs normal paced for me very cute pupper i like your tables corner guards
didn t know they made table corner protectors for dogs
don t mind me just zooming in on your board game collection
i have the black version of this dog what type of dog is yours
one of my grandparents sheep does this he s so friendly and acts like a dog letting you stroke him and jumping up for treatsüòÇ
my dog would just lick my hand til she gets tired of it and walk away my other dog however would lick it and nibble on it
place for face now boop my snoot and tell me how i‚Äôm the goodest doggo
that‚Äôs the spot my shiba places her ball though she does not let go
what kind of dog is this i have a lovable mutt and she has a lot of similar features
he got the idea of what he is supposed to do too unlike the one to the far right
those wheels aren t doing shit for him in the sand get him some skis
but what about the lil doge that didn‚Äôt even make it past the starting line
my dachshund was paralyzed temporarily and we bought him one of these luckily medication and laser therapy helped him recover he is pretty much normal now just has a drunk run
of course he lost those wheels aren t for off roading
i don‚Äôt care what the results were that boy gets the gold
i don‚Äôt care what you guys say he came in first first in the race to my heart
legit thought this was about the one on the far right who doesn t even go until the last couple seconds
you talking about the wheelie wiener or the i m not running wiener
the first time i ve ever legitimately wanted to give a post more upvotes
i needed this as i‚Äôm sitting at the dmv good job little pup
in sand that little guy deserves an extra medal for rolling through the nastiest substrate known to wheels
he s the kid in like th grade who joins the gym relay race and is just happy to be there he s doing bad but he s happy he s therer
i like that he stopped for a snack on the way you know to re energize
where i m from saying bless your heart is a backhanded way of telling someone there stupid so are we all calling a dog dumb for being physically disabled
never doubt the heart of a dachshund the standard size dachshund was developed to scent chase and flush out badgers fucking badgers and other burrow dwelling animals
this is wonderfully cute but can we talk about the quality of this gif
i m pretty sure i follow this same dog on instagram the account is princessliloweenie her little diaper is so adorable
i grew up with dachshunds i miss their little wiggly smiles
humans are such trash making a two legged dog race on a hot beach for your own entertainment
install remote controlled motor hubs so buddy outruns everyone next time
deep down he knows he s the winner or should is say wiener
they need a rematch the gate came up slower on his side and allowed the other doges to leave the starting line with a head start
and he still didn t even lose because of that idiot on the right
he s the winner if he can move like that in his wheels in the sand then he d smoke them on all
where is this and when are the events how do we get notified when this is happening
props to the one on the right who just wanted some love
saw this was about to go hug our doxie then remembered he passed away too days ago am sad now rip speed bump
you might laugh but this lil fella gets all the bitches
well that s highly discriminating humans with disabilities are treated like utter scum and here we have people in awe over a dog
here s to both of your firsts you will have oh so many more those am cat zoomies are a fun first üò∫
hello my baby hello my darlin hello my rag time gal
you may have missed the gym but you are still going to get a workout congrats
steve and alex since it s minecrafts th anniversary
dandelion and clover you can call him danny boy as a nickname
a pei pei i never got to see mine as a pup but that is how i imagine he would have looked
love seeing such nicely trimmed nails what a smoosh frodo is
aaaawww it s a dog over bred to the point of disability so cute lt
it took me minutes to understand what the hell i m looking at i m dumb
this looks cute and i m interested in getting one but are there any generic health issues that come along with its skin being folded so many times
if you had resisted i would think that you were a monster please give that beautiful some pats for me
i may be a bit bias but whatever aussies are the greatest also the cutest pups
looks like you re in a pet store i really hope you didn t buy that puppy there
i hope you are ready to give that dog a job where it can run for most of the day because if you can t do that this is not going to be a very happy animal
malcolm will never be in the middle with all that adorableness lots of hugs treats squirrels to chase not eat lol and love best life ever
the detail above his eye makes him look like that sophisticated winnie the pooh meme
i have never felt this before because i‚Äôm not a dog person but he looks like a really good boy

acadia is one of the most beautiful places on earth congratulations to both of you
gorgeous ring shell and location bet girl is gorgeous too congrats
you messed with her childhood stuff isn‚Äôt that a little bit shellfish
op did you leave the clay on the beach for her to find that would be brave
as someone who doesn‚Äôt like my items modified that‚Äôs a hell of a risk to take
with that manicure she knew it was coming ladies you know what i m talkin about
if you guys were waiting to have sex until marriage the whole clam shell ring thing is a nice touch

yes oh nice now hold it open please so i can snap a picture for reddit
like getting a new shell would have been so hard you had to fuck up hers
he s probably sick birbs usually don t let humans this close unless they re injured in some way or the off chance that he was a pet of some kind in which case congratulations you are meow the proud new owner of reb birb
ok an update he just flew off not sure if he‚Äôs sick but he is long gone from me
this has happened to me before when a bird flew into a window he sat there stunned for a while and i was able to hold and pet him eventually he got his bearings and flew away
he was mediating you were lucky not to be turned into statue by disturbing him
wildlife biologists here looks like i am late to the party and everything worked out but the bird most likely collided with a window and was stunned if this does happens in the future the best thing you can do is leave it alone if it is in a safe spot if it is in a busy area or a place where it is not safe from other animals or people to help it stay calm while it is recuperating you can put it in a cardboard box make sure it has holes so it can breath leave it is a quite spot for a half hour and then open it up outside and see if it flies off if it doesn t it may have worse injuries like a broken wing in which case you should take it to a rehab facility or person
correct me if i‚Äôm wrong but i believe you sir are now a disney princess
came here to gleefully be the bad news animal person but everyone beat me to it oh well off to point out animal mishandling and grim tidings
sick or may has head trauma i‚Äôm sorry but it might not make it only know cause i‚Äôve been through this before
that would have been a risky click if i hadn t checked which sub
so cute cardinals are my favourite bird followed by loons and blue jays
this happened to me once i realized the bird was in shock after i interrupted a hawk s attack on it
ok i asked my mom and apparently he was there for a while after hitting our window a bit away he wasn‚Äôt sick just hit his head
the bird probably flew into a window or got into some fruit that was overripe and had fermented most likely gonna be just fine amp x b in the future you can call the audubon society in cases like this
he s that bird from angry birds just check if there s any pigs around
yeah he just hit that upstairs window now he is trying to shake it off
this happened one time with a canary that flew into our window at my job years ago as canaries are not at all common in the area i m at we assumed it was a pet but it was just sitting there in the street almost getting run over by cabs picking up from the hotel across the street so i went out picked it up placed it in a tissue box and put it up in the branches of a tree for safety s sake i flew away on its own about mins later this cardinal may have had a big crash minor concussion and just needed to rest it off
this almost happened to be once a black bird flew into my conservatory window and shit itself me and my mum went outside to check if it was ok and give it a cracker it was fine and flew off a similar thing happened to a pigeon when it fell of the conservatory roof apparently it went up to the back door of our house pecked on it and my mum found it sat at the door we hid it for a while to see if would fly off but it didn‚Äôt so my mum took it to the vets and would let me stroke it we don‚Äôt know what happened to the pigeon
wow i don t think he s sick but for you to get that close to a wild red cardinal is one hell of a privilege they don t usually let you get this close no wild bird does it might be that he was beat like a hall carpet and needed a rest he may be glad of the scritches too
just bephore this post saw a post that said u never know the value oph a moment until it s a memori üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•
i once flushed out a young dove out of a bush by my house by accident he sat in the grass nearby being very still so i left him alone i came back out to find him halfway down the gullet of a large black racer snake
oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck bird probably the whole time you were petting it
he had a concussion most likely flew into a window i ve seen this same behavior on birds that have flown into our windows we ve had starlings sparrows one woodpecker and a finch collide with our bathroom window because it faces the bathroom where mom put her birdfeeder they just sit and blink can usually pick them up and hold them and they do nothing if their injuries aren t too severe then a few minutes later they start cheeping then they take off if it lasts longer than minutes they might be too damaged and will need to be taken to a specialist
does anyone else think that‚Äôs the big red bird from angry birds
it s a signal from god the cardinals are going to the world series
make sure there isn t any stupid person s housecat lurking around waiting to pounce on your little friend
i saw one of these on my campus a few days ago it s very beautiful up close i had to double take when i looked the second time i pulled out my phone to catch a picture of it and it flew away
alex i ll take things a catholic priest might say for
that s a cardinal but it s also baby blue jay season there will be adorable baby blue jays bouncing around on the ground learning how to explore and fly i saw three today apparently they aren t necessarily in trouble it can just take them or so days to get flying figured out they should have a parent around keeping an eye out and feeding them
when birds knock themselves silly on things they ll just sit there and you can pick them up and move them somewhere safe until they snap out of it my mother found one in the middle of the road picked him up and brought him home we put him in a birdcage we had outside and she went to work i watched him just sit there for like minutes then he literally shook his head and started losing his shit don t worry i let him go as soon as i saw he was better
i was always told cardinals are a loved one coming to check up on you hope it was a loved one checking on you and just made an oopsie and flew into the window
i bird let me do that once and then it fucking died
a bird let me do that once and then it fucking died
a bird let me do that once and then it fugging died
i found a small sparrow outside my shop he let me pick him up and everything then flew out my hand then the next week i picked up a turtle from the middle of the road an relocated him to some near by water i felt like snow white that week good times
i found a small sparrow outside my shop he let me pick him up and everything then flew out my hand then the next week i picked up a turtle from the middle of the road and relocated him to some near by water i felt like snow white that week good times
tifu by sitting in some human s driveway and getting so scared i let them pet me
birds knock themselves out all the time not even on clear windows had a few birds crash head first into my parent‚Äôs green shed most were knocked out and i just put them in a box with some warm towels and some water out on the balcony and once they woke up and recovered they‚Äôd fly off then there was the cockatoo who crashed into knocked himself silly so i put him in the box he latched onto the stick i was using to get him to stand on with his beak and wouldn‚Äôt let go so i lifted him up by his beak and put him in the box that way once he recovered he stayed around and took to destroying the shed one bite at a time strong grudge
i am not a expert or anything but that is an angry bird
this particular bird is not very good with glass their strong suite is blocks of wood source angry birds
u amountainbound i ll be just as stunned as this guy when i set my eyes on a certain someone too üòâ
‚Äúthey only come to the surface when they are sick or dying‚Äù
you should never touch a cardinal they can explode and cause serious bodily harm source i have played a lot of angry birds
i waited for this video to load like a full min then realized its a picture
i m just imagining the face of someone who s not aware of the dog and opens that hatch
the dog even has little cup holders so it can have food and water on the go
that s perfect my friend with a saint bernard needs to see this
shouldn t he be secured with a full frontal he ll be launched into the dashboard
it‚Äôs cute but i‚Äôd be afraid of the trunk crumpling if they were rear ended
this is how dopinder‚Äôs brother died in deadpool trunks aren‚Äôt safe man
doggo s favorite spot when traveling appears to be not getting in the car
in many countries there are myths about tapirs eating the skin off people of course this isn‚Äôt true but many third world places have started killing them off
it imprinted on u bro better stay away from that poor fellow for its benefit only
worked with these guys at the zoo i volunteered at super chill you can basically put them to sleep by scratching their foreheads
if he could talk his voice would for sure be all nasally
gotta admit i half expected mama tapir to come crashing through the bush and try to stomp that guy
i love when dogs sniff a camera and the mic picks it up i now also love with tapirs sniff a camera and the mic picks it up
so sweet and beautiful it was so weird some dust blew in my eyes as i watched this
men aren‚Äôt supposed to cry men aren‚Äôt supposed to cry shutter breathing
i m not a fan of kids and babies myself but that s an amazing thing to see you can just imagine all the neurons in this kids brain just lighting up
you know what‚Äôs the neat thing about your baby‚Äôs first words you realize they‚Äôve actually been talking for a while but you didn‚Äôt realize it
how do they tell when a baby may be deaf or have trouble hearing
he knows exactly what s going on he doesn t need to know the meaning of his mum s words he knows
"i need one of those i cant hear with my left ear since i was young
now i‚Äôm even used to"
even in low resolution i can feel the judgment in his eyes
i was thinking wow what a cool painting but then it wasn t
is this your image can i use it as my tumblr user photo
right in the middle of it all i see big pink balls and now that s all i see
i‚Äôm not exaggerating when i say i‚Äôd travel miles just to meet this goodest boy
let him celebrate outside that poor beautiful floor
he wants to pretend like he is hunting it and killing it before eating it
this make me think the owner has not given him something before when he wanted it he waited until he had it completely in his possession before doing the dance
that s so cute wish the happy dance i do when i get chocolate cake was that cute p
my dogs would bury it in the backyard for months until it became floppy again
i ve seen these videos hundreds of times but i don t care i love them so much
reddit has a beehive way of thinking but i m ok with the downvotes when i know i m right
maybe he thinks he is getting his ear back that was clipped
the lil guy went from being chill to omg kjbdsakjbdjkasbdjbdkajb
my dog celebrates with me before and while im giving the treat he bows and jumps and then i carefully deposit the treat in his mouth and do a little jump which sends him into zoomies all around the livingroom before he plonks down to eat it
i cannot figure out what did you give him it looks like a wing from a giant bat üòÇ
i was thinking you could put that zelda music up when links opening any chest but i dont think it conveys enough excitement
what an adorable doggo he s so gentle the way he takes the treat watching this the first time i thought he wasn t interested in it the explosion of excitement later convinced me otherwise
my dog does this for each individual kibble we give her the bowl she just looks at us waiting for us to throw the first few kibble to initiate the joy
i may have trouble with staring at cleavage but at least i wasn t looking at the dog s balls buncha sickos
my favorite part of this is that your dog carefully takes the treat walks calmly and puts the treat down carefully and then loses his shit and starts worshiping the snack gods
so glad these vicious monsters are banned where i live s
awww it s clearly covered in something spicy or bitter this just made me sad
by dog does this with her bone however she will grab it an yeet it across the room with excitement
this melted my heart i wish a chew leather made me this happy but unfortunately they just lead to confusion and a sore jaw
super cute dog i m sure a great boi but jesus christ a giant unneutered male pit is the worst thing you can come across as a dog owner i hope to god you aren t breeding that thing given the thousand of pitts that get put down every day in shelters
be cool be cool be oh my freaking gawd look at this
my baby girl does the same thing and throws high up in the air the cutest thing ever
do you see how he doesn t take it at first and looks away that means he s submitting to the owner and waiting for approval it s really sweet
i love that at he second mark he looks at you like are you seeing this
my dog does this except she picks it up and chucks it at your head in the process it‚Äôs always a danger after giving her a new bone or a bone she‚Äôs been chewing and gets bored of
if my great dane finds a single piece of kibble out of his bowl he does this pawing and swatting at it too i just imagine him saying ‚Äúyou wanna go huh pow take that ‚Äú
i always distrust dogs that are hesitant while getting treats
people say those kinds of dogs are ugly and dumb but i really love them and they‚Äôre cute it‚Äôs how they are raised that caused them to act certain ways so good job homie
pitty has got an ear master gave it and pitty took it and pitty‚Äî pitty only misses one ear now
when he starts dancing around i hear the skyrim theme but in chonkity chonk ch ch chonk ch ch chonk ch ch chonkity chonk
you re a better dog parent than me because if that were my dog he d be the fattest on the planet
only a dog with no siblings would exhibit this behavior hahaha if there were other dogs in the house he would waste no time not leave an unsecured prize laying around while he dances
that‚Äôs not a celebration that an invitation time to play mom get in on this
she doesn t want to be fed she want s to hunt for her food
pig s ears used to give my dog the worst poops i ve ever seen
is it bad i already knew who this was going to be i love this pup in here
as soon as i saw the title i knew it would be this guy i ve seen several of his celebration videos
my dog waits patiently then when i tell him to take he ever so gently takes the treat into his mouth waits about half a second as if to say you sure this is mine and then takes off like it was stolen i can hear him thinking no takesies backsies
i like how he quietly takes it away at first it s like he didn t want to rub it in that he got a treat until he had some privacy lol
that looks like a pig ear which my greyhound used to love back in the day i d found a wholesale feed store they even had goat chow not too far from where i did my weekly grocery shopping so once a week i d buy trailways our grey some treats his favorite was what was branded as a moo tube but what was apparently a dried smoked cow esophagus anyway it was usually on saturday afternoons when i shopped and gave trai his moo tube treat but it was early saturday evenings when my husband and i had to go to work as hosts monitors for an online service trai always had to be near me so i d bring his doggy bed in the office with me and he d curl up while we worked sometime during the evening my husband would grumble g d damn my eyes are watering trai would look up at us with innocent eyes and beat his tail on the floor a few times but as the night went on even i was cringing those moo tubes that trai loved so much apparently wreaked havoc with his digestive system he never acted sick or like his tummy hurt but he did release some gastric bombs that could ve been used for chemical warfare
my dog does the same thing he also rolls on it and tosses it up in the air
my god get that vicious pit bull under control before he bites someone
what a sweet killing machine i‚Äôm going to get one for my small children
wow sure am glad i saw this while quickly scrolling through work reminded me to call the vet before they close to make an appointment for my dog
so cute we had a tradition growing up that every saturday morning we would give our dog a pig ear like that right when he got it he would head straight to the backyard where he would do a trot around the fenceline with the treat in his mouth then come back inside and eat it he had to show the world his treat damnit i miss that dog
i liked how he acting sort of disinterested as is to say well its okay i guess then flips df out
he looks over like ‚Äúi swear tim if you‚Äôre recording this‚Äù
my dog does this for bully sticks i always thought she was upset or something she ll also try to bury them she doesn t do this with any other treats toys or bones just bully sticks if this is a celebration then i m definitely going to start buying them again
that s cute and all but why do people feel the need to cut off their dogs ears
he is so sweet and gentle when he takes his treat such a good boi
whats the thing he s eating it looks strange cute reaction though
i have never been that excited about anything in my life
my dog loves those bloody things no lie it‚Äôll take her seconds to decimate that thing
he is doing the treat dance making sure to pay homage to the treat gods
lol my dog is a similair breed and he also does this when he recieves a pigs ear
there s a eared pig somewhere watching this video thinking enjoy asshole
yup this dog is well known and had multiple different videos on this sub repost nonetheless
call it celebration if you want it looks like he s trying to initiate play
ur dog has some rly nice nuts would love see them in person
i used to give my dog a few of those in a day only to realize she d bury them in the couch cushions xd
i don t seem to get reddits unhealthy obsession with dog testicles
that‚Äôs fantastic well mannered well mannered well mannered holy shit i am so excited look what i got
you have no idea if he does this every time you stole this from the other reposts
this makes me happy but idk why it remains me how of the time my cat ignored me after getting a treat i usually leave it there and when i check it again it‚Äôs gone
my dog does this but he chucks the pig s ear up in the air i always assumed he was making sure it was dead
my dog does something similar to this but he barks at his food for some reason
oh the old mighty vicious pitbulls killing humanity again
this is so great can‚Äôt wait to get home to my boy ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
my black lab does this every time he gets a cherry tomato he tosses it around for a few minutes like a doofus having the time of his life before finally eating it
when my dog does this to a pigs ear or piece of dried hide it s because he wants me to tear it up for him
adorable thanks ‚ù§Ô∏è and this is coming from a cat person
mine does this as well throws the treat around runs up to it again grabs it and sets it down jumps around throws again it‚Äôs like he‚Äôs pretending to receive it over and over
clipping your dogs ears and feeding them to him is fucked up
my dog does the exact same thing and occasionally picks the treat up just to toss it at a wall or her bed i m curious why dogs do this
im so fucking glad im not the kind of animal who sees that as a treat i would slap the fillings out your mouth you handed that to me
that look he gives during his celebration pause is the exact same look that my dog gives me when he is extremely happy and is about to jump on you he is very strong so he will knock the wind out of you
i love the pause and side eye they give you it s ok that i m freaking out ok
my pekingese chihuahua mix does a similar dance very cute
when you finally leave the meeting and you found out you got a raise
oh my goodness such a well behaved and cute dog wow
he is not celebrating he is killing it my dog used to do that a lot
or he thinks it s still alive and he s showing how adorably fierce he is
he likes it because it s the same texture as a newborn child
i love the half second where he seems to acquire a bit of self awareness before continuing to flip his shit
my guy is half pit but doesn t look it then i see pits behaving like this and i totally see the resemblance
i was told those pig ears are not good for dogs at all my dog loves them was i lied to
my parents used to have an english mastiff earl who would do this when we gave him a bone my mom used to call it dancing i would tell him to kill it ha when lbs does this its quite a site
awe what a good boy for taking the treat so gently i can almost hear him jumping around saying imma good boy imma good boy
between the thumbnail and you‚Äôre username i wasn‚Äôt sure what the hell i was getting myself into i was happily not disappointed
well yeah he s gonna celebrate after living his whole life with tiny ears he just got a giant one
my dog does this with pig ears too someone explain why
what kind of dog is that i adopted a shelter puppy and he does that exact same prance whenever he gets excited they didn t know what breed he was when we rescued him
ooh cropped ears and a pitbull shocked this thread isn‚Äôt locked
my dog usually jumps to grab a treat out of my hand and then chokes multiple times before just eating it
very inconsiderate of the treat not to play with him
this is great and as a dog owner i can smell that nasty pig ear and hear the crunch of a happy dog enjoying it
this was great really made me laugh thank you for sharing
i could have gotten k karma if i stole this video and posted it here
my dog is well mannered with food wont touch it unless i allow him but he goes nuts with these type of treats that i ve banned them inside the house lol
my dog does this and rolls on top of it as well then leaves the thing alone won‚Äôt eat it
he celebrated after the treat he is stream snipping
you say always but i only see one clip gonna need more footage
sorry if this has been said already i‚Äôm on mobile where do i get my good boy a big treat like that
slide to the right take it back now y all cha cha real smooth
i already know how these are going to go and i always love them anyways üôÇüôÇ
imagine how creepy this would look if it was a dried dog eat instead
that s not a celebration that s a ritual dance for the old gods
i needed to smile today and this made me smile thank you
lol my pibble does this too gets close then throws her head back like whaaaaaat then dances around it
oh heckin heck the bestest boy gets a heckin good treat
don t know why i m smiling like an idiot right now so freak n cute
my dog does the same thing but with his kibble whenever he‚Äôs feeling playful he toss it and chase it around üòÖ cutest thing
that good boy is gonna have stinky breath after that treat
that hesitation what did i do to deserve this am i really a good boy
ah yes the classic ritual praying for more good boy treats
i was gong to assume you didn‚Äôt clip his ears but got him like that then i saw the balls and realized you don‚Äôt care about being humane
i think he must be a little confused like human s have good stuff all the time and i m not allowed to touch it this must be a trick or a test or something
i would too if someone gave me a treat the size of my head
my dog always used to do this every morning when we gave her a piece of bread we thought she just liked to fight against it simulating fighting against her prey she passed away early this year her name was nova thank you for your post it reminded me so much how much i loved her
our lab does the same every time he gets a special treat as if he cannot believe it i think he doesn t know what to do with that
for the love of all that s holy dog owners no hardwood floors look at those poor paws slipping when he s tryna eat that stuff
i can hear that sound of paws on lamimate floor when i watch this
is this that same dog that got that spiral looking treat out of the bag and did the same thing
awww my japanese chin doggo does this too with any milk bone treats i call it the bone dance
this is too funny i just want to kiss that dog metaphorically
guys wtf is this treat is this meat of some sort it s driving me crazy for the last months since this meme debutted
why do dogs so often take things so gently like that
this is absolutely precious and hilarious thank you so much for sharing
too bad the ears are clipped that‚Äôs a pretty fucked up thing to do to a dog
this seems too salty for a dog or is it appropriate vets of reddit help me on
i think that‚Äôs the sacrificial dance to the pig ear gods
i smiled the widest smile i ve ever thought i could
is he perhaps trained by muay thai monk s reminds me of the spiritual dance ritual muay thai fighters do before battle starts
his ig is brutusthabully he does this with every treat he gets gets me every time
what you didn t realize was that treat was haunted and he s just trying to scare the ghosts out
this cracks me up every time i see it i had a friend with a french bulldog that was very trained to not beg for treats from the table or any time else the trainer guy said it was important once started to catch on to offer treats at certain times im sure thats the case here that dog looked at it and wasnt sure he took it very gently to make sure it was really happening and once he was sure its the same exact behavior my friends dog would do he would race through the house with it throw it around and eventually settle down for a nice quiet chew
wouldn t it have been better to just let him keep the ears he had
my gds dose the same thing when he gets a pig ear however he worn start chewing on it for about a day
do me a favor and don‚Äôt give one of those to a dog on a long car trip
it s like all of his thoughts that fired off in his brains while he was awaiting the treat needed to be expressed before he could proceed further
awwww my dog always has to jump up on my lap and give me kisses to say thank you after i feed her it is very special and it warms my heart
this just assures that he gets more treats who wouldn t want to see that all the time
this doggo is doing it right reminds me to be more grateful
wow that s adorable i live doggies this makes me want to get one i ve had them all through my yeara growing up
stop clipping dogs ears it‚Äôs disturbing animals are beautiful the way they are
your dog is awesome i had a pitbull that would do the same if we gave her favourite treat she‚Äôd run around the whole backyard like that celebrating
i m ricky bobby if you don t like dogs then f k you
my dog always does this when given a treat and i have no idea what it means i thought it was a dog s version of the river dance for celebrating
our dog does the same thing except your is much cuter cuz he‚Äôs wayyyy bigger lol
this like when a new game comes out that i want i run to put it in and install then run around the house excited for like minutes
my dog is half pit and does the same thing i almost have to shove the treat in her mouth because her little brain is overwhelmed then she ll lay it down and just go apeshit dogs are wonderful
not only is this a repost the comments are like recomments fuck reddit
this is the funniest and most precious clip ive seen in a while
super cute but they lopped his ears instead of his balls you re doin it wrong
that doggo s food rituals never fail to make my day
that perspective i at first thought that was a whole slab of meat also is this your dog op was he a rescue he seems so tentative about getting a treat like he s expecting a double cross
that dog has trust issues he think the owner is gonna take it away
for the small price of a pig s ear i will show you the dance of my people
its like hes playing with a ghost dog or maybe the pigs spirit xd
part of me thinks he s kinda celebrating but also kinda indulging his unconscious instinct to fight with and or kill his food in the absence of having to do so
ah pig ears my dog loved those things would run around the room when he got one and then just chill for like an hour chewing on it
i appreciate that this dog didn t count his egg before it hatched he wanted to make sure he could declare ownership before reacting something tells me he s been burned in the past p
that was great i hope one day to have something that makes me that happy even if only for a little while
my dog just snatched the treat runs to consume it on my bed and runs back hoping for some of my breakfast
slipknot playing during the celebration enhanced my experience

in the beginning dog oh what s this thank you acting calm as soon as you turn your back dog yipee i worship my treats
looks at his ears in a mirror what is this funny to you
well i guess he‚Äôs just stoked to finally have an ear
kirby‚Äôs celebration dances after beating a boss anyone
thank you kind sir now please excuse me as i step aside here for a moment yes hells yeaaaa
he‚Äôs just pleased to see a full ear after his were lopped off
not sure where you re from but those are no longer on the market in indiana because many dog s have died from a blockage because those don t digest well our dog was lucky and was able to throw it up but it was in whole pieces not saying this will happen to your dog but just sharing as a precaution beautiful pup though
my god this is the best fucking cherry to mark the end of the work week
he s doing a ritual stop him before he completes it
mine does that too but i always thought she was hunting it she plays with the cat toys nearly the same way
i love how he gives you a little side eye mid celebration like ‚Äùnow you‚Äôre sure you don‚Äôt want this right ‚Äù
that tail revving up right as the dog takes the treat is just too adorable
god i wish my dog took treats that nicely i gotta step my game up
bruh i think this is a bully thing my american bully does the same thinggggg
must dance around toy to praise the gods for this offering
his balls are still attached that s the real reason he s so happy
how is this dog not over weight that‚Äôs the cutest thing iv ever seen i would give it a treat every hour
my dog almost choked and died on a pig ear one night consistantly coughing until we took him to the vet to realize it was still stuck in his throat be careful
god damn i‚Äôve seen this posted a million times across all forms of social media for months now
that isn t celebrating he is showing you how he will attack you if you stop giving him treats he is a beautiful dog
every dog i ve had have this reaction when given pig s ears well one of them got so scared of it he peed himself when he was a puppy first time seeing another dog freak out about it as much as mine have done i miss them all
that look halfway through what are you still doing here human
at least she s feeding him is own ears waste not want not
the only way to explain the level of cute this is is that it s illegal
i m curious on what animal meat that is xd chicken etc
can someone explain why dogs act like that toward their treat lol
what a beautiful dog look at that square face an absolute cutie pie
was cute for all of one second before i noticed it was a pigs ear
the cutest thing in the world is when they re sitting down and they have no traction on their front paws and they just keep sliding and readjusting
i call bs on this i think that poor dog was always denied a treat or had it taken away after being given you can see it is so afraid to take it and when it took it it walked away slowly after putting it down realized he finally got it
this is what my dog does with anything i give her new bone this rawhide piece this banana this she also rolls all over it so i m sure you can imagine how quick i get to her when she pushes the banana into the carpet being excited
is it just me or does this dog look like gordon ramsay
i don t know one dog that doesn t like a good pig ear
ok so this is happening just act cool for sec might not be me ok it for me nom ohhhhh yeeeaaa boiiiiiii
it s like you are being rewarded for giving him a treat he s training you also that s a frigging cute doggo keep giving him those treats
you shouldn t let your dog take things out of your hands
oh goshum this is gud stuff r u sure u sure okay i take party time
this is definitely one of the best vids about and have watched it more times than i can remember smiles all round
oh my goodness our dog willow does the same thing all i have to do is say easy and she gently grabs it sets it down then just dances and dances gonna giver her a treat and a belly rub when i get home thank you
tonight i shall feast like a king but first i do the happy dance of my people
this is like the fifth time i ve seen this dog on the frontpage and i am not complaining
imagine the celebration he has when he gets the ultimate treat a toddlers face
my old dog rip loved pig ears except he would spend literally hours finding a good place to hide bury them sometimes in the spring planting something in the garden i‚Äôd find an old soggy moldy pig ear and he would still take the thing and bury it somewhere else so fun to watch him walk around the yard and the neighbors tardy trying to find the perfect spot
he‚Äôs trying so hard to play it cool but he‚Äôs got the absolute worst poker tail i‚Äôve ever seen
looks like that good buddy gets reasons to celebrate on the regular ol chunkamonk
i‚Äôve never thought of it as a celebration before my dog does this sometimes but i perceived it more so as wanting to kill the treat before eating it ha
that little side look like you won t judge me will you human
is that the part of his ears you had chopped off to make him look tough
here s the rest of your left ear that owner probably
i have an itching suspicion that the dog wants you to try and take the treat
oh boy the pig s ear is a brave choice incoming wall of dog farts
i believe they are imaginary play fighting with their siblings the way they remember doing
my dog flips out like this when i give him his dental chew
yeah the ever popular pigs ear treats we stopped giving our doggos this when we realized what terrible dog gas was emitted following owners beware
and if i blink giving my dog a treat it s gone like magic maybe my hand as well
is that for me am i really allowed to have that are you sure you re actually letting me have this whole thing really seems a little too good to be true really i have your full permission yeah definitely yeah fuck yeah holy shit ohmagawhd this is fucking awesome im the shit yeaaahhhhh
i used to buy those for a dog i had about years ago stink to all hell i just buy rawhide for my current pup
every time i gave a pig ear to my beagle it was immediately defcon you couldn t get anywhere near him until he finished that shit he thought the whole world was trying to take his pig ear he would not listen to reason only happened with pig ears
how do you teach a dog to be gentle like this i can t think of any way to teach them that
actually he s having a seizure a common occurrence in this type of breed s
jesus dog shows more gratitude than my spoiled son where did i go wrong
be cool stay calm oh shit i think it s mine yeah it s actually for me keep coooooool daaaaaaaance muthafucka
before my dog went deaf if you said pig ear she would flip shit those things are delicacies
itt people encourage op to chop the dog s balls off while simultaneously being mad that he cropped its ears actual irony is rare to see but it s glorious
every post that has a dog with balls and cropped ears turns into a moral echo chamber don t even get me started on the people debating whether or not a specific dog is a pitbull pitbull is not an actual breed of dog it is a mix of any type of dog that brings about certain physical characteristics one quote says ‚Äúpeople say you know a pit bull when you see one but do you really ‚Äù asked lisa peterson spokeswoman for the american kennel club which tracks pedigrees of dogs back to rather than a specific breed pit bull is more of a generic term to describe a group of dogs with similar characteristics ‚Äî much as are ‚Äúhound‚Äù and ‚Äúterrier‚Äù ‚Äî and encompasses both mixes and pure bred dogs pit bull is not a breed it is only the way the dog looks a dog that looks like a pitbull can have many different combinations of lineage anyways just enjoy the damn dog having fun my god
my newfie used to do the same thing with his dog biscuits we called it the cookie dance
my dog gets almost exactly the same treats and he does exactly this with it it s adorable every single time
i want to upvote this to infinity and beyond one upvote is not nearly enough for this amount of heart overflow
this is the canine equivalent of an endzone celebration
good boy likes play time with the dead animal treaty
omg i always had to tear treats up too help my pup slow down an enjoy the moment why is it raining in my apartment
my dog did the same thing with pig ears then he‚Äôd hide them
every time this dog is just so happy why can t i feel that
oh my gosh most adorable thing i‚Äôve seen today thank you for sharing
what a happy pup these kinds of videos can make the worst day into the best day ever
is it just me or does that dog treat low key looks like another dog s ear just saying they say it s a pig ear but they also said that it was america was the first to walk on the moon its the matrix all over again smh
what an awesome dog not trying to rain on the parade or anything but our dog got really sick with giardia and the vet said it was likely because of the pig s ear we gave him just something to consider i wouldn t want it to happen to anyone else
i love this kind of dog is the american pit bull terrier
my little dog does this too she does it with her dinner as well will like pick up a piece of kibble and place it on the floor then do this around it tiny happy growls included she has done it so offten that now i say get it tink or fuck it up tink and she goes even more insane so happy over foodies
how could people fear pitbulls they are the pinnacle of cuteness omg
so i feel like whenever a dog does stuff like this it s always unhealthy behavior that it shouldn t be doing if this totally fine and dandy for us to awww at or is this some sort of unbalanced behavior
he s very thankful aware of the situation in africa how all his doggy cousins don t have those treats
i love how he humbles himself like thank you i couldn t accept this
animals expressing joy are always fun to watch we ll give the cats raw chicken wings from time to time and when the burmese realises they re being handed out she ll start talking she rarely speaks and going bowl to bowl waiting for the wings to be dispensed then there s a routine where the other cats have to wait until she s excitedly checked out all of the wings in the bowls if they try to eat the wing before she s finished the routine they get shoved out of the way
that s awesome i have two dogs but if the big one ever did that the little would ve stolen the treat before the big guy got halfway through the dance
it took him a second to pick up on the baby guts scent
are you giving him the ears that you cutted out from him so he can look cooler for you
dude my pit does the same thing with bully sticks pits are weird haha
my old dog used to love pig ears and i would have such a fun time as a kid hiding from him as he looked for me to give him his treat thanks for reminding me of that
oh my gosh what a sweetheart those tippy taps of celebration are the best thing i‚Äôve seen in a while
look at this violent bully take out his hate for babies on the floor beyonce said it right you re indespicable
our lab pirelli does something similar but keeps the treat bone in his mouth when he does it it s called the bone dance
our lab pirelli does something similar but keeps the treat bone in his mouth when he does it it s called the bone dance
my dogs always enjoyed these the simple joys of life
i mean well you are feeding an ear to a dag that had it ears chopped off
lol watched the video only noticed the bong sitting on table
my chiweenie does this with his food sometimes except he‚Äôll take a slightly larger kibble amp celebrate like this eat it then resume eating
awesome my dog does this too i had no idea other dogs danced with their treats
it s like me driving home after having picked up the big slice cut pizza i ordered just for myself
i hate to break this to you but that is not a celebration your dog is apart of the cult and that is a ritual
i hate to break this to you but that is not a celebration your dog is apart of the and that is a ritual
i hate to break this to you but that is not a celebration your dog is apart of the and that is a
i hate to break it to you but that is not a celebration your dog is apart of a cult and that is a ritual
this is the fucking sweetest thing i‚Äôve seen in years ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è

if he always does it then let s see a couple more videos of you giving him treats
k upvotes do you know how many times this was reposted its like the fifth time i see it on this subreddit alone where is that karmadecay bot
this is the absolute cutest thing i‚Äôve seen all day bless that pups heart ‚ù§Ô∏è
mine takes that long to eat the thing i turn my head and it s gone
there is a lot of bottled up enjoyment if it can t be released when getting the treat it must be released after it
this dog has better manners than most people so restrained
taking pleasure in the small things i‚Äôm going to try this happy dance when i eat my morning muffin
how does one train a dog not to be aggressive when accepting treats
you clip the dogs ears at a young age then give it the gift of a full ear what a sick insult üòÑ
this is a nice celebration of this cute dog and this dog is so good dancer too he is dancing to get the treat it is so funny
i am watching this with do you know by enrique playing in bg lol seemed like your dog was dancing to the song s beat hahahaha
this makes me think of crash bandicoot getting a gem for some reason
i needed this you do not know how much i needed this i was crying in pain a few hours ago and now i m crying happy tears i wanna live just for these moments whoever this good boy is may he light up a million more lives with his happiness
but why did the dog play cool when he got his treat
click click click click screech clickety clackety clickety clackety
staffys are the best dogs i have and love them dearly
i love that dog so excited to get a treat and yet takes it so gently my pitbull is also super gentle taking treats she isn t active like that though since she only has three legs
the dog seems so sweet it is such a shame his owners felt the need to cut his ears off and almost entirely too
we need to get this to k dont let the flame die out were almost there
i squealed out loud when they started jumping around like that the sweetest thing a very good dog
amazing how we generate the dog and hate the pig sickening really
every time i give my dog a treat he does the same thing and it‚Äôs adorable
fun skunk facts skunks instinctively follow their mothers and they learn how to find food by watching her since these skunks don t have a mother we are pretending to be their mom and they follow us around until they find food skunks don t know how to spray when they are this small and they will be released once they are big enough to spray
my brother in law had one they are also great mousers
the one with the white fuzzy tail ‚ù§Ô∏è i want a baby skunk so badly

i can t figure out why but something is really off about the feet in this picture that rear right one the raised one it looks disconnected and photo shopped on i think it s just an artefact of the running being captured but i can t not notice it amp x b also beautiful horse
legit thought the horse pissed this and was talking about the human beside them
legit thought the horse posted this and was talking about the human beside them
how is sarah jessica parker doing anyway pretty cool you all are homies
that s pretty cool how is sarah jessica parker doing nowadays
there s something about this picture almost like an optical illusion that makes the whole thing look super photoshopped but when you look at each piece individually it s fine weird
how do you type with hooves talk to text i guess hey
pretty amazing how a horse can type like this kudos
can op please recreate this photo of him running in terror
i d like to request that you retake this photo with you running in front of the horse with a look of abject terror on your face
am i the only one getting dog jumping in grass flashbacks
uh how did you type this out with your hooves clearly a fake post
i cried from the beauty i m getting a little horse here i ll leave now
oh ho you the horse i don t want ti be rude buy how did you managed to have an account on reddit take a picture of you and your hooman and wrote a post that s amazing wordefull nature
this is a nice post to see after seeing the post about the horse dying right after finishing a race also the comments on that post are just a shitsjow
i realize i don t know the normal lifespan of a horse
is anyone else upset that not all the dogs names are there or did anyone else zoom to see the good puppies names
obviously the one with bow tie on is the real stud here
i want to know if anyone asked then to sign their yearbook
this wasn‚Äôt a thing when i was in high school i wonder if it would have helped
see if we let people take away our guns we wouldn t get cute stuff like this
by every high school kid is going to have a dog in class
k upvotes comments had to check this wasn t gallowboob
these are the faces of the people who voted for an abortion ban notice something not a single woman
i m concerned that no one is talking about how many therapy dogs this school needs we need responsible gun control
the black one looks so cute with his tongue hanging out i just want to cuddle
wow okay all i see is good boyes and good gurls but damn why did that hansome boye have to stunt on everyone with a bowtie
i am really sad these dogs were needed but i am glad they were there
there is both beauty and horror in this children shouldn‚Äôt have to have esa‚Äôs for mass ptsd i am glad that these esa‚Äôs were available to them
why are there so many kids that need therapy dogs it seems disproportionate or is this some kind of special school
that is a lot of therapy dogs i went to high school years ago with roughly students and there was exactly student who needed a dog this seems excessive
what expensive kind of high school did u go to i mean i graduated years ago and my school was private and where are my therapy dogs haha but tbh my school still was tiny so that meant a smaller budget
i m concerned about people with pet allergies i ve had asthma caused by pet allergies all my life and if a dog is ever in the same building i lose lung capacity and my eyes swell up it s a lot worse if the dog has been living with a cat maybe therapy classes could be an elective as well i remember a class for this purpose in grade school all the breweries and gyms have dogs living in them too i m cursed with allergies and jealous
i must know this good boi‚Äôs name i am so so proud of him
i finally get why people do this after killing others in battlefield games
i watched this without sound and imagine the ackackackack from mars attacks when he opens his beak
pretty sure that s parrot for i threw it on the ground
this woman is absolutely precious find joy in the simple things
why the hell did she not use gloves yay for grandma‚Äôs cool hair but those hands
this made me tear up a little she looks like my incredible grandmother and had a similar reaction to when she found out she was going to be a great grandmother to my kid
i am slowly going grey as most mid lifers tend to do i actually can‚Äôt wait until i‚Äôm all grey since it will make dying my hair funky colors easier i‚Äôm a brunette so i need to bleach my hair out
the bright side is that the old woman will have her hands green all their life from now one
the amount of old ladies i see with brightly colored hair has been increasing lately and i love it
i dont care how often its reposted still makes the day better
repost i remember reading all the hate comments from the original
she‚Äôs so happy let‚Äôs all be completely honest she looks fabulous i want hair like that
she‚Äôs adorable her reaction was so cute may she live long and prosper aw gosh i miss my grandma
i m sitting at the bar with tears in my eyes and a large smile i hope no one is watching
seeing her smile and bounce made me do the same i love her
how many subs will i see this reposted in must really bring that karma
this will be me when i‚Äôm a little old lady and finally decide to dye my hair blue i‚Äôve always wanted to but responsibilities keep me from doing it
thumbnail looks like a woman choking a maengs chicken def better than watching porn gifs
this is exactly what i wanna do when my hair turns gray white i love crazy hair colors but i also got dark hair that takes ages to bleach and i m broke as hell so i don t dye it but when your hair is already white you can just go and dye it whatever fun colour you want without having to worry about bleaching and how damaging that is to your hair not to mention expensive so when i m a tiny granma i want to have crazy ass rainbow coloured hair like this rad lady lt
it‚Äôs sweet and all but do i have to see this video four times a day
she‚Äôs acting like a kid on christmas sniff i love it
i love when old people have dyed hair they always look so happy about it
i want to be her when i grow up shes so excited she jumping
so i guess the girl who dyed her hair didn‚Äôt think it was a good idea to wear gloves willing to bet her hands were stained for a week at least
she is so fucking cute i sincerely hope everyone gets the opportunity to find so much happiness in small joys like this
she looks like shes again and got a box of chocolates for christmas

well at least it‚Äôs been a few weeks since i‚Äôve seen this reposted
bless your kindred soul this may be the first time i‚Äôve seen this posted without it being called a freaking warthog
this has been posted here so often that it has lost all its cuteness power to me
i know these animals are super destructive and super aggressive but i ll be damned if that s not the cutest baby i ve ever seen
they re wonderful and fit perfectly in the crock pot

i m going to my psychiatrist right now to ask for a prescription
this gif is further proof people will complain about anything possible there was nothing controversial about this yet so many crybabies
i only need a mood stabilizer dimethicone pills melatonin levomepromazine and propavan sleeping meds
i have this but the last page says insulin and also lexapro
i was kinda hoping that the last picture would be a picture of pills cute but a wee vapid
i just picture him sitting there common just lick the hole for the video
i hope its a dog i hope it s a dog i hope it s a dog that man s a genius
because of my unemployment lack of money and my schizophrenia getting worse and worse this is an accurate view of the kind of medicine i can have at the moment
i knew it was coming still better than expected also damn am i the only one here that doesn t take daily meds
perfect as that‚Äôs the only medicine covered under my health insurance plan
funny the only medicine i need is my actual fucking medicine that you know helps me not want to kill myself helps stop my chronic migraines and helps with the debilitating pain i get from my endometriosis cuddles with my cat are great but they‚Äôre not as life saving as you might think
i doubt a flip book of me taking zoloft would have the same effect
i needed this bless you and you flipbook creating human
yeah i don‚Äôt need antidepressants gt proceeds to hurt myself and others around me
great a novelty account that basically just wastes paper
that freaked me out for some reason just trying to figure out what the hell was going on
what breed of dog is this one just found one that looks exactly like it yesterday
i m in the hospital missing my fur babies so much this reminds me of what i m trying to get better for it was a very funny sad moment üòÇ
all the upvotes are really depressing it‚Äôs minimizing those of us who actually need meds your ableism is showing
and if you need the tablets too that s ok this is a cute video but if i didn t take my meds regularly i wouldn t be able to function if you re in that camp too don t feel ashamed for needing a boost
man imagine opening your prescription medication bottle you go to tip one into your hand but your bottle just starts licking you
laughs in medications i take so i can breathe not kill my self vaguely function
omg he s having a heart attack quick someone get him a dog so that he can get his face licked oh no it didn t work i have no idea how this could ve gonne wrong
the cap on that bottle isn‚Äôt childproof and would be considered hazardous by the fda
my issue is it gives out a negative message about anti depressants which do help
i was kinda very sure that it was going to be a fleshlight not disappointed though
just here to say that if you need actual medicine that s okay there s no shame in not being able to do it all by yourself with man s best friend
when you re trying to enjoy the video but all you can think about is their username
my mom should have scraped me out of her fucking uterus when she had the chance
you re blindfolded and you feel a wet fleshy object rub against your cheek
this is cute but fuck the i don t need pills mindset okay technically that wording is fine you don t need pills but it heavily heavily implies that other shouldn t either it contributes to people keeping quiet about medication and not discussing it in a healthy open manner
i am sure that if god exists he made dogs to cheer us up
a lot of you seen this is a bash on depression and other such mental illnesses but it is not it was simply an innocent gif and i apologize if i hurt any of you
watch out minutes will save you or more on car insurance

doggone it did i drop my keys in here dig dig dig shit wait i don t have keys ok naptime
you have no proof it was him the way i see it it could‚Äôve been anyone
great pyrenees know how to look shameful when ours got older she had a harder time controlling herself and would have accidents a bunch whenever she did she would hide in a corner looking shameful poor thing we never really got made at her she couldn t help it
cuteness he s acting guilty because he knows you will be upset about the mess not because he feels bad about what he did so eager to please you but he thought that was so much fun to dig
what is going through their mind when they do that is it like they are in a trance and snap out of it going ‚Äúoh my god what have i doonnneee ‚Äù

i‚Äôm very sorry for your loss looks like you gave the good boi a very happy life and you can always take comfort and pride in that
sadly he doesn‚Äôt like to be cuddled at least while he‚Äôs not sleeping
good boy douglas fuck yeah keep doin what you‚Äôre doin
not yet full ear flop yet it seems i love shepherd pups for this reason their ears outgrow their bodies the same way that paws often outgrow their bodies and they go from fully soft to fully standing up so it ends with these comically over sized super floppy ears and it s the cutest
not to discredit the cuteness but i just gotta say this good boi looks like he just threw up and is very confused about it
what breed is he because we have a dog that looks like him that‚Äôs a german shepherd and husky mix
eeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrsssssssssss
this is the first google image result for german shepard puppy

you know if you re gonna repost someone else s pet you could at least come up with your own title
my one dog is the opposite she‚Äôs all waggy waggy with anticipation before you pet her and then the moment that you touch her she stops wagging
can we wait like more than a week to repost someone else‚Äôs post
this is either false advertising or a defective snootinator the tail starts to wag just before the snoot is booped
it s been days since the original post came out wait at least a week please
i can literally watch this all day am i the only one
my pupper is the same but with tummy chest petting he throws the biggest tantrums of we stop petting him his a spoiled good boy ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§

so happy that you were there for that mama kitty to find üòä
look at those adorable little hellspawns congrats on your adoption and becoming a grandparent all in the same minutes
i am having trouble counting heads there is it or bubs
something highly similar happened to me about years ago it s so weird how some female cats will pick out a human and just say whelp that s my hoooman he s going to help me raise these kittens whether he likes it or not today mom and all kittens ya looking at you full grown fat boys and little slim grey girl are all doing well and it turns out i couldn t split up the family try as i may so all of them are still with me and in fact they re sleeping their lazy cat butts right here on the desk as i type this
look at those tiny fuzzballs i love them keep them away from me because theyre not safe with me gosh i love them so much
we adopted a cat from my friend who was leaving and couldn‚Äôt bring her with the day before we were supposed to pick her up my friend texted and said kitty had gotten into a fight so she had some scratches went and got her the next day and brought her home about a month later my husband said ‚Äúyou know meow meow is looking sort of like a burrito a pregnant burrito ‚Äù sure enough we could feel little babies moving around inside she had four kittens in my husband‚Äôs side of the closet üòÇ we ended up keeping two and giving the other two to friends meow meow got out about a year later and never came home but six years later we still have our two fat fur babies
had a similar experience about years ago my mom caught a pregnant cat at her church and brought it home the cat was extremely young and small i would say she just got to the age she could get pregnant we were going to take her to the humane society the next day but apparently she wasn t having that and at am she popped them out and for the next few hours we scrambled to wing cat birth thankfully everything went well and the kittens of which there were of somehow and mother were fine we still have the mother but gave the kittens away at a local flea market
welp she chose you those are generally the best pets
i‚Äôve never given any awards before but this was totally worth purchasing some coins and giving a gold this brightened my day thank you
i like how the cat considered you not a threat and a safe option
thank you for taking in this beautiful girl and her babies üíú as someone who has trapped and fixed over feral cats i can assure you she‚Äôs not feral feral cats will fling themselves up walls to get away from humans hurting themselves and whoever they need to to get away
wow they are so tiny about how big are the kittens a couple inches long ive had dogs that had puppies but ive never seen a newborn kitten before
wow soooo adorable i hope you‚Äôll adopt mama cat at least kittens are easier to adopt
it‚Äôs not feral just a stray a feral would never just come up to you
i have that same blanket i m glad its twin is holding such precious beans hats off to you good human üé©üé©
that cat is looking at you like i hope your fucking cool man
female tabbies are one of the sweetest cats you can have she‚Äôll be a bundle of love
is she feral or just homeless she looks pretty tame in the pic feral afraid of humans
i‚Äôve always wondered why there‚Äôs never a father cat
i‚Äôm so glad she found a kind hooman thank you for the kitten pic
so sweet question of curiosity for cat experts is this a normal behavior for cats to seek out human help if they‚Äôre either in pain or about to give birth
it s so awesome that you helped this mama cat make sure you contact a local shelter about getting her and the kittens fixed when they re able a lot of places will do it for free
where are you located if even its a hour drive from ny then i would like to adopt one
i‚Äôm curious does she want to stay inside now now she‚Äôs given birth or is she trying to drag her babies back outside
just a quick question there‚Äôs this cat outside that i don‚Äôt own but pet almost every other day and feed everyday he‚Äôs really dirty so i feel bad but when is it okay to give a stray purr a home
make sure to check if she s chipped before you keep her
that s great you ve made friends for as long as you want i had a similar thing happen when i was living with a friend over a decade ago separate outdoor cats one day after the other started meowing desperately to come inside at night in the cold of winter not normal for either community cat i let them in they found a place had kittens and i thoroughly enjoyed being submerged in little healthy kittens as much as i could amazing time still have my previous scout
how was she acting that you knew she was having contractions of all my time spent with animals in my life i ve somehow never been around a pregnant one
that cat has a look on her face like hey thanks for help with the kids now what s for lunch
it s weird how cats or animals in need seek out humans for help i came home one night and saw a cat in my lot right around the corner from two different people who were outside he didn t want them though he came to me as soon as i got out of my car he could have been helped long before but he picked me instead they pick their humans and we just have to give in and help
she has placed her trust in you dont mess it up also i have that same walmart blanket and i also use mine for freeloading cats
god bless you please message if you need support to help those kittens and mama cat i don‚Äôt have much but if you need a few bucks i‚Äôll apple cash it to you god bless you again thank you for several reasons
you should let the mom take care of the kittens including relocating them if that‚Äôs what she‚Äôs trying to do it stresses them out to be overruled and they will abandon their kittens generally not a good idea to handle the kittens too much too although this is very hard to do
sometimes i wonder just how many people own a cat because a stray cat simply thought well i like this place and you seem to be in desperate need of a roommate i m moving in
definitely not feral probably just a stray but yay my cat just had kittens too üòç
happened to me as well almost ten years ago she had two kittens right in my closet kept mama and daughter and gabe brother to a friend love them
just so you know a nursing cat should be fed kitten food since it has extra nutrients that that a nursing cat needs
congratulations on your cat lady stater kit you re a good man bran stark voice one serious piece of advice get them all neutered asap
as someone who has two feral cats thank you for being there for her they aren t easy cats to care for but they re incredibly rewarding
you are an angel there is going to be a special place in heaven for you
this is amazing i‚Äôm currently helping nurse new kitties without a mother they love you üòä
i too have a former stray tiger stripe mamma kitty very similar circumstances to your story my girl is getting up there in years but she really turned in to the sweetest cat she was once so fierce now she makes biscuits every night
i work at a recycling plant we have about feral cats that feast on rats old food and whoever gets to the cat food i put out first some of them are kind of shit moms because i‚Äôve had to pull countless kittens from extremely dangerous machinery this week i guess the mom just rolled out or got killed somehow i found kittens and had died i was no more good but i managed to get someone who bottle feeds to pick up the rest they used to have trappers that came in to spade and neuter not sure where they‚Äôve been
a feral cat would avoid humans especially if she were about to give birth this is a kitty that lost her home and found a new one
i kinda did this to my bf but on purpose because i knew she was pregnant and i know a lot of the local shelters will euthanize kittens she was so tiny and a stray so he was sure it would only be two kittens it was
my wife has a cat that absolutely hates me when she was having contractions she was the sweetest cat ever and let me pet her once the babies were born same thing she was so proud and let me touch them pet her once they grew up she was the spawn of darkness and her boys are friendly
my mother adopted a cat from the spca she was told it was a male until she saw the cat rolling around on her back and two big toms staring at her so kitty gave birth to three kittens inside their clothes closet and it was so much fun afterwards for my parents as the story goes my father was quite disappointed because he was expecting the babies to look like little cats and not some kind of shrimp mom and dad gave two away and kept the third a black cat with the political incorrect name of sambo
you were destined for this this may well have been your purpose
you are my new favorite person thank you for helping this little girl who looks like she may still be a kitten herself
thank you for helping take care of her and her new bebes lt
momma cats are prioritising where a safe place to have their babies is if this momma cat picked you good job you re probably coming across as a good and kind human d
a feral cat gave birth to eight kittens under the house behind us while it was empty between tenants caught the kittens and the malnourished mother who was skin and bones found homes for six of the eight kittens and adopt the mother and two brothers one of the best things i ever did it‚Äôs been amazing watching the interaction between the two brothers growing up their late evening wrestling matches on my bed never fail to put an ear to ear smile on face no matter what kind of day it‚Äôs been
she is only looking to give her kits a better life than what she had
thank you for helping the mama out that was pretty awesome of you please get her spayed when her babies are weaned but before you put her back out
years ago we knowingly took in a pregnant feral cat we arrived home on labor day yes to her going in to labor she had healthy kittens that went to family and or stayed with us
for a feral she is absolutely gorgeous not that ferals can t be beautiful but this one honestly looks adoption ready
she looks very grateful you did a good thing today please say you ll keep them all now
i lt you more than i can say now you better keep them or face my wrath just kidding i have no wrath
you should really create a dark area for them like a large box or something
are you going to care for the mother and baby s great post though
our cat adopted us and i swear it was planned he showed up early afternoon and played with my wife and daughter and they loved him but i said we don t need a cat and then i m sitting outside and he comes up to me right as it starts raining imagine that i couldn t leave him out in the rain so we locked him in a room for the night we had dogs and didn t know how everybody would get along next day my year old is carrying him around the house singing songs about him and i knew i had a cat
ah reminds me of the kitty from a prior apartment complex i saw my two cats staring at the patio where this cat decided to sit so i left out some food for it next thing i know it s bringing its kittens into my patio one by one eight total x x obviously abandoned as she was very tame and instantly took to a litter box funny enough the kittens instantly could use the box too after clearing their eye infections and getting the mom spayed though i had to give them up to the shelter hope they re ok
if you‚Äôre financially able to please make sure momma is spayed asap and that the babies are fixed before you find homes for them momma could go back out and get pregnant basically any time so important to get her sorted if she will be outdoors
this really struck me in th grade my school went on the annual trip to a camp on cape cod well the day i got back i found this cat hiding under one of our cars the cat stayed around so we name it new kitty well then we found out she was terrified of thunder so she became scared kitty then we found out she was pregnant and she became momma kitty we convinced my parents to keep all the kittens the kicker she looked just like this cat
you‚Äôre a parent massive responsibility mate good luck
it looks like she is saying ‚Äúwtf just happened i didn‚Äôt even know i was pregnant ‚Äù
we took in a stray years ago skinny little black cat maybe a year old with a hard round belly vet we took her to wasn t sure if she was pregnant or not we took her home anyway she and her three babies are currently living the spoiled life
years ago i found a dog on the side of the road i estimated she was about a year old skinny scars on her nose covered in ticks and missing a chunk of her ear i took her home cleaned her up and fed her i was instantly in love anyways a week later she started hiding under my bed constantly and just generally acting odd i took her to the vet and surprise shes was just about ready to give birth i had no idea she was even pregnant every dog i ve ever had has been spayed neutered they told me to take her home and make a comfortable clean place for her that night i became a puppy grandma to boys and girls i got dogs for the price of one
you re a hero also you ve gained a family but lost a rug
this came up to me means this a feral cat is not true
if she came up to you she was probably a stray ferals will avoid humans like the plague but congrats on your new pets they re so cute
what a healthy clean well groomed feral cat congrats
if it was feral she wouldn‚Äôt have come up to u feral cats are afraid of humans
exactly how i ended up having a cat and her kittens otw to dentist saw a cat rolling on cement sidewalk weirdly don‚Äôt care go in for pets cat turned out to be in contraction panic running around looking for a box mins after i‚Äôm a grandma with kitten an hour after i‚Äôm a mom of a grey cat and a grandma to kittens still got them lazy tubby kittens and their mom congratulations op enjoy these little fat kitten babies and their relieved mum she is adorable
watch out for fleas if they get a foothold you can t give medication to the kittens because they re too small give them baths with dish detergent instead they ll hate it but it could literally save their life i had a litter of four kittens back when i was a brand new pet owner and two of them died in utter agony from flea anemia
i felt kinda weird and then these beans fell out of me what happened cat mom
this happened to me just two months ago a cat was hanging out in my driveway and looked hungry and dehydrated so i gave her some food and water couple days later she comes back and continues doing so more and more frequently one day she decided to come inside and lay down and gave birth to little ones so far we aren‚Äôt really sure what to do so the current plan is to keep all cats god help me
gt ive had my car for years and didnt get it fixed but i needed internet points so imma make up some bullshit story and people are going to totally believe it
do not touch the kittens the momma will abandon them obviously handle them if you absolutely must but otherwise don‚Äôt i very recently brought a pregnant stray to my landlords animal hospital and i was told not to touch them i used to work there and have a key because i still take the dogs for walk when i have time
if u need help feeding them please let me know thanks for letting her in and taking care of her
now remember catch neuter release before they have more kittens or better yet just keep them inside where they belong it s well known cats are better off inside someone in our neighborhood just killed all the feral outdoor cats somehow cause they were a bane to the neighborhood and destroying property not sure how they did it but last week within a few days the cats were all dead
now go find the tom that did that to her and tell him what s what
also i think i would like an update on this story in a few days or a week like does it still act feral is it friendly with you still
yes an ultimate blessing my little feral pickles marie is right next to me the runt of the litter she had ear surgery on wednesday thank the gods for people like you
thanks for being kind and showing the cats some love
it‚Äôs weird how feral cats that would otherwise run or attack a human attempting to interact with them seem to seek out humans when in distress i‚Äôve heard of them doing this with kittens and one utter bastard of a stray tom cat showed up on my doorstep when it had a broken leg
poor scared girl wanted a safe place to have her kitties
that s a different cloth had my cat give birth in my bed with me in it there was a huge pink stain on it don t see such a stain here
thank you for helping her when she needed you you have to be a very good person for a cat to trust you and you got a stray to decide you re worthy of such trust congrats on being adopted
cat looks like it s going to kill you in your sleep
that does not look like a feral cat that looks like a well cared for cat
congratulations on your counts five new cats note for roughly the next days the small ones count as a single cat unit by day however they will figure out how to somehow count as full cat units
awww thank you for being a kind human and helping her how precious she‚Äôs thankful for you ‚ô•Ô∏è
op what have you done now everyone is going to tell how you should and shouldn‚Äôt do with these cats
u lalisbk so much to do now are you going to take them to the vet to get them checked out
oh how nice of you to take care of her that is really living up to the trust she put in you thanks
hey i don t know you but i need your help with this for real
ohmygod that‚Äôs amazing i wonder if she has a home it‚Äôs amazing that cats know they can trust people to help them in situations like this
she s looks thankful and like she s trying to murder you with her eyes all at once
well a pregnant feral showed up at my backyard four years ago and now i have like generations living with me had no money to have them spayed still have no money lol no shelters here either take note i live in a third class city in a third world country things suck here
that happened to me once the mom cat then ate all the babies over the next week i was crushed
awwww little tabby cat has such a nice soft expression that is so cool you were chosen üòçüòçüòçüòç
need update late friday night east coasters need an update
that was a rush wow you are now a certified cat birth giver wait that sounded wrong
you may want to have her checked for a chip she does look well cared fore and may just be someones baby
bless you for taking her in and keeping her and her babies safe will she be spayed and her kittens fostered also if she came up to you and let you bring her inside i d say she s a stray and not a feral does she seem sociable i wish the best for you and mama and her babies
i love this about animals one time i was driving the morning after a frigid winter night it was well into the negatives and i saw a black cat running along the road i stopped my car and rolled down the window this caught his attention and he ran towards me i opened the car door and he jumped onto my lap i took him in that night and a friend of mine adopted him and he‚Äôs in his furever home now when cats need help they let you know
well done human that face says i ve always depended upon the kindness of strangers
the same adoption process our cat took with us decided our back porch was the perfect place to have her kittens i went from no cats will ever be allowed inside the house to ok she can come in until we get the kittens rehomed to now she greets me after work every day outside climbs up my leg and side and rides in the house on my shoulder
what a sweetie my girl murph named her that because that s what it sounds like when she meows insisted on having hers on me i tried to get her somewhere comfortable but she was starting to have them just walking around i said screw it put a towel on me and experienced the miracle of childbirth way up close and i gotta tell ya pretty gross
feral cat acting weird let s definitely not assume it s rabies
i‚Äôm not trying to bring the mood down but please keep an extra close eye on those kittens changing the birth location last minute can sometimes cause momma cats to reject their kittens i applaud your kind heart op and i know that i would want someone to tell me as well good luck with the kitties
well done the made me smile so much the trust but also wary look on her face
please spay her and either let her lose again or take her to a shelter where she can be adopted but most likely she s used to the streets at the very least spay her and then have to have the kittens adopted
how the hell did you know the cat was having contractions
this scared me for a second we have the same blanket i thought my wife posted this
good grief there‚Äôs a lot of bad info in this thread and know it all buttholes as far as the eye can see
aww thank you for helping her if possible get her spayed afterward so if she chooses to continue to be feral she doesn‚Äôt have to have babies to be free
and posts below yours what really happens after you give birth new mothers reveal how unprepared they felt for the severity of postpartum physical changes üò∫
i‚Äôm fostering a feral cat and her kittens right now she gave birth on my carpet too ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
yes facilitate the cat population inversely proportional to the other small mammal populations
apparently feral cats in heat or pregnant will become fairly docile when i was in college we had this little black cat show up on the porch while i was out having a smoke super cute all she wanted was to hop in my lap and be held we thought she might be lost and she looked pregnant so we took her to a vet to get scanned for a chip and checked out she wasn‚Äôt pregnant and she didn‚Äôt have an owner but she was in heat so we did the free feral cat neuter program night and day difference once she recovered it took a few weeks but we got her back to being friendly again then found a family that could take care of her
congratulations on being chosen maybe one will be the reincarnation of grumpy cat
this is why women aren t libertarians eventually even a feral cat knows she needs help and those assholes don t ask for nothing from people i feel like this comment isn t going to go well but what the hell
i love how committed people are to not adopting kittens out too young but the rules are different if you re dealing with ferals if you want to tame feral kittens your best bet is to get them before eight weeks if you can keep them with their mother while providing human interaction that is ideal provided the mother is not actively fighting your efforts otherwise they have the best chance of being socialized and adopted if you get them away from their mothers before they are eight weeks old do not take them away from their mother before four weeks while learning to cat is very important it is better to get an already tame cat involved than to leave them with a feral mother until they are older than eight weeks it s certainly possible to tame a kitten after that point but it becomes much harder and in some cases impossible
i am unsure of you but this soft surface you placed me on is acceptable
when i was i still in high school my brothers let puppies be born on my bed there was blood and puppy juice every fucking where dood i was pissed when i got home man i m venting a lot today with my comments
that‚Äôs amazing she asked for help and it looks like she found the right human to ask thanks for giving a temporary home to these adorable babies and their beautiful momma
i find it so cute how she went to the stranger human for help
that look of gratitude is worth everything you‚Äôre a great human
keep them all give them a home feed them too much give them every toy you ever come across
please be careful and steel yourself for heartache feral cats are much more likely to have kittens that succumb to fading kitten syndrome watch for reduced appetite and make sure they have a warm environment a heating pad can really help
thank you for caring for this momma and her babies ‚ù§
at the risk of being incorrect the cat in this picture is immaculate and does not look even slightly feral are you sure it doesn t belong to someone else otherwise was this photo taken like several days after when you fed and brushed her or something i had a similar thing happen and the cat was definitely not as clean calm or pristine as this one and i have never seen a feral cat look this good
clearly not feral if she approached you but good on ya
i have of these blankets congrats on the baby very cute edit babies
going through your comments and seeing you call her ‚Äúmommy cat‚Äù if you ask me that‚Äôs a cute name for her lol
this happened to a friend of mine a few years back i have one of the kittens from the litter my best buddy now his name is cowboy ‚ù§‚ù§
awwwwww she‚Äôs adorable do you think you‚Äôll keep her and her kittens for awhile i absolutely love it when animals ask us for help a few years ago an adorable sick little kitty was crying and following me outside of my job and i nursed her back to health before getting her to a cat adoption center i wish i could have kept her i think about her everyday at least once a day and pray she has an awesome life i had dogs at the time and the little guys might have killed her i really miss that lil sweetie
my former cat laid on my belly as i was asleep she broke her water on me
i m a dog person but this is very sweet and the animal world appreciates your kindness
i m glad you got momma and her babies to a safe spot looks comfy
nice on your part but if it really is a feral cat it will not want no humans touching it s babies if so most feral cats will abandon their kittens
looks like you now have a momma cat and a set of kittens
poor little cat was scared amp need help you are a good person for helping that scared little animal
you did the right thing but i don‚Äôt think you know what feral means
we have that same blanket and my cat loves it we call it his ‚Äúbiscuit blankie‚Äù
i had something similar happen in college i was waiting for a cab in a sketchy part of boston and this cat wouldn t leave me alone so i was like screw it i took her back to my dorm days later i have kittens in the dorm i ended up giving the mom and kittens to a shelter but i felt soooo sad after that so a few months later when the kittens were old enough i adopted the mom back and have her to my grandparents
that s how i ended up with five cats and years later i m very happy to have had them all
even if you re not gonna keep them it would be really sweet if you took all of them and got them spayed or neutered as soon as they can this is a very serious problem right not that is actively hurting all urban animals still super nice of you to take care of this unexpected momma
probably not the true feral cat of it sought you out while pregnant
reminds me of my cat who gave birth on me while i was asleep luckily my brother noticed and saved the day wherever you are rn ms teez i miss you
i had something similar happen in college i was waiting for a cab in a sketchy part of boston and this cat wouldn t leave me alone so i was like screw it i took her back to my dorm days later i have kittens in the dorm i ended up giving the mom and kittens to a shelter but i felt sooooo sad after that i remember walking in boston on the verge of tears so a few months later when the kittens were old enough i adopted the mom back and have her to my grandparents she still lives with them i shared an imgur album of the whole trip on reddit via my old account it didn t get much attention though
awww what a good momma now take her to get spayed and raise those kittens well üíï
i care you care we care you made a loyal friend for life
what a great story see how smart they are she saw u and knew were a great human being with a loving heart for cats i know u will give them to good families maybe families that don‚Äôt have lots of little kids sometimes kids don‚Äôt know cats don‚Äôt like their tails pulled i‚Äôm sure u know what i mean i have cats now adopted and my little guy i brought in from the cold thank you so much for not ignoring her she‚Äôs gonna love you ‚òòÔ∏è
she‚Äôs so beautiful and the beebies are just precious
in her mind she just got kidnapped and now her children and herself are hostages
please tell me you are near saint louis i would love to help
i had something similar happen in college i was waiting for a cab in a sketchy part of boston and this cat wouldn t leave me alone it was hella cold out so i was like screw it and took her back to my dorm in the cab three days later the cat starts meowing like crazy and goes into my bathroom i follow her in and she keeps meowing so i tell her sometimes it hurts to poop and i left to give her privacy when i came back there was two cats in the bathroom the mom picked up the new kitten and went back into my room into my closet and had two more kittens i remember calling angell mspca worried that a fourth kitten was stuck because i don t think odd numbered litters are common i ended up giving the mom and kittens to a shelter but i felt sooooo sad after that after leaving the shelter i remember walking in boston on the verge of tears so a few months later when the kittens were old enough i adopted the mom back and have her to my grandparents she still lives with them i shared an imgur album of the whole trip on reddit via my old account it didn t get much attention though
this will get buried but i went through some of your comment history and saw she is stressed cats especially new moms need confinement and small spaces to feel safe can you possibly give her a box or pen that has some amount of cover so she feels hidden i ve seen mom cats and babies put in the bathtub on blankets with cardboard laid over the tub that way it feels safe but there s still space for mom to get out whatever you do thank you for your promise to have her spayed it s so important and a lot of people don t understand why
how did you recognize the contractions instinct intuition
can you touch the cat or the babies or will she attack you
that cat is the best looking feral cat i ve ever seen
yikes to all the weirdo comments correcting you telling you what to do because you‚Äôve done everything right good for you you amazing human love on those babies and momma for me will ya
i had a cat give birth in my bed in the middle of the night scratched my leg like crazy
my mom had the same situation the cat turned out to be a terrible mom and all the kittens died but the car stuck around and more showed up to join her
awwww this is how i ended up with my cat minnie see post history she only had kittens though it was amazing and i may be getting weepy thinking about it
i brought a feral cat into my home when i found it outside and the temperature was c it was frozen solid but it went kind of crazy after it warmed up my local animal control warned me that feral cats can carry a number of diseases that would be hazardous to my domestic cats just a fyi better take the new mom to the vet
raising newborn kittens is so much work it s another job not exaggerating it s a constant thing for three months you have to plan around them haha if you have a family who is old enough to be responsible and help they can and it makes it a little easier but do not underestimate the work to be done
you sure that cat doesnt have rabis the reddit disease of the apocalypse no seriously though
so cute three years ago my aunt had a cat pick her too just walked into the garage and meowed at my aunt and then she took her in and soon there were kittens they ended up keeping mama and the smallest kitten gave away and i got one our cat is the suckiest most cuddly but sassy cat in the world
you‚Äôre the good kind of human out there thank you for letting this kitty deliver comfortably
you had better love and take care of that prescious little lady
wow please be sure to spay her amp also have the babies fixed before adopting them out there should be a local humane society that will have low cost spay amp neuter clinics congratulations
op you make the world a better place thank you for being the way you are üíó
interesting way to become the neighborhood crazy cat person
that mommy has that gratitude face saying thank you for helping my little mew pews
thank you for the pic and for taking care of this cat very cute very sweet
beautiful color on her i have a cat that looks just like her
i bet all those things happened exactly the way you typed them
thats amazing all those things happened exactly the way you typed them
i ve witnessed a cat giving birth it s an odd thing to watch
you re killing more animals if you let it loose than keeping it boxed up in you re home there is no ethical victory to letting a cat go they kill for fun
wow you are pretty stupid now you have a cat destroying your house and have to pay all this money
very nice thank you for taking in this cat keep this in mind if this cat had gone up to someone with bad intentions this safe birth wouldn t have taken place you are responsible for saving five little lives today thank you for sharing very sweet
i ve never seen a more sorry i m a freeloader face in my life
my cat looks just like yours and share nearly the same story aside from having kittens it‚Äôs like looking at a photo of her congrats on the cat kittens and good luck with taking care of them lt feral cats are absolute sweethearts especially after gaining their trust
don t let the cat back out cats are one of the biggest detrimental invasive species they kill for the fun of it and dozens of times a day i have cats don t let them outside
she doesn t look feral did you mean a stray cat will you foster her amp the kids for adoption she has a trusting expression on her face as if she s humanized socialized to humans
cats the only domesticated species that decided to move in with us
i would try getting some feliway plug ins for the room she s in to help calm her down
her face is so precious congratulations on the surprise
hey i had a similar experience with my estranged cat who just suddenly decided to get all cuddly with me one afternoon turns out she s having contractions too and it was her first time being a mother so i think she s really having a bad time that was also the first time i saw a cat s paw go all sweaty
you have been chosen by not just one god but five gods bow down before your furry overlords
well reddit loves you now thanks for being a caring person to the furbabies
this infamously happens with huge corporations like nike as well in fact i think your employing more people with buying reps since people need to make republications of the original product which is no longer being produced i think a big problem lies when the factor of limited stock comes into play i think that if a product is readily available at a fair designer price for what its worth in labor materials and design then you should purchase it otherwise i think it s fairly justified that you are stealing from the companies profits but having a limited stock just to emit exclusivity is a whole different can of worms since you aren t directly supporting the company anymore it s a whole different market
aww this is how i got the fluff sitting next to me currently patches was born in a litter at a friends house to a feral momma and she‚Äôs been with me for years now ‚ò∫Ô∏è
aww this is how i got the fluff sitting next to me currently patches was born in a litter at a friends house to a feral momma and she‚Äôs been with me for years now
all of these comments detailing similar stories i fucking can t this is too cute i c a n t
if you can keep the kittens weeks you will improve their healthy immune systems and prevent stress response behaviors my cat was rescued at weeks and he is a nervous cat that frequently sucks on blankets i let him suck on the blankets but it bothers some people because the blankets get wet he does this because he was away from his mama too early please wait weeks before people adopt them
yes aww but also that cat is gonna pee all over your house
so you brought in a feral cat it dropped a kid on your white carpet and you say worth it heart of gold right there you are good people
before you decide to keep her please please please check to see if she has been microchipped this could be someones little angel who got out
could we get updates on this i would like to see what all goes down do they return to the wild do they find a new home do you keep all the cats so many unanswered questions
we my family i had no say as a child brought in a feral when i was young i know they can be quite feral at times but damn if they arent the most sincere heartfelt cats ever i cant imagine the level of protection and pride she has for her litter
this is beautiful but that cat is a stray not a feral please see if she s been chipped i m of the opinion that if you re letting your heavily pregnant cat roam around outside then you re not giving your cat the best care she deserves and she probably deserves better but sometimes things happen that aren t the owner s fault
as others have said even if you aren‚Äôt keeping the cats please make sure the kittens stay with their mum for at least weeks and if possible see if they the kittens can all be adopted together
i work in animal welfare and i appreciate your efforts this is not an easy timw of year thank you
i work in animal welfare and i appreciate your efforts this is not an easy time of year
i can just see her happy little feet making biscuits in this pic she‚Äôs so sweet
thanks for being awesome let me know if you send them to a shelter and i ll send a donation if you need anything let me know
what a sweet heart i‚Äôm sure she scratched you every time you tried to help
please just indoor they kill shit and they get killed just keep them inside
sounds like she made a good decision coming to you if your willing to foster an agency will help you find the kittens good home and spay the mom for free i would try your local pet store and see if they can put you in contact with good adoption agencies that show their kittens in their store
awwww you‚Äôre so lucky i love having kittens i dont care how much care they need
what is it with feral cats and finding humans to have babies around cats that would normally not come near a human will insist on having their babies around one my grandparents had cats that lived in the woods outside their house and twice the wild pregnant mama asked to come inside and had her kittens on the couch twice
this is how you get a cat you dont go to the store one will choose you and you must accept it
you are the hero we deserve happy kitten day to you and yours mate
one of those kitties looks just like a melynx from the monster hunter games expect that one to steal the chicken off your dinner plate
great she trusted you to help please have the mom fixed in wks or so especially before you release here if that is your intent plenty of orgs there to help with ferals you can find them online
thank you for giving her somewhere safe to have her kittens you are an amazing human being and yes do give the kittens enough time so they re ready though to be honest i am pretty sure i got my cat oswin when he was around like weeks old i didn t know any better and the people giving away the kittens said they were ready he was tiny and adorable and also mistake for a female but he s the most amazing cat i ve ever met
now you have four cats what a great return on investment cute little fat babies too
you are a good human and now you have at least one cat
momma cat is a kitten herself and looks to be about months old years ago we adopted a tabby just like yours who had just given birth to a litter i named her cassidy and we enjoyed her for over years so you may have just met a lifelong friend there enjoy the ride
aw little jellybeans i like cats with this striped pattern it reminds me of my old cat
does absolutely everyone get that blanket for their pets
what a great return on investment very cute little fat babies too
awww that‚Äôs cute that she went out of her way to find someone to help her
awwwwwww wow she‚Äôs so lucky thanks for giving her a safe space hoping she gets fixed somehow
can t believe how much of these posts are spammed in gag lool
i had the same thing happen all but one kitten was born dead and the mom was really tiny but both have gone on to live happy lives in their adopted homes my cat was pissed though
the look on her face screams that was fucking rough
a feral cat had kittens under our neighbor s shed about weeks later momma cat was killed by a car our neighbor s wife hated pets in general and cats in particular and they literally herded the kitten ls into our yard so with loving attention of a female lab and a female cat plus an adolescent daughter and her friends we hand fed the kittens at about weeks after being cleared by the vet we adopted of them out to good homes and kept the two black kittens one of them is sitting on my lap right now

same with my baby boy we rescued him when he was about months old but he seemed to have been away from his mom for longer he‚Äôs a little awkward and refuses to be held or picked up we rescued him from our neighbor who locked him out during the summer with no food or water my mom found him passed out in the public parking lot guy didn‚Äôt want him back
there s a litter box in my bathroom today my cat came in while i was pooping and she pooped with me at the same time similarly i was surprised and knew she was having contractions too but i didn t keep what came out of her
holy shit all i want is to find one free cat to take home but you got a whole litter
you obviously don t know the difference between a stray cat and a feral cat
peroxide will get the stain out for blood and white material it s the best congrats to the kitty mama and the human mama
super sweet story hopefully they all get fixed when they re old enough that s not a feral cat btw feral cats rarely approach humans unless habituallybeing fed and definitely wouldn t come to a human to have a litter
aww good on you i live in a throw away unwanted pets area thus i have sweet you took her and the litter in
peroxide will get the stain out it is great for blood on white material congrats to the kitty momma and the hooman parents
aren t they weird a feral cat climbed our screen door meowing it s head off i let her in and out came the first of two babies on my bare foot we kept the babies
let them inbreed each subsequent litter looks more and more interling
that‚Äôs awesome that the cat chose you cats particularly pregnant one must have good instincts as to would be safe
sweet you‚Äôre a good person she‚Äôs lucky she found you üòÄ
that cat doesnt look very feral it could be a neighbors
make sure to feed mum kitten food whilst she‚Äôs lactating and feeding the kittens
that cat doesnt look very feral it could be a neighbors
the first day my cat went into heat i thought she had developed a grass allergy and was rubbing herself all over me to try to scratch itchy skin for some reason i thought this despite the fact that she is an indoor cat it took me over hours to figure it out i have no idea how you could possibly figure out a strange cat was having contractions
why did the pregnant cat come find you i d think a pregnant cat would want to be hidden do they do seek human help instinctually
i have owned many cats and many of those cats were feral it may take some time but if that is a true feral cat she will probably end up being the most lovable and appreciative cat you ll ever meet at least that s how it usually went for my cats actually had a somewhat similar situation as you and as sad as it is to say she isn t with us anymore between me my brother and my mom have all of her offspring still they are now years old and very happy they never lived a day on the street thanks to their mom and she was so appreciative of a safe place for her and her kittens that we could actually feel it coming off of her
congrats on your new feral cat i have one as well and she is my favorite little asshole
you are a wonderful person enjoy the antics today as they will be memories you will share forever been there loved that ps tell that mama i think she is gorgeous
you re a great person thank you for keeping my faith on humanity
you re a good person thanks for keeping my faith on the humanity
‚Äúuuummmm so this is awkward i thought i was fine and didn‚Äôt know you so like can we stay here and please don‚Äôt eat my babies ok thank you ‚Äù cat probably
i really hope that my upvote and comment will yield an it s ok sweetheart you are good
bless you may your good karma come back to you multiplied and may you find homes for them all
i really hope that my upvote and comment will yield an it s ok sweetheart you are good i know you didn t need to hear that
please make sure she didn t have some of the kittens already outside and that s why she wants out
damn what an adventure i know from experience cats just give birth anywhere lol but good on you for helping a poor cat
please please please vaccinate mama asap at a farm and feed store for an fvrcp dose it s too early for the babies but she ll pass antibodies through her milk
me bitter old shriveled demon heart has been warmed beyond my wildest dreams ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüß°üß°üíõüíõüíöüíö
awww now she must be relaxed no stress for this mummy so she can nourish her babies
how awesome that you brought her in and cared for her while she had her kittens i can t imagine having any of my kids out on the streets
what city are you in these kittens are adorable and i‚Äôd be willing to shelter one if it wasn‚Äôt a massive drive or anything if not i‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll find their purrfect forever home i‚Äôve got girls of my own right now that are the most lovable cats ever
both of our cats adopted my mother by climbing her as kittens and she took them home she foisted them onto us at about months of age amp x b neither have learned to stop marking their territory inside our house and the older one doesn t know how to bury his poop they drive me nuts with the piss smell everywhere
its no joke when cats give birth you dont know how many will be in there
that cat s tail wouldn t happen to be crooked would it
sometimes animals choose us instead of us choosing them this cat clearly chose you
kitten season is in full swing i wish a preggers kitty would come into my life i would love that so much you are very lucky i live in lake forest california there are no cats around here outside mostly because of the coyotes amp people knowing better and people will take any cat they find to the shelter around here it s a no kill shelter which is cool in a way but also not if you want to have your kitty be outdoors and indoors it s just a very weird sanitized city they don t allow homeless people and they don t allow stray animals at any rate congrats
congratulations on your new cat and kittens i dont if you know how cats work but you re stuck with them now lol
our current pair adopted our mother when she was doing door to door surveys by climbing her and not letting go as feral kittens months apart amp x b she foisted them on us at a year of age amp x b neither has stopped marking the house since and the male doesn t know how to bury his poop in the litter box they re both adorable and cuddly but i m tired of every corner of my house being pissed in
god this reminded me of the kitten i saw on the road yesterday night i thought it was being playful while laying down got closer and jesus christ half of it‚Äôs head was crushed and was struggling i was petrified i was about to buy some food but just continued walking traumatized i can‚Äôt even turn and cross the street

our current two adopted our mother when she was doing door to door surveys by climbing her shoulder and refusing to get down feral strays six months apart same mechanism she foisted them on us when they were a year old they re both cuddly monsters but the older one can t figure out how to bury his poop in the litter box he claws up the lining on the end instead and both of them mark everywhere amp x b i love them but i m tired of every part of my house smelling like cat piss
imagine a world where predators are round every corner and being a species that other animals turn to when things look bleak i m in pain starving and can t cope what i really need right now is a human to help me

i m sure others have said this and you probably already know but i ll say it anyway if you re giving the kittens away please charge for them it deters people that either want to abuse and torture an animal or want to use kittens as bait for things like dog fighting it s sad to hear but it happens so a price tag can really help deter those people even if it s like on a more uplifting note good on you for taking mama cat in and accommodating her when she needed it most hopefully she settles in well at your home ‚ò∫Ô∏è
i had a similar situation to this in the end mom only wanted to stay inside until the kittens were no longer nursing she‚Äôs now strictly outdoor i gave of the kittens to friends and their doing well i kept the th the runt and she turned out to be the biggest and acts more like a dog than a cat she follows me everywhere and she talks to me a lot i‚Äôve had cats all my life and never had one so talkative
you mentioned in a comment that you plan on having the mom fixed which is awesome but make sure not to do that while the kittens are nursing and talk to your vet keeping them all together while she is nursing will save a lot of work because kittens are hard to care for between feedings and helping them defecate but she will probably do most of it if they‚Äôre together you‚Äôre clearly an amazing person for helping her out i took in a stray mom and she destroyed the doorway trying to get out of the room she was in to potentially save your carpets a little i would suggest letting her roam the house at night so she can get a feel for her space if possible
my old withered heart has been warmed by this beautiful story
"look up the kitten lady and orphan kitten club
she has a lot of useful information on teeny kitties and feral mommies"
our current cats adopted my mother when she was doing door to door surveys census by climbing her shoulder and refusing to leave her when they were kittens months apart same behavior she foisted them on us when they were a year old they re both super cuddly but the older male still can t figure out how to bury his poop in the litter box he claws the liner instead and both of them mark everywhere regularly i love them both but i m tired of our house smelling like cat piss
i think the kitten my son got for mom its his has some of the same issues mentioned below she was and is undersized looks like a kitten at years old eats strictly wet food every morning and has this odd and haunting meerowwww sort of vocalizations but she s sweet does headbutts and lays near me when i nap good cat would not chuck her outside last weird thing hates outdoors freaks her out
i love how we treat a feral animal like this when they re responsible for wiping out entire bird species
many people assume that humans adopt cats this is false cats adopt humans congrats on your new family members op
ferral cat hymen on my white rug fucking lol indeed
congrats grandpa this happened to me back in the s a pregnant stay cat adopted me and moved into my house two days before having her litter first one was stuck so i had to reach in and help it out rest came out easy what a trip
horror story flash backs from this my dad and his girlfriend brought in a stray they had her for a few months and she ended up having kittens after a few weeks she started getting really protective of them my dad was sitting on the couch when all of a sudden this cat lunged for his throat and started tearing at his arms and chest trying to get to him he threw her off but she kept coming back there was blood everywhere eventually he was able to get her outside where she was literally banging her head off the glass sliding door trying to get in two people walked by on the sidewalk and she lunged for them as well animal control had to come and take her away they kept the two kittens which are really great cats now so yeah just be careful
it‚Äôs amazing how humans are like gods that animals wander up to when they have some problem and we just solve it
awwww you are a great person for taking momma kitty in
is it normal for feral cats to do that i figured they d avoid humans and find a spot in the woods do the feral father cats help out the mom in finding the birthing spot and bringing food
welp that s not a feral cat i can assure you that lol
just make sure she‚Äôs actually feral we got our cat because she did exactly this turns out she was from a few doors down the road we only found out when after all our puss‚Äô kittens died she was only around months old when she had them the neighbour cane round and said the cat had snuck back into her old house and stolen one of her sisters kittens cat then adopted us permanently and refused to go back to its original home she subsequently had another litter of kittens in someone‚Äôs shed and and until we found them we would only see her at meal times someone might be looking for her
not sure if anyone has said this but contact your local vet looking after a mama and her kittens for weeks can be a lot of work and you ll need to know vaccine schedules and diet once they ve started weaning off enjoy i fostered week old puppies briefly animals are ridiculously cute at that age
ah they love to act like they don t need our help until they have an emergency then they re all about human contact
the mother‚Äôs face is so expressive i hope you keep her
i have sort of an apposite story my car was super well mannered and sweet she was an indie outdoor cat she would ask me to let her out once a day and then she would knock on my window to let her in after she was done doing her thing one day i came to find out she was neutered well a few months later she gives birth to kittens i didn‚Äôt plan to have more cats but i just accepted my fate of having cats intraday if it so happened that those little cats decided to grow into a bunch of feral monsters they didn‚Äôt want anything to do with me even when their mom would come to me for her daily pets they would just hide until traje came back to them they never let me even get close to them i was never able i pet them like why you were born in my house and you grew up around me how the hell did you become so feral when your mom loves me
i had this happen when i was and she brought kittens twice
good on you for taking her in please make sure she gets spayed and the kittens are spayed and neutered it‚Äôs tragic how many cats out there are put down because people won‚Äôt take care of them
this exact thing happened to me with a cat that look just like this it was very friendly i had it on my lap petting it and felt something wet on my leg it was a kitten
such round little fat babies congratulations on the new family
do cats know somehow that humans will keep them safe
i‚Äôve had a few different cats jump up into my lap when they were getting ready to have kittens i‚Äôve always been told that means the cat is comfortable with you i‚Äôve always felt honored and grossed out at the same time like ‚Äúthank you for choosing me but why don‚Äôt i just put you in the big box with a towel laid down and just monitor you having your babehs ‚Äù
is it mating season i ve been seeing cats all over town with newborns wat more than ever before
those blankets are a steal at a piece i just wish there were better colors i have the one you have i think it‚Äôs the best one i‚Äôve never used it for soggy kittens usually just my legs
i had a couple feral tabby momma cats growing up they always preferred being outdoors except when having babies then they‚Äôd run inside and start searching for a nest but they were strangely loyal if not overly affectionate we never wanted for mouse guts or bird heads after that our doorstep was always laden w gifts in the am and in the afternoons their way of saying thanks i suppose
i still have a year old cat that was born this way love you for keeping them safe
something similar has happened to us about and a half years ago an old filthy guy at the end of the street passed away and he had a lot of cats they placed cat traps in the garden to catch all his cats to take them to the animal shelter but one of his youngest kitties was never caught so shes roaming our neighbourhood as a stray and since we had a cat that was outside a lot and had food for him outside she came by to eat his food after a while we noticed that her belly was becoming very big and eventually figured out that she was pregnant at this point we couldnt pet here she was just too shy and scared eventually she came to our backyard without a big belly so we knew she had her babies now we needed to find out where because otherwise they would grow up wild we live near a factory and followed her there we searched the area where she went and found kittens one of which went go a good friend of mine so ive seen him grow up all the way last year she had more kittens but we couldnt find them this time for a while turned out she put them under a shipping container eventually we found but she left them even though she knew they were in our garden house just like the year before so we had to teach them a lot ourselves later on we found out that she had a rd kitten at this point the other were old enough to go to a new home and werent with us anymore and now days ago she had her rd birth of another kittens this time on a blanket in our garden house before she gave birth to these last kittens she let us pet her sometimes but shes still a bit scared but of course now shes protecting her young shes more protective again currently we are working on catching her to have her go to an animal shelter with her kittens and habe her sterilized since we will be moving in less then months and cant care for them anymore before they can leave the nest and we cant care for the mother anymore its been an amazing journey though even though the second time we had to clean out poop from everywhere each morning xd
ahhh i‚Äôm conflicted on this one i get you‚Äôre doing a good deed and what not but you stated you‚Äôre going to keep the mom and get rid of the kittens i can‚Äôt help but think they might‚Äôve been better off without you or maybe just being left food occasionally by you breaking up cat families isn‚Äôt cool
please take more pictures of mummy and baby kittens they‚Äôre so cute
everyday i wish for a story like this to happen to me
mine just had her first litter and she had i was thinking she would maybe have tops but no now we got boys and a girl
oh mama she has those i m thankful thank you for taking me in you re kinda cool but i ll fuck you up if you try to touch my babies eyes
this cat reminds me so much of my year old cat that passed away from cancer a few months ago mine just had a slightly darker fur wish i could get one of the kittens
if i ve said it once i ve said it a million times you don t choose your cats your cats choose you congrats on the grandkitties
there are too many cats in this world should have left them outside to die
this post is really helping me understand cats amp their predicament can t stop scrolling
if you haven t already find a dark quiet out of the way space and put the kittens there don t leave the cat s box out in the open or where there s a lot of human traffic as it will stress the cat out to the point that it may abandon the kittens also i doubt it s a feral cat more like abandoned or it has owners but cat being a cat it went to the nearest humans it could find check with neighbours if anyone is missing a cat
and now the not potty trained cat will shit in the corners you can t reach
i wonder how many of these cats people are talking about in the comments weren t stays
hey can you get her checked for an identity chip feral cats sometimes ask for help but more usually it s cats who have lived with people so there may be a sad cat parent out there
most feral cats get their ear clipped to identify them as feral you might have someone‚Äôs cat i would probably post on social media or keep an eye out for lost cat posters just in case
that cats gonna bolt out the door next chance she gets my mom brought in a feral that had kittens and immediately left never returned
i see you re going to get mama spayed after she s done nursing which is awesome make sure you take her to a good vet who will see everything that needs to be done chipped vaccinated etc for the babies it s kitten season right now look up tnr resources or a humane society in your area giving away the kittens for free opens them up to not being treated well as so many people want a cute kitten but don t want to care for them once they re an adult cat they also need to be neutered vaccinated and chipped once they re old enough but it s a lot to put that on yourself and so many organizations are willing to help
sounds like a weird plot to an anime where the cat turns into a girl
"friendly reminder that letting your cats outside is tremendously ecologically destructive domestic cats kill millions of birds and billions of rodents a year this is not an exaggeration and this collapse is already causing problems and only going to get worse as a bonus indoor cats live longer and are much healthier on average if your argument is that it s natural for cats to be outside and hunt small animals a these animals are not natural predators in these ecosystems unless you live in northern africa
b it s not natural for a predator to kill for sport while being provided with food shelter and veterinary attention"
kitten at the in laws adopted us poor thing had both eyes sealed closed with infection and i feel pretty confident he has no memory of his feline mama because he seems to have imprinted on us and his behavior is very dog like everyone remarks on how strong his eye contact is especially when we say his name he also doesn t know a stranger everyone is frien
to make this worth it and be responsible make sure they are all fixed
great on you for helping but that cat isn t feral so most likely has or had an owner source help catch cats for local animal rescue have caught many feral mums pregnant or with kittens and they d sooner scratch your face off than let you near their kittens you can t simply bring it in without a trap leather gauntlets or both lol
that doesn t look like a feral cat might have an owner
lpt if you find a stray pregnant cat it‚Äôs best to put a bullet in its skull the babies inside will die of malnourishment a few hours later
congratulations on being adopted by a cat and her litter
i m no expert but i believe that s more than one kitten
how did you know she is a stray just curious a lot of people presume cats without collars are strays which of course isn t true
y‚Äôall need to stop posting sweet cat stories or i‚Äôll never be able to get some sleep tonight
oh damn be sure to tell her she‚Äôs a good momma and don‚Äôt let her out of your sight she does not go outside for weeks now
awww if you are in the seattle area lmk id love a kitten
his eyessss hes so precious and he deserves the world
hey everyone i do know the difference between a feral and stray cat lol mommy kitty was born under our shed last summer and nobody has been able to catch her she does not have a home i am not stealing her lol
lmao dumbasses if this were a real stray cat then she would be wayy more protective of her litter and probably shielding them instead of just laying their and looking at the camera
a neighbour came up with stray kittens that arrived into his house he was unable to keep them there before rejoining them as he has several big dogs that dislike cats i said no problem i d find homes for them my dog is super friendly to all animals and made the kittens feel welcome after feeding and giving them milk one kitten disappeared i decided i d just keep the remaining kitten as he was so friendly the following day neighbour called to see how the kittens were getting on and i explained how one disappeared while the other slept with my dog while taking to him the missing kitten returned with of his siblings obviously went looking for th to bring them to their new home got good homes for all the kittens but kept the big ginger tom whois the most affectionate cat i ve ever seen
why do some pregnant cats do this randomly approaching someone and trust them
a feral animal came up to me today took me second to realize it was in labor and immediately forced it into my house my floors are stained with cat birth yes
that cat will never forget you and she will always be grateful
amazing a feral cat would do that feral cats in my neighborhood steer clear of people i ve tried everything to get close
sweet of you to help her i live in michigan and we have local programs to trap and release ferals for spay neuter to control the population if you still have her i would consider looking into this
is that safe just taking her in could she be carrying diseases
i‚Äôm so glad you‚Äôre helpin this mama out poor bbbbbb
how did this happen the cat must have been someone s kitten because it looked for shelter from a human aren t strays supposed to be afraid of us like most animals
you‚Äôre the greatest to stay with a stray that was acting odd you gave her a safe place to give birth and are making sure she and her babies stay safe and end up with homes we need more people out there like you
that is a wtf where do we go from here face if ever i saw one
those kittens look like they‚Äôre ready to be stacked like a game of jenga
the cat went like open the door human and when the door opened this is my house now
that s a loving look she s giving you she s thankful good job take care of them
i often wish this would happen to me i love all kitties unfortunately my yo girl does not love all kitties
litterally of my cats came to my house years ago and they re living with me since
has flashbacks to first cat giving birth on me while asleep oh yikes
this is an invasive species vermin pest creatures that are doing untold damage and extinction level destruction to countless ecosystems and bird life small mammal populations cats are ecological disasters dont be fooled by the cuteness etc so please if you really care about nature please kill the mother and kittens they have to be permantely removed from the ecosystem
people have tried to teach op what feral means and she has replied is feral lives under shed times at the time of this post
don t mess with feral animals acting strangely you could catch rabies and die
when i was a kid i was about to go to bed but my parents stopped me turns out a cat entered in our house through the window just to give birth on my crib it was winter so she hadn t many options yikes but i m happy for her
if you need someone to adopt a kitten i m out of ohio so i m kinda close
for some reason i read this as a federal cat quite confusing at first
last summer a feral kitten appeared on our patio licking the barbecue tools we could used to cook salmon she was all skin and bones my son put out food and water for her even though she was totally wild after a few months she became a loving sweet pet i like to lay on my couch and hold my ipad and she likes to sit on my chest to look at it she loves candy crush last month i noticed that when she sat on me my left boob was sore long story short i have just had a cancerous tumor removed i will be having radiation therapy next month and i should be fine after that our little feral probably saved my life
aw she trusted you i had a stray tom come to our doorstep and we ended up keeping him after loved that cat
i remember when i delivered my kittys babies onto my spice girls bed covers when i was and alone it freaked me tf out but kitty did all the work and was badass my mum didn t believe me that i thought she was pregnant it was a sight for sure hope mum and babies are doing good
she‚Äôs just a little kitten herself thanks for being so kind did you contact your local spca or humane society to ask for assistance with spay and of course the kittens in the near future
please help spay and neuter those kittens and mama cat
congrats also take good care of the little fur babies please hooman
i‚Äôm not trying to be that guy but you are pretty lucky it wasn‚Äôt acting weird cuz rabies
congrats you have been just successfully adopted by a cat
"oh
my god a feral cat came into my house and she was huge and she purred and we fed her and everything but she looks identical to this one he cc"
that poor baby thank you for rescuing her from life on the street
in two stray cats kept hanging around our garage one was a black and white cat and the other was a grey tabby i knew the b amp w cat because it showed up with a litter mate same color and markings a few months before the b amp w cat was extremely skittish but her litter mate was quite friendly and i grew fond of it litter mate disappeared one day and b amp w subsequently found a new friend grey tabby gt to hang out with gt had so much personality and was undeterred by my resolve to be disinterested i tried not to like gt but she was plucky b amp w always hovered in the distance like a shadow until one day both gt and b amp w showed up obviously pregnant together in my garage i kept thinking what are the chances gt gave birth to a litter of kittens in our garage on the evening of good friday one kitten died i kept trying to scoot it next to her even though she rejected it then tried to massage it back to life nothing worked i felt like a failure and cried the funny thing is that our twin boys were five years old at the time so we had to keep the birth a secret so they wouldn t disturb gt and her kittens my husband and i kept sneaking out to the garage for a peek at the birthing i heard meowing in the alley that same weekend and realized that b amp w had also given birth i couldn t tell where her nest was but i knew her litter was nearby because she showed up looking lean and hungry after a week gt decided to move her kittens to an undisclosed residence mind you this was after we all grew very attached to them and were calling them ours i was heartbroken the following weekend a neighbor knocked on our door and said there was a grey tabby dead in the middle of the street and it looked like the one that we had been feeding it was i was frantic where were those kittens after an exhaustive search i threw in the towel it was over the kittens were dead i was depressed so were the twins i could not stop thinking about how the kittens might have died and then i would get mad at gt all over again for moving them the next weekend a neighbor came to my garage holding three kittens and said are these the kittens you were looking for they were apparently b amp w cat had taken over feeding both her litter and gt s and was positively wraith like from the effort we bottle fed gt s three kittens because b amp w stopped showing an interest in them after the neighbor brought them to our house although she still showed up regularly for food i felt like we owed her for saving gt s kittens so we lavished her with praise and food and got her spayed b amp w had three kittens of her own and they would occasionally pop out of their nest to hiss at us i can t think of anything that compares to the incongruity of being hissed at by an oz adorable ball of fluff we found homes for all of the kittens except the one we kept from gt s litter mr black who was named thus because the twins were reading one fish two fish at the time brown came back with mr black as a bottle fed kitten he is laid back and loyal to his humans more like a dog he is always by my side b amp w cat whom we call momcat is so comfy with us that she is a permanent indoor resident these cats have been family members for years and have been a part of our twin sons‚Äô lives for as long as they can remember we didn‚Äôt plan to acquire our animal companions this way it just happened but we could not have planned it more perfectly
did she scratch you when you tried carrying her or was she just squirmy
please get momma and babies fixed if you can‚Äôt commit to getting all the babies fixed talk to a shelter they may let you ‚Äúfoster‚Äù mom and babies then everyone gets their necessary medical care and you aren‚Äôt stuck with a huge vet bill please please do not adopt out the kittens without getting them fixed even if someone tells you that they‚Äôre going to get it fixed later there is a very high risk it won‚Äôt happen or it won‚Äôt happen soon enough so many cats are euthanized every year please spay and neuter
this happened to my mom years ago with a feral don t think she was actually feral because she was cool with us but she came to us heavily pregnant stratching at the front door and when my mom opened it she strolled right in like it was her house we were like okay get this after we got her fixed and took her to the shelter and moved house she showed up in a tree outside the new house which she d never been to before many miles from the old house we were dumbfounded but knew we had to keep her we later found out she had fiv which was sad but she continued to live a long life while separated from our other cats cats really do choose people
she doesn t look feral she has a trusting expression may be recently lost stray will you foster her amp her neonates towards adoption
my husband and i live in a neighborhood with a ton of stay cats there s been two times where a litter of kittens were dropped off in our shed we were able to catch a few of the adult cats and get them spayed and neutered but there s still a lot out there making babies we don t mind taking care of the kittens and finding them good homes though we already have four cats of our own so we can t keep any of the kittens p
ah that s cute you had too i rescued a feral cat like months ago and she just had a litter of a like days ago now
i ve heard similiar wonderful stories before about how a cat or dog knows just the right person to to go to for help or even a home i m so glad you were observant and able to help her
its kinda crazy how cats can just come up to people and get let inside their house to give birth to babies while if a human did that they would be shooed away
how the hell did you figure out it was having contractions
aww she came up to you asking you for help she couldn‚Äôt find a suitable place to give birth was in pain from the contractions and out of time you came to her rescue
oh my god i would totes do that cause that it s totes worth it
i ll upvote you after you let us know you had her spayed
i got one of my cats when he was weeks since his mom died and they didn‚Äôt have any other cats who wanted to become his new adopted mom they all rejected feeding him and were where told he wouldn‚Äôt make it but now he‚Äôs years old and he‚Äôs weird as hell
awww i guess she knew that she d need a bit of help poor thing if she hadn t got help she may have lost one or more of her kits good for you for helping a kitty mama in need üíïüåàüòäüåàüíï
dear gosh you act like a hero and like that cat was a human be ensured the cat would have been doing fine even without your heroic move
wow grumpy must have used one of his nine lives and respawned
if you don‚Äôt keep it i will hunt you down cut off your tongue pickle it in vinegar for years then shove it down your throat with an m attached to it but if you did keep it yay thats fucking sick keep us posted
she returns with a new emotion mildly okay with the situation
cool cat but why are you holding it like you re the predator inspecting arnold schwarzenegger
the poor thing must have lost its hooman parent if you search for the lost parent make sure to ask for proof of ownership in order to ensure that the poor lost beauty goes to the correct home posting a picture will have the same reaction as on here people will want the baby to resurrect angry cat and make money off of it
why are you physically being rough in the positioning of the poor kitty
can grumpy cat be like the dhali lama and be reincarnated then the search for grumpy can must begin
grumpy cat obviously thought heaven was hell as well and said ‚Äúfuck this shit not again‚Äù
our black cat is called bastet i‚Äôd imagine for similar reasons
you‚Äôve officially got yourself an extra shadow how old
my hubby and i also have a black cat named bast short for bastet
bast is teenie i showed my black cat and she looked at me and then went back to sleep
so small and cute i just want to squeeze it to death d d d
i have a black cat named bast too she looks sort of evil but is the sweetest cat
great name still waiting on the third in that trilogy
did you know cats are almost pure liquid allowing them to fin in every crevice possible
i wish my black cat was as lanky as him instead she s super dense to the point where when she stands on you she almost hurts all that weight on those little tiny paws i don t mean fat she doesn t look overweight but boy is she heavy
blink twice if you re being held against your will bast or you know wriggle around and claw a bunch whatever works
you know that bast is that bassy jazz singer for that band in the coffee shop late at night
give bast a stroke from me also keep him away from any iron
isn t bast the goddess of cats in egyptian mythology
i used to have a black cat named bast i ve never heard of another with this name so cool
we have held our also black kitty lilly like that from when she was very little and now she loves it so much keep it up
bast bastet strange all i see is a weird outlet on a rock in the middle of the desert
that is a paw looking for a bean five if i‚Äôve ever seen it
when my parents force me to say hello to their friends
i was a little confused for a moment because bast in my language means tree bark your cat is beautiful üñ§üêà
i just really want yo visit a place like the waystone inn
i think he‚Äôs trying to scratch you for holding him weird
that little angel is on instagram cachorrinhaartista ü•∞
that dog is trained so well i hope staying like that isn‚Äôt too hard on his little neck though
impressive must‚Äôve spent so many hours training that guy
so with the apostrophe ‚Äúit‚Äôs human‚Äù means the dog is human i was expecting a very different kind of video lol
can t believe how patient he is by standing for possibly hours
the dog is loving his affection he most likely does that because he knows that‚Äôs how he likes to be cuddled yeah trained alright trained to be loved
dog is awesome but i just want to get this off my chest i really hate these statue people they are at every big tourist attraction and it fees like such an eye soar i also hate how it makes me feel like i will always be ripped off since everywhere i look feels like a money grab i love the dog though
you took a video from them but what did you give in return
a dog and it is human what kind of cronenburg horror is this
this exactly what i needed after my first toke of the day what the helllllll
these situations more than ever make me wish i could understand dog thoughts
that dog is trained pitty the camera operator isn t fuck that footage was terrible let s zoom in and out whilst walking around ahh
the guy matched his whole colour scheme to his dog too cute
this looks amazing i thought it was miniature at first
zoom in zoom out zoom in zoom out zoom in zoom out zoom in zoom out zoom in zoom out
oh come on that dog has got a little dogs dream job kisses and treats all day if it has a little neck strain when it‚Äôs older it will be well worth it and that guy will probably retire the pup to answer phones and book new gigs for him and the new ‚Äútrainee pup‚Äù
i think that s a real dog and it s not made of human at all
that dog is fabulous dahling they can have all my money
y‚Äôall remember the dog whisperer on that show he talked a lot about how dogs show dominance by placing their jaw around other dogs when the submissive dog doesn‚Äôt fight for dominance it just lays there with its neck exposed for the other dog i think that‚Äôs what this guy is doing here so it‚Äôs not trained in the way you think it just realizes his human is dominant and is doing what dogs do naturally
i rarely tip or watch street performers but i would with this one i bet that dude makes a killing
this is a very nice job by a dog he is a well trained dog
reddit seems to be blocking my comments if this has only one karma please vote so i know i m not shadow banned
i too have a chihuahua mix he does this all the time it doesn t even have to be trained
people worried about that dogs neck clearly has never seen a dog sleeping in the conner of a couch i‚Äôve seen my parents dogs lay twisted up like a pretzel for hours apron hours while in a dead sleep
lol this is in my city i ve seen those two countless times
you killed it your stupid unnecessary apostrophe killed it
awe i saw her live a few months ago that s in my hometown very cute had to give them some for it
thank you for curing my night anxiety i m going to sleep now
a statue of a dog and it‚Äôs human no it isn t punctuation is important
bring your pup to work day clearly is should be a thing
pup‚Äôs like ‚Äùi dunno whats happening but im getting all the lovings so i don‚Äôt care ‚Äù
what a fantastic companion to have by your side btw does anyone know if this a portrayal of anything specific
that s so cute that the little doggy can pose like that üòä
the human is slowly sucking the life out the poor dog that s why the dog keeps doing it less and less
wtf that is not aww at all this poor dog don t deserve to do that all day or even one hour i don t understand how y all can enjoy this video
my dog looks identical to this dog and i can t stop laughing except my dog hates having his face close to yours
disgusting he should be arrested for animal cruelty
being a living statue is hard work probably for the puppy too
he must of one day found out wow if i put my head in this postition my dog will sit here for hours then thought the only logical conclusion was to become a human statue
from the improper use of its i thought this was a statue of a dog that was a human wtf
on another note where has your life gone that you decide to dress up as a statue and stand there all day i always wonder what these guys have as a long term career plan
the dog is a well trained and nice status of human wow
now that s a fucking impressive live statue take my money üêï
the dog has this look on her face like yeah i could do this forever frozen in a moment of being loved on i won
as a vet assistant all i can think about is how perfect that pupper would be for a jugular blood draw very cute
that dog is drugged up its not even funny amp x b you realise he does this the entire day
normally i don t care but that apostrophe is bugging the hell out of me
the dog and the man can stand statue still for hours a day but the guy holding the phone can‚Äôt manage seconds of consistent framing
opens eyes yes i am currently dead please look away
it s pretty common to see beggars drug dogs to make them sleepy to get more attention so i hope this dog isn t in that siuation
he‚Äôll be coming home from with like ¬´ bitch my neck hurts like hell and all you have cooked is this crappy mac and cheese¬ª
i ve seen many street performers in my time i ve seen a bunch of street artists as well this right here is the first time i ve seen straight up street art
i swear it sounds like tim allen‚Äôs grunt mixed with the music
who pulled it off better i think your son is the winner here
please tell me you saved your fuzzy cocked bunny suit for him to wear on his st too
aweeee oh my what a cute little pumpkin and he is your twin
having a kid when you re sheesh i m and barely have the energy to wake up and work everyday
sorry to break it to you but your son is the cuter one
this must be a trick that is obviously the same child ps good job mom and or dad he s beautiful
that is absolutely awesome kudos to your mom for saving the outfit that long wonderful
you are both cuties but your son wins by a loose hair
this is so awesome such nostalgia and a eerie bonding moment
this is adorable you realize you must now save the outfit for your grandson to wear yes
very nice from the looks of it your time machine was also a washing machine
no dna test required here your son is your doppelganger
tbh you can easily pass as twins üòâ this would be a good prank
i‚Äôm pretty sure your son intentionally showed you up here
you‚Äôre and just had a son sorry but this is so fucked up and you should be ashamed that child will barely be and you‚Äôll be mostly likely dead you‚Äôre son has to do most of life without you idiot
i wish i could do this but as i was adopted i don t have any of my baby clothes i was adopted but it s never too late to start a tradition
i am very grateful to my mother in law for saving so much of my wife s clothing from when she was little it s saved us a ton of money plus since we re going through this wave of s nostalgia right now my daughter is the most stylish toddler in the neighborhood
he s so cute not gonna lie reminds me of an old school oxyclean commercial with how yellow the original looks
looks like a tide ad look how tide with bleach alternative made a shirt from the s even brighter than it was new
looks like a tide ad look how tide with bleach alternative made a shirt from the s even brighter than it was new
love this i save my kids babies clothes for this exact reason make sure to thank your mama i got a lot of flack for being a pack rat btw handsome boys
we‚Äôve got a dress that my mom aunts female cousins myself of my cousin‚Äôs daughters my niece and now another cousin‚Äôs daughter have all worn at months my mom was months old in love love love this maybe your son will continue the tradition in the far far future
this made me smile may you and your son have a happy life
awesome this is one of the best good to see pics in my life u r very lucky to have son like him and mother like her
this could be a time commercial for how white that shirt is
dude you have to put these two pictures on a t shirt and wear it when you re out with your son
what do you mean those are different pictures of your son that‚Äôs obviously before and after pictures from pewdiepie fixing his camera
after looking through your profile your son will probably be playing nms as well p
it s crazy my father and i look like twins at that age
dude i legit thought both of them were the same kid
aww adorable i think he got his eyes from his mom but he definitely got his dad s clothes
aww adorable i think he got his eyes from his mom but he definitely got his dad s clothes
aw adorable i think he got his eyes from his mom but he definitely got his dad s clothes
adorable i think he got his eyes from his mom but he definitely got his dad s clothes
out with the old in with the new sorry dad you ve been replaced by an improved version don t let the door hit you in the ass on the way out
out with the old in with the new sorry dad you ve been replaced by an improved version don t let the door hit you in the ass on the way out
i like the way old pictures look better than new pictures
one of my earlies memories is how much i hated high socks
i have a dress that my grandma wore her mom made it in the s my mom wore my sister wore i wore them my baby girl at months wore it‚Äôs kinda falling apart now i have picture collage of each of us as babies wearing it
you were much cuter than your son is but he still pretty cute
you two even have the same cowlick he s stinking adorable
gorgeous baby i love those eyes biracial babies are so perfect my daughter is white native asian d
jesus christ just when i decide we re done having kids you post this fuckin adorable picture precious
congratulations you have a very handsome young boy right there and i‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre an amazing dad
the only item of clothing that s got whiter as the years have gone on
before i read the caption or registered that it was two different photos collaged i thought it was a picture of identically dressed twins your son is adorable as were you as a baby
hey it s all good i didn t mean to be insensitive my sons canadian we live in canada now the question just asked where the parents are from so that s all i was saying my background from my parents is irish from my mom s side and german from dad s most australian are mixed race
i hope when it‚Äôs my time to have babies they come out as cute as your son cause holy jeez my ovaries are exploding
nice same nose mouth ears and forehead but the eyes i bet are from mom got to say he got nicer eyes than you all the best
man kinda jelly yer mom was all that and a bag of chips better hug her fo sho
i see he gets his looks from his mother well done just kidding but only a little
born in i did this same thing i love putting my son in some of my sweet s clothes he s and he looks awesome in plaid bell bottoms
you have an adorable mini me even down to the one year old teeth
my dad and i have similar photos in the same outfit from and
it s funny my mom did the same thing with my older brother and his son only difference is my brother was born in and my mom had some strange fixation with denim and corduroy
but your backdrop is way more badass it s like black smoke coming from a village you destroyed and you looked pleased
not bad for a picture mine had that kodak faded red on it from back then
he looks cute but i think you fill it out better which leads me to ask what can i fill you up with if you want to experiment with me sometime
your clone is very impressive you must be very proud
your son is adorable but that‚Äôs your gens my man so a win for him is a win for you
you guys are both adorable happy birthday to the little guy
you seem to have bigger arms but your baby has bigger legs so you are a power lifter and your baby will be a track star never skipping leg day
you thought you could get away with just taking two pictures of yourself
hahaha wanted to trick us by showing two of the same pics hahahahaha but you can t trick me
that‚Äôs about how my son and i compare my mother says it confuses her sometimes and she calls my son by my name she‚Äôs having parenting flashbacks
hate to tell you this but your son s cuter than you
idk what it is but your son looks more like a baby at one than you did you look like you‚Äôd respond back in full sentences
i really hope that my mom saved my first outfit for a different reason i really love her but if i have a baby then that won t be the first thing they get on
and it will be passed on to his son s son and his son s son s son and his son s son s son s son
whoa i m half a year younger but i m pretty sure i had that exact same shirt as a kid i remember the train pattern and colors
wow your baby boy is a clone of you my sister‚Äôs daughter is the same way
i like how the shirt looks cleaner now than it did years ago
baby loves the camera and it loves him right back what a beautiful smile
dog seriously karen im getting sick of your insta bullshit
until the door bell rings or he sees something out the window or anything that can trigger zooms in dog a humans reaction just isn‚Äôt fast enough to protect the baby you may think your dog is the best behaved dog ever but it only takes one time to severely hurt baby why take the risk for a cute picture no thanks
they used to be called nanny dogs i‚Äôm guessing eventually they were trained to fight and then got their bad reputation
good to know even people in this sub are biased towards pits when the stereotype come from bad owners not the dogs themselves never change people yall are so fun to laugh at
that dog massively outweighs that baby at any moment it could have an urge and kick the child off the couch with its back feet could roll over onto the child and break a rib or could become startled suddenly as most animals can be and bite the child s face amp x b you people are fucking stupid to risk the safety of a baby like this for upvotes
omg it s so tiny and it s ears are so big i m gonna die ·∂¶ ·µê ·µà·µâ·µà
well he is cuter than the baby possum i had in my kitchen the other night still don t know where the little shit went
dm the brick fencing reminds me of it if you don‚Äôt know what dm means please ignore i lived there for quite a few years and used to refer to spring as the ‚Äòsuicidal bunny season‚Äô as they would always dart across roads in front of cars ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
hold up a jack rabbit is just a hare i always thought it was like a name for a male rabbit or something also holy batman on a bike that is so freaking cute
those ears are big enough to pick up transmissions from space adorable
what type of signal does he receive with those ears üíúüíúüíúüíú‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§üê∞üê∞üê∞üê∞üê∞
there are few things i love more than baby rabbits who haven‚Äôt grown into their ears
didn‚Äôt see which subreddit this was and the entire time waiting for a hawk or an owl to swoop in
so cute i love all the little babies in spring in az baby quails chasing after the parents are so cute too
imma be real full grown jackrabbits are they ugliest motherfuckers you have ever seen they look like angry malnourished bunnies who took growth supplements
of course he is happy he is the cutest pup a phant at the happiest place on earth
cute but he‚Äôs probably just panting from sitting in the sun with a costume on
dombo and his doggie can‚Äôt handles this cuteness some one help meeeeüòçüòç
he is a very happy dog in the happiest place on earth üòÅüê∂üíô
is that not the happiest dog in the happiest place on earth that you‚Äôve ever seen üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
for fuck‚Äôs sake people this is reddit that is doggo end of discussion
the unicorn princess books were written by emily bliss so honor her original by naming her emily or bliss personally i like bliss here bliss literally calling calm and contentment to you
years i wonder how her life has unfolded that kitchen reminds me of my childhood
i had that same oven in my kitchen growing up similar kitchen paneling as well thank you for the wonderful nostalgia and memories of my childhood i wish the same level of happiness to your mom on her special day
she grew up in the west end of boston leonard nimoy from star trek worked as a paperboy for her brother
happy birthday and that is my former stove and hood
happy birthday to her and many more the kitchen immediately jumped out at me too i am assuming it is hers you can tell she has taken meticulous care of that kitchen that just stepped out of the s i love how that period would mix up browns with strong colors like red and orange and is she showing off a vintage harvest gold ge range behind her like one of the fine ladies from the price is right of yore i love it probably made countless meals in that kitchen then cleaned it to the point where you could eat off the floors she seems very proud and spry i wish her many more years to come and mountains of flowers
nice it looks like the kitchens th birthday as well they don‚Äôt make the yellow appliances anymore or did they start out white
happy birthday mom you‚Äôre so beautiful i hope you have a fun cake day pls eat a piece for me cheers
happy birthday mom she reminds me of my mom who passed away in your so lucky to have your mom cherish every second‚ô•Ô∏èüôÇ
this kitchen has gone from very modern to god awful and right back around to really cool i love it
could be can‚Äôt tell because it‚Äôs hidden behind the heart shaped spot
this is the content we needed give the pupple what they want
with that patch over his eye he s the more lovable pirate ever stealing all your treats with his cuteness
that functions much better than a nose shaped heart
hi mormon here hate peanut butter love puppies ever heard of dang i wonder how many spots there are i heard that dalmations was based on the somewhat silly study to find out the average number of spots on dalmations turns out it was though i m not sure how many were involved in the studie
dalmatians are one of the most beautiful dogs a shame they have almost as many health problems as they do spots
i wasn t paying attention and for a split second i saw his paws as human hands
quick question was that adorable pupper the rd pup born if so there is a on its chest
when it pokes you with its nose it means it loves you very much
sooooo sad we must have the same puppers because that‚Äôs exactly what mine look like in the bath
what age trying to figure out when to bath mine to üòäüëçüêï
what age trying to figure out when to bath mine üòäüëçüêï
this in my doggo in the bath but immediately following he has zoomies for ten minutes
its know as a female caucasian typically a nice breed but the short haired types tend to be a bit aggressive
i don t know but the lady looks like my piano teacher when i was
you guys are super wholesome and i wish you all the happiness you can handle
post pics along the way engagement wedding adoption certificate happy family
is she accepting more adoptions i and the commenters below me would like to join the family
bit of a dick move to announce it to the world before he s even asked her but congratulations
wair a second if this gets to the front page tonya sue might find out through op whom she seems to feel very fond of about the proposal because it sounds like tonya sue was not proposed to by op s dad yet reddit we can be part of this proposal if we get to the front page don t let me down
oh full story please this post makes my heart happy
that is so amazing i am so happy for all of you guys üòÅüòä
this picture is incredibly adorable congrats on everything d
i would ask her to adopt me too but that would be weird because i m probably her age could she adopt me as her sister my sisters are estranged from the entire family üòï

aw cute wish i could upvote twice my grandpa restored edsels
they look so happy congratulations to dad tonya sue and op‚Äôs family
i feel like edsels are either a love or hate type of car i know people who love the look and despise the look i m just a car guy so i like things with wheels wish them the best
many happy days to all of you thank heaven for good women
never mind that shit that‚Äôs a great looking car what is it and obviously the best of happiness to your dad and his future wife
you can feel and see the happiness in this photo wishing all the best to all of you üíú
i‚Äôm obviously weird i‚Äôve always thought that once you decide to get married you are engaged i find the idea of planning to be become engaged odd you can plan to make it official by buying a ring and having an official party i guess anyway that‚Äôs apparently just me all the very best to happy couple and family
i m loving the edsel coincidentally i found a edsel hubcap today
wishing you your dad and tonya sue every happiness and success in the future
its amazing when you are with the one you feel god made just for you
that s a pretty edsel i love those cars good luck with the wedding
bittersweet on one hand how did such a special and intimate moment end up on reddit however wow very moving
c‚Äômon tears in my eyes while my family and i are sitting in the theatre hyped up to watch john wick very touching moment i‚Äôm glad the dad has room in his heart for a new best friend
this actually made me cry i have actual tears streaming down my cheeks
gt you‚Äôve come back to me tells me he hasn‚Äôt really let his last pups go poor guy wish his family would let him grieve first i‚Äôm sure lumo‚Äôs helped but dang lumo‚Äôs gonna be held to some high standards
i cried and hugged my dog i would do the exact same thing we don t deserve these companions
beautiful gift but perhaps a little too early to get a new companion he is obviously hurting so badly animals can tell when we are sad it impacts them deeply i do not disagree with the gift my heart goes out to this family but people do need time to grieve and let the grief soften a bit he is clearly devastated
why do people put these intimate vulnerable moments in the internet
why do people put these intimate vulnerable moments in the internet i hate it
damn i wish i had friends who cared for me like he cared for his dog
cute dog but i winced when this grieving dad said you ve come back to me it does not seem like this was a good time to get this man a puppy even when he was out of the grieving stage maybe something like a kitten or a bunny would have been a better option create a gap between the lost dog then after a while maybe a different breed of dog i got the impression that the same breed he lost was given to him again before he was finished grieving the last one just makes it a lot harder to psychologically process his emotions i really hope this man feels better and is soon able to create a unique and healthy bond with the new puppy
üò≠üò≠üò≠i cant stop crying this is sooo precious i hope those two have a wonderful journey together‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
it s that weird ugly cute with skin too big for its body
cute in that looks like a kid in a rhino suit kind of cute
i‚Äôm listening ‚Äúif i could turn back time‚Äù and it surprisingly lines up
one horned rhinos are just genetically altered unicorns made for war primarily unused in bce it was the cutest tank around and only it‚Äôs use for adorable internet gifs picked up around and the biped monkeys love them
i want to know what that weird looking skin feels like
she s a maniac maniac on the floor and she s dancing like she s never danced before
he could have been having an epileptic fit amp was dying amp everyone is like oohh so cute
the rain makes it look more majestic would do again
we recently had baby pandas too mon deau they were cute
how can it be so armored and squishy at the same time
i realised this is the first time i see a wet rhino
is there a reason why this rhino seems to have that silver color around its pupil i am use to seeing pictures of rhino with all black eyes can this be because it is still so young
intense s music can be heard in the distance she s a maniac maniac on the floor and shes dancin like she s never danced before baby dance rhino spins and lands in chair foot up and pointed out pulls chord water falls over baby rhino
who did the cops kill this time or are they still on the copaganda offensive after killing the pregnant woman
hey congrats that‚Äôs awesome tell her reddit is proud
"ain t about how fast i get there

donut looks so much like my bunny when he washes his little squishy face
funny thing about lops is if you lift one s ears up it is a completely different bunny

smaller mammals like rats and mice don t get enough love on this sub for sure i love your boyz u

what species of cuddly rodent is the larger one a hamster
make sure you take the cap away as soon as it comes off
make sure you take the cap away as soon as it comes off
cute dog make sure you take the cap away as soon as it comes off though
cute up until he she does get the cap off amp accidentally swallows it or chokes i m speaking from experience please take the cap off
it s cut up until he she gets the cap off amp chokes on it i m speaking from experience please remove the cap
yorkies are so darn cute what a great personality on yours
it s cute until he she gets the cap off amp chokes on it i m speaking from experience please take it away
so cute my dog does this and gets water all over my bed
how cute my boston always always opens water bottles he will leave the lid on the floor and chew on the bottle until someone will fetch it with him or he ll taunt the cat for playtime smart boy will never eat the cap though animals are amazing
my little terrier could unzip a backpack take out a lunchbox open that and eat all the food without damaging anything i‚Äôm sure he will figure it out
my floofer hasn‚Äôt met a kennel box or waterbottle she couldn‚Äôt open lol amp not by trashing them by figuring out how to twist amp pull between her teefs amp paws it‚Äôs kind of amazing how smart they can be your furbaby is adorbs‚ù§Ô∏è
our dog can get the kid off these in minutes or less
now let s hear the real video without the music just to be sure
repost i literally saw this yesterday or day before
i bet with this shitty music the real sound is the owner telling the dog the commands to do the tricks
fuck off repost and as stated on previous post days ago the shitty music is covering the vocal commands also other hand isn t visable so hand signals were also suggested
pretty sure doggo is being a good floof and following hand signals off screen
literally could be the owner behind the camera doing hand signals or saying commands
that s mayapolarbear she s got a lot of vids on yt cute and smart samoyed
the only trick my dog knows is to play dead for hours
congratulations on your fake video of the day award
even if they were giving the dog signals still a well done video and that dog is adorable
maya is best pupperino i get vv excite when i see her
lol no audio what a joke also could very well be someone behind her giving hand gestures
nope just someone behind the camera prompting the dog
that is amazing me training a dog at the age of me no dog seriously it seems like everything is on the do not murder list seriously i think you are asking a bit much from me
all i see is a big white floof and some hands holding a phone üòñ
this entire thread its hand signals no its probably voice comands no sound his eyes are suggesting i am right about the hand signals theres no sound
give that good boye some treats he s so cute with his little barks and looking attentively for the next images to be shown to him
as soon i saw this i thought this must be some asian and it is damn they are smart
oh my god my heart is going to burst this is so cute
hey guys this is an awwww video not an avenger breakdown
damn he she follows through instructions better than my dumb butt in class
that s mayasmr from youtube y all should definitely check out the crunch asmr videos cutest thing ever
so what if the owner is giving commands behind the music it s still a cute video
oh wow it s the same post but with different music technology has come so far hasn t it
only some dogs can see tv or electronic screen my dog do not watch tv whereas her litter mate gets fully engaged watching tv shows maybe this one just can see well very cute
cute doesn t even begin to describe this adorable floofer
off screen just giving the dog commands with hand gestures
cool except for all the other hand signs and gestures
yes let‚Äôs repost the same shit with the same false title
or he s just doing the tricks to verbal commands or sign language from her other hand
does the watermark in the bottom right count as giving credit
guys her name is maya she has her own youtube channel called mayapolarbear check her out for more adorable videos she s such a good pupper ‚ù§Ô∏è
i know everyone is concerned about the liability of this video but my deepest concern is what kind of dog this is
i like to think i didn‚Äôt rescue my rescue dogs they rescued me
when the one fren does all the talking and the other quiet fren uses enthusiastic body language for support
theyre just trying to tell you about their adventure they ve been on maybe found some fox poo they ate in the garden
common karen we obviously need you to give us all the belly rubs and head scratches pronto
my dog looks exactly like the brown one exactly it‚Äôs blowing my mind
whenever dogs are about to talk their eyes get really big and one eyebrow is higher than the other
oh man what if we got this giant bunny and the giant main coon kitty together to either battle or battle buddies
fuck me imagine hearing him thump when he s angry you can hear a dwarf thump when you re on a different floor never mind this giant
does it poop out tenisballs and chew doors imagine when it digs at the floor
what a unit this big boy needs more than carrot per meal
are we sure that s a rabbit and not somebody s lost toddler still in costume from an easter gala because nobody has noticed
that thing is enormous that creature is like the capybara of rabbits
what are you guys talking about its obviously eeyore from winnie the pooh
is that why the easter bunny missed my house this year
it s kinda creepy when small things animals get bigger than usual
ohhhhh looks so lovely i want to meet a giant bunny like this ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
at first glance when scrolling i thought that was adam sandler
that‚Äôs one giant floofer you got there also incase you are unaware you kinda look like justin gaethje mma fighter
where can i get one and do they shed a lot have a lot of health problems require constant grooming
now i have to see what these look like when they hop brb
goddamn it i need to get off the internet for a while because i was expecting a picture of a raccoon
how is this a rabbit this is the earthly form of big chungus
is that a flemish giant but it has lop ears so a flemish lop mix but it is still so huge
damn that rabbit has the hind paws of a large dog never knew rabbits could become so big he is really cute though
jesus christ can you imagine coming across that thing in the middle of the night
the fluffy rabbit isn t the only cute thing here damn
oh my god that cute angel i m so happy you posted this for us all to see d
what are you feeding that thing its bigger than my dog
i have never thought someone from my kind will be that big how much carrots did you eat my dude
for those who are curious this is a french lop they weigh pounds and can get pretty big however the biggest rabbit breed is called the flemish giant the adults can be around pounds and feet long
damn he must make a serious mess awesome looking though
the legendary esquilax a horse born with the head of a rabbit and the body of a rabbit
‚Äúi‚Äôll take all the produce please it‚Äôs for my bunny ‚Äù
wow i never have seen a big rabbit bevor is as big like a dog what type is this where do you keep him had a small field rabbit as a kid we kapped him in the house freely and he had his box to go in to do his business
that‚Äôs a costume right there‚Äôs a big pupper or kitty in there actually though the ears look a little fake but hell i‚Äôve never seen a rabbit that big before anyways so what do i know
did anyone else notice the michael scott plasma tv on the wall
cute but kinda scary my cats aren t that big what breed is it
what the actual fuck i feel like i m tripping i don t think i m high ¬ø still cute af but freaks me the fuck out
this has to be a diablo monster or something at this point
why does the rabbit have a please sir i apologize for anything that i may have done to offend you look on its face
wow that rabbit is so big he could probably wear the dude s shorts can we get another picture of him holding the bunny except with his short on the bunny
i did not know you actually procured a rhosgobel rabbit from middle earth kudos
whoa i thought easter was over what s bunny doing here collecting tooth for the tooth fairy
it‚Äôs all fun and cute until that rabbit drags you by the foot into the basement at am
all i can think about is that malcomb in the middle episode
if this rabbit isn t the original inspiration for the word floofy then what is
that s going to make a nice single piece jacket with pants or costume for a kid when it passes away
big chugus has entered our dimensions to conquer it
is it sad that i m probably the size of that rabbit
i bet he could eat a two pound bag of kale for a snack
look at her happy face ü•∞üêæ rescued dogs are the best great job
thats sweet of you to wait to eat until her food comes out
ok doggo is cute but that plate of british pub chips which appear to have been cooked to my exact preferred level of crunchiness looks divine where is this anyway looks like a great spot for lunch
do you ever wonder if there s a language barrier between dogs from different countries like their barks are just gobbledegook to one another
well as i am a romanian that sweet looking girl would be in a shelter without any food i gotta thank you for what you did for her love you meela have a nice day op
was she dropped off a few days ago how was she with opening up i think we got our dogs from the same thing as my little pup man was dropped off a few days ago from romania
i mean if it s been cut up and cooked can you call it rescued
why is there a napkin between the dish and the food
this is a picture of your burger and fries not of your dog lmao
this dog is more sophisticated than i and i would appreciate if she stopped silently judging me
edit living a dog s best life by the seaside in the uk
we rescued our dog from romania as well did you adopt from pawprints to freedom
seaside towns in the uk are shitholes really past their prime just like this dog
she‚Äôs adorable but as an english person who wants to do a seaside holiday soon can you tell me what that restaurant is called and where it is because those chips look amazing
why would you rescue a burger name it and take it back to the uk
i mean if you‚Äôre going to name a meal meela is a fine name to choose i‚Äôve just never thought of naming a burger and fries before i‚Äôm gonna go have a kevin in a couple hours
that s a lovely dog and name i don t know if the name is intended or not but meela would sound exactly as the romanian word mila which means the mercy
rescued from romania what did the romanians do to her
i am expecting a seagull to swoop in and snatch something off that plate while knocking the rest to the ground
can you rescue me aswell i promise i don t eat much
rescued from romania whilst rescue dogs in the uk are killed every day
haha we have a romanian rescue called karina who looks very similar
rescued from romania is the best thing that can happen to any species
why is the tomato under the meat is it a jersey thing
what i wanna know is how you gonna fit that massive burger in your mouth also those are very english fries
that is an adorable french fry all poking out like that
rather see more romanian dogs in the uk than romanian gypsies coming for benefits for their kids
did it ever occur to you that it might be scary for her to live in a country where she may not speak the language
my mother has a romanian rescue mellowest dog i ve ever met happy to curl up next to you his only issue seems to be getting taken out for walks by relative strangers like me at first if i m visiting where he will be very wary or sometimes just stop and want to go home he was abandoned by his original family so we wonder if he might have issues left over from that
i hope you bought him something meaty to eat with you not just look at you eating he seems like a good dog
all i can think is sea side in the uk they must be freeeeezing
cute is the food for the dog or you hope puppy gets some treats to enjoy the view
my dog is from romania and looks very similar do you have a full body photo of meela
typical romanians coming over here taking our dogs jobs s meela is adorable
i don t understand which one is the star of the pic the plate or the dog
cute dogo but are you sure she s originally from romania she looks more hungarian to me
i would also like to be rescued to live seaside in the uk
she looks so happy my boss just got a romanian rescue dog too and we were talking about it yesterday i had no idea it was such a problem for them over there good on you for rescuing
that gypsy will stole your food and four heart awww
a real rarity that is how often does someone rescue a fine meal such as that and tame it i wish the best of luck on your journey
glad to see people choose to rescue dogs from romania
i think my girlfriend and i met you and meela in hasting a few weeks back very sweet girl
rescued from romania sounds a little too harsh doesn t it
this can t be in the uk that food actually looks good
can you go rescue the dogs left i would really appreciate it so tired about stray dogs everywhere when i go visit my bro
the eastern europe stray dog import business is a plague
huh i didn t know that brits named their romanian sandwiches
she‚Äôs just sitting there knowing she ordered three peoples worth of food
i m interested in how she ordered that food can she talk or does the waiter speak borkish
why not support your local dog rescue by re homing one of their dogs
she looks about as excited as i feel hungry staring at those frys
your playing it fast and loose with a plate of chips outside next to the sea how many chips did you get to eat before a herring gull came and nabbed them
bloody romanian dogs comin‚Äô over here and being cute at our seasides
that reminds me of when i was working on a movie set down in atlanta ga and one of the costumers found this stray small dog in a not so good part of town sleeping under the bridge now that dog lives in la with her and spend his time with famous people on movie sets
why are impossibly tall sandwiches a thing learn to stack bichez
i don t know why but i picture you going undercover to rescue meela in a romanian death camp after the initial escape from camp you had to lose a slew of spies that were tailing you in a john wick fashion until you finally reached asylum in the uk where it s now agreed upon that you two are to live peacefully for the rest of your days enjoy the uk while you can and beware of the sequel where you ll be forced into your past life through tragedy
can i please be rescued from morocco and live by the aeaside in the uk as well
rescued from romania the fuck is romania auschwitz for dogs or something
maybe im just cynical but the majority of these rescue posts i feel are just used to pull heartstrings for karma just my imput
a good meal and a cute dog seriously the life i want
thats a nice looking polar b i mean dog from romania
ahhh yes we also have a romanian rescue hope she‚Äôs having the time of her life as our dog is
that s cute it looks like two are having dinner together
awww you named your lunch meela that s sweet who s cute dog is that
my dogs are also romanian rescues they re both the most cuddly loving dogs i ve ever met one of them was in a kill shelter until the charity rescued her and the other lived on the streets for a few years
eating one animal whilst taking a picture of another
britain is so small that as soon as i saw you said ‚Äòthe uk‚Äô and looked at that wall i immediately recognised it
so glad she found a home currently volunteering for an animal shelter here in romania and god damn we have a shitty situation
burgers go to shit these days but dogs will always be rad
is it common to just let your boat get beached during low tide that seems like a really low tide oh yeah cute dog too
plenty of dogs to be rescued here in the uk i cannot understand why people import animals when there is a shelter a mile from their address
ohhhh i love your smile meela i hope to visit the seaside soon too love from london ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
cool another dog living a better life than of humans
that s a happy puppers amp x b you re a good person for rescuing
it s a lovely thing to do however if you re thinking of doing the same please be aware that rescue dogs from romania can often have a lot of complex and expensive problems they can also turn quite violent and there character can change if you keep them in the house especially the ones that are used to wondering the streets source my wife s a vet and she sees quite a lot of romanian rescues
never met a romanian that was worth it hope it goes well for you
looks like she s enjoying the leigh on sea sunshine
meela patiently waiting for her food to arrive good pup
what a classy animal all enjoying a seaside meal at a nice restaurant
i would like to be rescued from america to live seaside in the uk
meela did you name her that way if not it‚Äôs prob mela coming from melania romanian name
yay for the peterboat their chowder is great be sure to check out leigh folk festival next month
i don t care about your sandwich and chips what s the dog s name
this is by the peterboat in leigh in sea and that s my dog derpo
do you always give your food a name before you eat it also your date is ugly what we in the states would call a real dog
my best friend rescued a dog from romania and we live in the uk but in london so he probably won‚Äôt get to go to the beach oftem
thank you so much for rescuing a romanian dog there are so many neglected dogs there who are absolutely lovely once you help them
my dog is named myla and my friend always pronounced her name meela
aw that s awesome just got back from romania and i couldn t believe how many dogs were wandering around we were told not to approach them as they were likely unvaccinated and potentially dangerous where d you find your new buddy
i was worry a bit because my focus was on hamberger and the title made me think the other way
i have a romanian rescue in the uk too very different to this doggo though
also have a romanian rescue in the uk such little loveable softies
meela looks like she is living the life good for her and she looks adorable
hey op how did you get a dog from romania into the uk is there a passport or jabs or anything that needed doing i‚Äôd be interested to hear the story
yeah yeah sea boats rescue blah blah great now how about passing a chip
we have a romanian rescue too her name is trisha and she is just ridiculous lt
omg those fries look good or do you call them crispys or something like that over there
funny story i knew a dog who was adopted at about or it seemed like it was well trained and waiting for orders but it didn t seem to know what you were saying they had a friend come over who was east european or something like that and the dog really seemed to like him once he started speaking in his native tongue they realized the dog was welled trained just not in english
she‚Äôs beautiful did you get her via a charity i‚Äôve got a romy as well from a charity called barking mad dog rescue
why rescue a dog from romania when we have so many that need adopting in the uk
you know that there are so many of these useless bastards in the uk just adopt one of them if you‚Äôre stupid enough to adopt one of these things
do you call those french fries fries or chips or something else

give that baby a french fry and congratulations on your new family member
looks like meela is living the good life are you taking in any more rescues if so i m interested
looks like you are about to rescue her from hungary too
made an account to say this will probably get down voted into another dimension but here goes allthough i admire and appreciate the idea of rescuing dogs from poor countries there are two things we should keep in mind it s very probable that a portion of the exported rescue dogs are in commercially bred if one does not take care to make sure the franchise is legitimate adopting such dogs would by contributing to the business cause more harm than it does good please please make sure they have gotten all the vaccination and paracite treatments required to enter the country
one of the goodest boys i‚Äôve seen yet i rate him a very good boy
that s sweet and all but i m just staring at your fries
omg my sister fostered meela while she was waiting for you guys glad she has settled in and hope she is thriving with youüòä
we interrupt this program to bring you meela the adorable dog show starring meela the adorable dog abandoned as a pup she was found by op who lives in the middle of the sea with her husband eustace bagge but creeeeeeeepy stuff happens in the uk it s up to meela to save her new home
can you rescue me too living by seaside in uk is my dream
so is this a food instagram thing with a rescue dog are you desperate for attention or is that meal for the dog no what a loser
i bet it‚Äôs hard to resist the urge to gobble all that food up
i m from romania and dogs here are treated pretty bad
meela has become desensitized to the seaside she is now captivated by the f√ºd
we ve got beaches in the uk so who the fuck wants to see them
honestly i think i d prefer running wild in romania than with some fat englishman
i cant believe you named your cow then ate your pet
why did he need rescue was he a pawlitical prisoner
you rescued it and turned it into a burger which you ate in front of its brethren you disgust me
its cool and all that people are naming food now but whats up with that dog it looks like its about to eat meela
this is probably the best picture i‚Äôve seem on reddit
i see meela is eating a burger and fries where‚Äôs yours
why did you rescue a dog from romania just curious are there a lot of dogs in romania in need of rescue
so cute it s nice the dog is now having a nice life
rescued from romania did you steal some shepperd s dog and called it a rescue üòÇüò≠
the burger looks like a hockey puck and who the fuck puts fries on top of a receipt
i could tell it was the uk by looking at the ungodly shapes of those fries cute puppy though
my parents adopted a stray puppy from romania about two months ago super cute
she‚Äôs cute but it looks like you were taking a picture of your food and the dog happened to be in the background we need her front and center
the british veterinary association is urging animal lovers not to rescue dogs from abroad because they pose a health risk to uk pets the surge in numbers of rescue dogs being brought into britain from other countries could expose homegrown pooches to deadly exotic diseases vets warn the trojan rescue dogs risk exposing britain s pet dogs and people to a range of infections the british veterinary association said
meela looks amazing a wonderful pet indeed the dog is cute too
is rescuing a dog from romania a common thing my friends aunt owns a romanian rescue in france
in some countries there‚Äôs a ton of stray dogs and cats in athens greece a stray dog followed my group for a good hour plus while we walked through some ruins i almost wanted to take it home gave it some food and a nickname
chips and a smiling girl by the seaside what could be better
rescued from romania i d rather live in romania than in the uk the girls are way prettier brexit is a distant nightmare and dogs don t have to pose for karma
‚Äúperhaps if i sit here like hooman i will get served next‚Äù
if the dog is anything like romanians you better eat that food before it steals it
i‚Äôm sorry but i feel bad for the british when it comes to food that looks dreadful
romanian dogs be like trannsylvania is and will always be romanian clay
one thing i can say is be careful with your friend if you or other friends speak romanian i know adopted romanian dogs who have literally wet themselves in fear and been unable to settle for hours after just hearing a couple of sentences
all those french fries are in serious need of ketchup
leigh on sea is a lovely place glad yous are enjoying it d
i don t get it though why are soooo many people rescuing dogs from romania and other eastern european countries when we have plenty of dogs that already need rescuing over here in the uk this is a genuine question as my brothers wife just took in a dog from romaninia costs loads yet our local rescue is virtually giving them away
sorry about eurovision doggo your country was robbed
cute dog and all but damn do i want to steal a chip they look so freaking good
doesn t this break the subs rules of no sad and sob stories
i don‚Äôt typically name my sandwiches but good on you
thats weird to name your food like that dog looks happy though
we have dogs from romania rescues where you get yours from in romania
makes me wonder can you freely travel across the eu with your pets do you need special paperwork
so ill ask the question what kind of quarantine time did you have to wait to bring her into the country
this would be a much darker post if meela turned out to be a cow
this is the most blessed picture i have ever seen thank you
dog s got a better life than most people in romania now
i ve got the same face as that dog looking at that plate
well it says the pic is in the uk not the one warm part of it guys quit with dislikes uks mostly freezing
"stop with ‚Äúrescued‚Äù unless you pulled your dog out of the ocean or caught the beast as it was about to be sucked into a wood chipper it‚Äôs not rescued more like stolen
‚Äúthis is the dog i stole from some romanians ‚Äù"
thank you for giving meela the best life melts my heart
please rescue me too compared to meela i can work and pay taxes
what was the process to get him to the uk i remember reading they had very intense quarantine periods
i also have a romanian rescue dog and live in a uk seaside town
sweet doggo but your food looks disgusting lol sorry
my friend has a romanian street dog too her name is ling she arrived with no hair mange and bad lungs she‚Äôs now fighting fit with a beautiful coat
mela pronounced meela means apple in italian now i can‚Äôt stop thinking your dog‚Äôs name is apple
the dog is an eu immigrant and i just had a ukip leaflet posted through my door i m sure ukip would want this cute dog deported because it isn t british enough
how did you teach her english must me a cultural shock for her
buddy and wolf say hello from in land also romanian rescues will pay dog tax when able
was this photo taken in a pub called the peter boat
is anyone else upset with the ratio of patty to bun
you guys are so lucky to have such well behaved dogs my frenchie is an eating machine and will lunge at any food in sight
i m a little bothered by how much smaller that meat patty is compared to the bun
damn this looks like leigh on sea where i live lovely little spot during the summer great pubs and music and they are so accommodating to people with animals it s great u afacebehindacamera
that leigh on sea peterboat love that pub and good on you for saving her
this is the most by the seaside in the uk photo in the world
awww she looks really happy thanks for rescuing her
that s a nice looking meela but a strange way to pronounce meal
im so happy about her im living in the balkans and here everybody s buying dogs the people seldom adopt them and the most dogs are send to the west countries hope soon the situation changes ü§ûü§û
meela looks pretty good what kind of sandwich is she
meela means mercy in romanian but spelled mila sounds the same though
that‚Äôs awesome she looks like she‚Äôs enjoying the good life
awww she s lovely my friend also has a romanian rescue and he s such a happy dog hope meela is happy too d
i hope she s not not here taking a british dogs work away from them similarly i also hope she s not claiming english kibble welcome meela boops
oh my god those chips are some of the most heavenly looking potato pillows i ve ever seen
why didn t you just get a rescue from your local shelter
didnt expect to see leigh on sea on reddit lovely doggo
thats nice i am surprised you found some sunshine fam london has been awful weather
spot all the vertical things in this picture to prove you re not a bot y all missed the dog y all going have to pay money now no regards whatsoever comcast
"dog would pet
food i do not miss the food in the uk"
well this is my first comment after years on reddit wtf is with this title rescued from romania rescued from china would be a better title there are at least more waiting to be rescued in romania and you should start with people first i have a dog an european one if you know what i mean he lives in romania and it is rescued from romania he s not living on the seaside he is living on my side and he is happy because i love him and he loves me there are billions of dogs waiting to be rescued just fging don t brag about it because it looks just like you want to be a saviour it doesn t look like you really love the dog change the title put china
good for you romania its a shit country who doesn t take care of anything as bill burr will say go ü¶Ü ur self
being romanian living in the us and knowing about the problems with stray dogs and the lack of shelters this makes me happy good on you
thought it was a picture of the food at first and i was like damn that s brutal then i saw the dog
he‚Äôs smiling because he loves you so much for rescuing him op good job you‚Äôre the best thing to happen to him in his world
this picture is obviously british solely based on the shape of the fries
i underatand why you had to rescue him her from romania it is a trash country
i was in the mountains in romania for a couple of days and nights a few years back there were so many wild doggos out there it was nuts you could hear them barking from all directions at night really creepy glad this very good girl made it to a good home
i d show this to my parents but they d no doubt complainabout this foreigner coming over and taking advantage of our country
adorable it‚Äôs a shame so few rescue dogs are this sweet mostly just shit bulls
how did you get them to let you take the pup from romania we rescued a stray puppy living alone in a trash pile and found a local family friend to take it but we really wanted to bring it back to the states with us
why did you name your hamburger also why did you wait to get back to the uk from romania to eat it
i ll love you forever if you give me a bite of that burger
she looks like a sweetie pie but thanks to this post i now really want chips
partially disappointed that it s not fish amp chips
you can tell the dog is romanian just by the way it is
looks like a picture of your food with her i the background üò¨
that s kinda weird that you rescued and named your sandwich cute dog though
meet my cat nala rescued from normal people now living in a bedroom apartment way to make me feel like my cat is missing out on a better life happy for the puppy dog
romanian dogs are displacing brit dogs in sympathy adoption demographics
i love foxes but don‚Äôt get organisation xiii have them
thanks for using the word vulpine it s a great word
holy shit just realized vulpix is a combination of vulpine and fox
do they look cute kinda wait until you hear them scream in the middle of the night sounds like someone dying
how do i get one as a pet i have one sad looking one that lives on my street and i try feeding it but it never comes up to me
he loves me he loves me yup he loves me he loves me yup dog probably
i really really needed to see this right now thank u
i always tell my dogs to keep their eyes open on walks for dropped change
mr steal your girl your heart your man your family your friends and enemies
goes to replies to type a funny original t h i c c joke sees replies ah
it s actually almost disappointing as fur is so unbelievably soft that you can barely feel anything at all it s like petting a cloud
now that s a perfect example of why the fur looks the best on the animal rather than on a bony human body
if anybody touches him and messes up his perfect hair y all gonna get slaps
fun fact their fur is so dense that fleas tend to just suffocate when they land on them
the real life mogwai must never get it wet or feed it after midnight
chinnie butts are the best butts so soft and fluffy
a guy would be crazy to take on those three without a super power of some sort
cat gambling is an up and coming industry you thank your lucky stars you got in on the ground floor
ah the crushing loneliness that hits after moving out of communal housing
what breed is it my uncle had the same one and i wanna get one too
it‚Äôs funny how puppies have this sad look and when older they look more alert
i bet that s one annoying piece of crap used to be cute though
aww i love rack russels they will always have a special place in my heart ‚ù§Ô∏è
goes from i m not sure i like this place to this is my castle peasants in the span of those photos
i couldn‚Äôt figure out why someone would get their stuffed animal dog muddy with their real dog then i realized they‚Äôre both real dogs and my brain hurts
little one are you sure the humans aren t mad at us for getting dirty cloud boi just smile at them like this and be happy with our work
on second thought you might want to just run a comb through them
they look like polar bears and fun fact polar bear fur is actually clear and polar bear skin is actually black
two dirty doggos jumped in the mud won t tell on dad faith in the blood
the one on the right is an intellectual and knows what the hooman will do to them that being hose them with waterguns
the puppy has this look like i only did it because he told me to this is his fault the older one is like mud mud is my favorite
dirty doggos done dirt cheap the name of my new dog grooming business
one on the left zero shame one on the right still remembers his manners are doesn‚Äôt like disappointing people
mud mud i love mud i‚Äôm absolutely positively wild about mud can‚Äôt go around it have to go through it beautiful fabulous super duper mud
one looks so proud of themself and the other looks like they‚Äôre rethinking their life choices üòÇüòÇ
aww this made me remember an old joke dad doggo and son doggo come home from the zoo dad covered in shit and son covered in piss mom doggo asks what the heck happened son doggo smirks ah nothing i just pissed myself laughing when i saw dad slip and dive snout first in a big pile of buffalo shit
samoyeds this dog breed have a self cleaning coat so they can get very dirty and go back to white and poofy within a few hours on their own
lol mine can find any mud at the dog park every other dog there will be clean and my morons will be covered in mud
the one on the right is just like ‚Äúi‚Äôm so done with this s ‚Äú
damn with enough reposts even cute stuff gets stale
you call it dirt i call it a healthy layer of earth
the difference of expressions might have something to do with how deep the mud was on the left it was perfect for running and swimming on the right i thought i was gonna drown
dad she seems mad no it s cool just do this pant thing they love it they can t possibly stay mad
pupper dude karen looks pissed doggo no she s definitely scowling with joy
hopefully not as psychotic and stalkerish as the other conrads i ve come across in the galaxy
just stop posting this already i‚Äôve seen this image times today
they didn t do it it might look like they did it but they didn t
i think it s pretty likely that humans did this to these doggies why are their faces so clean
i‚Äôd totally pay you if i could wrassle with your dogs in the mud
copyright notice sounds like youtube to me but okay
to maintain the balance your boyfriend will scare other men and your horse will scare other horses
i m assuming the horse probably has a pretty good reason to not like men boyfriend is probably just intimidated by those majestic beasts lol
it s interesting that animals know who they trust even if they are scared
this wouldn t work with an arachnophobe and your friendly pet spider let me tell you straight now
as a man that is scared of horses why would people ride a thing with a mind of it s own it doesnt have to listen to you it just takes one wild ride into the woods and you and the horse are gone this is encouraging
animals being scared of x y or z usually isn t rather its us projecting an interpretation i learned this with a dog i had we thought was racist and a hater of small kids turns out he couldn t see very well and picked up on the anxiety we felt introducing him to small kids
horses are just big dogs tell him that it s true then show him hilarious horse videos
i ve seen a lot of horses that are afraid of men it s usually because they are afraid of getting shoed and it s usually a man doing that
my girlfriend has two horses and wants me to ride them one day i think horses are beautiful animals but they scare the hell out of me their big teeth freak me out and my balance isn t good so i m scared i ll either get my hand crushed in their mouth somehow or i ll fall off and get stomped on i still pet them on the snout because i am an animal lover at heart but i do so very warily i hope i do get over my fear of horses so i can go with her on horse rides and have fun
i don‚Äôt trust horses either or squirrels shifty little bastards
i‚Äôm not scared of horses i‚Äôm just uneasy around them
i m not scared of horses but i am scared of riding horses you re putting a lot of trust in a very large and strong animal
your boyfriend seems nice and the guy with the glass looks cool too
i can feel the apprehension from here damn that shits real me with cats
while i m not afraid of horses per se i have a very healthy respect for the damage one can do to a person i consider a horse like a piece of heavy machinery
it s because they have something they like in common
he should be scared of horses fuck a horse i don t trust them as far as i can throw them
huh this person could of just took this photo and then added this context just to make the story more appealing cause it‚Äôs just a photo of a man and a horse
this is beautiful actually brought a tear to my eye
tell your boyfriend not to feel bad i m in a similar situation i m afraid of girls who own horses i just had a couple that just had bad temperaments threw me off kicked me stepped on me etc
fake internet points and i‚Äôm not saying you did but you could of
i don t care what anyone says horses are terrible people
i believe that animals will be what you treat them as it s all about respect patience and compassion
then chad and brad ran in to bully them both completely ruining the wonderful moment in that terrible moment they shouted and neighed north ridge equestrians rule get dunked nerds in celebration of their rival equestrian facility now her bf and horse must train to beat them in the upcoming competition you figure out which one was the horse
apples work well i am finding out the horse always used to act spooked when i was anywhere near it s been about apples now over weeks and she walks right up o me now but isn t distressed if i don t have an apple
how does a horse know a man from a women what about transgender what about shania twain man i feel like a woman
i see this and am jealous that your boyfriend has people around him that allow him to be afraid
i know them feels i scared of horses there was an incident
well at least it s you who s the glue bringing them together
little bay that‚Äôs what i‚Äôm going to call them now looks like my best friend‚Äôs horse noah what breed are they also do you have any others
everyone should fear horses imagine being locked in a room with one that wanted to kill you
interesting maybe because i‚Äôve lived in a city all my life the only folks who had anything to do with horses were really wealthy
he should be out not inside the cage we evil humans üòî
‚Äúaww look how cute this animal is good thing we‚Äôve imprisoned it so we can force it to live by our will and commodify it‚Äôs natural beauty nature is so amazing uwu‚Äù fuck y‚Äôall
every time i see a tiger my heart explodes with joy and love they are absolutely one of the most beautiful cat species on the planet
it is my duty to gently grab every blep i ever see my cat is very fast i would try this one i know it ll cost me an arm but looook at it
this is a pretty sad living situation for a tiger üòø
is this at a zoo rescue because that cage looks a lot like a zoo rescue i visited a few years back
i know he‚Äôd kill me but i just wanna smoosh that face
can anybody tell me why they put tongue like that my cat does the same thing just curious
i smelt my cat when i saw this and it seemed like i was there just for a moment
i‚Äôm quite certain this is one of the tigers at care rescue texas there‚Äôs a youtuber called bigcatderek who owns runs it with his wife this is in one of the lockdown areas all the tigers and lions have access to open areas too since most of the big cats are rescues this is the best life they could hope to have since they were born in captivity and would never survive in the wild
i just love getting a raspberry from such a gorgeous animal the majesty of the tiger is unequaled it‚Äôs a shame she‚Äôs doing a life sentence instead of being in her natural environment
baby sloth sound like a kitten mixed with a human baby
didn t know they moved that fast when they re young love the moooom mooooooom maaaaaaahmmmm so cute
where are you i want to come and give them a little kiss i don t care where in the world you are i will fly swim drive anything i just want to give them a kiss
they sound like their constantly falling my god it s cause they do constantly fall
that doesn t sound like gering ding ding ding ding ding ding
op do you own the rights to this video if is we really need to talk
how do they not get headaches seeing upside down for that long that s what i wanna know
is it just me or do they move a lot faster as babies compared to full grown ones
i didnt know they made noises i cant handle myself i am full of joy
i am an absolute sloth lover they are the cutest animal as a baby üòçüòòüòçüòò
sadly these are all orphaned sloths and they re calling for their mothers
could you train a sloth to keep up that level of activity
this subreddit is supposed to be for media that makes me go aww not the other way around
that first one sounds like a yelling jerry seinfeld
ok i m years old former military man and i have just been undone by the cuteness
just from watching this i feel all the blood rushing to my head like i am actually upside down
oh i though that was the sound of me going through life
haha d i spent good time thinking sloths couple days ago like how did animal like that evolve this far they are so slow i needed this d
do they move faster while they re babies i saw a video of an adult on the other day and it was moving around much slower than these guys
this is them before they grown into the freaky demons that adult sloths are something about sloths terrify me i m just glad they cant move fast
sounds like you are asking a question about their opinion and every answer is ehh ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
showed my wife this and she started crying happy tears will be saving this video to show her the next time she feels down
my cat heard baby sloth and came running as though her tail was on fire too cute peace
how the fuck do i adopt like of them and make them my family
it sounds like the noise someone makes when they almost fall over but recover
for my birthday my family took me to see meet a baby sloth alas the place was packed and i was about families back in line when they announced that they were gonna give the sloth a break rest slew of disappointed groans n sighs from the rest of the line so my family starts exclaimed about the near two hour drive and it being a birthday thing so i get pulled up just as the wee thing woke up to get to be the last one to get a face to face photo op dude with sloth turns to my kids and asks who s the birthday boy i m like birthday girl me i m best part apparently this particular sloth had some sort of older bald crippled broad thing you re not allowed to touch them but he was doing his damnedest to touch me dude kept having to pull away lol i about fainted from the cute
just told my husband we need a sloth support animal
slave i m back treat my war scars gimme food and i ll let you pet me for a bit before i go get my revenge
‚Äúwhere you been for months cat ‚Äù ‚Äúfucking and fighting ‚Äù
your cat has seen some things during those three months
owner i missed you so much mr fuzzy wuzzy face did you miss mommy mommy missed you yes she did my precious little man i‚Äôll go get your sweater cat turns to camera now i remember why i left
he probably cam across a gang of ally cats and they sharpened his claws to get him to kill some rival gang cat which he then backed out of and spent half a month trying to dull his claws down amp x b i love thinking of crazy things that will never happen
my big boy cat just walked in after months it was so surreal
he was on a vision quest sometimes they ll fuck you up
i m so glad he came home my friend s cat is missing right now and she s all but given up hope and it s completely heartbroken and this gives me hope little snirdle is still out there
he heard grumpy cat died and he s ready for his audition op better get your traveling shoes on
my mom had a cat that was gone for at least months she was older and my mom looked for her and we thought she may have went off to die then one day my parents were leaving and out of the woods she came and ran across the field to them she was thin and very tired traveled miles but she lived for at least more years and didn‚Äôt travel to far down the driveway after that
did a double take if his ear had been knoched i would have sworn it was my old cat wubi he was a feral barn cat that loved me and became my indoor shadow very happily one winter he used to sleep with me like that too i miss him so much this picture made me smile to remember
anyone else guilty of when they see cat paws vurled like that they mess with them saying bunny bunny bunny
i m always tempted to rub paws they are so cute and soft
it s good to know that it isn t just my cats that want to be the little spoon
those little paws are killing me so soft and velvety my kitties hate it when i want to hold their front paws it s fine when they want to grab a hold of any part of me with those paws plus claws d back feet are another story most of my kitties like foot massages
he likes it when you hold his hand when he s sleeping the angel
you took the picture and closed your eyes like you were sleeping
i love when my kitty does this i call it bunny paws
if you don t at some point call them butterbean i will be thoroughly disappointed p s butter is adorable
my heart melted like butter it‚Äôs so sweet ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è die of cuteness overload
wow this photo for real took my breath away you guys look amazing
highly doubt the person posting it is in this photo
the last times i saw it they mentioned which nations they we re i think one was mandan but can t remember the others
wait why is this on aww though i mean its a nice picture but cmon reminds me of when the fat interracial couple posted them gettin engaged a few months back
cool i guess but i wouldn t call it cute or aww material
nice title asshole some people are native and proud of it
what is the meaning behind that type of headdress anyone know
coop has some serious tail on him by the looks of it too no love for the bushiness
hate to say it but you re about to catch some heckin trouble for your math there
now that is a good doggo what is this doggo some sort of german shepard something
oh man was he named after the fox and the hound movie
i could be mistaken but it looks like he has some shaved fur on his back leg is he doing alright he looks like a wonderful buddy to have around
never thought i d be a sucker for rats cutest thing i ve seen lately
which one is the medicine love or one in the spoon only if children were more like this sweeter
son of a bitch that rat smiles when he kissed his itty bitty head i wish anyone loved me this much
the look on her face when he kisses her i‚Äôm in love
what s the point of medicating an animal that lives for like years
she closes her eyes and leans into the kiss i remember the good ol days when someone would give me kisses
a buddy of mine in college had a pet rat i loved going over there that little guy was rambunctious as hell but he loved human attention that little fat rat was awesome
rat ooooo this is pretty good die k√ºss rat yiiiiis that s the good stuff
th way it pushes its head back into the first smooch
after watching rat traps videos on youtube it feels really weird seeing this
i have had three pet rats in the past they make wonderful pets i had them trained where i could let them loose in a room and would come when i called their name they all died from cancer unfortunately they have a short life
i used to have of them they‚Äôre adorable but their lives are so short
rats have the cutest faces but if one came up on me i would flip my shit it s a love hate relationship
my favorite pets were my sweet ratties merry and pippin
holy hell how it closes it s eyes when it gets kissed so friggen adorable
rats really are amazing little pets so affectionate and loving intelligent as all hell and such mischievous little personalities loyal as any dog but also as independent as a cat they love to be with you but they re happy to just chill out with you rather than always needing to be fussed i kept them for years and honestly loved every one heartbreaking to lose them though
i used to rub my rat s head and she would be like stahp no no staahhhp awwwwww yusssssssssss
i need someone to kiss my head like this guy kisses his pet rat
the little expression on her cute little face is too endearing i m dying i can t handle this
please tell me his name is remy live action ratatouille movie to come
damn fine you have a pet rat but kissing it that s brave
do regular veterinarians tend to rats i want one but want to make sure it gets health checks especially for end of life care thanks
after playing the plague tale i m not sure if i like rats anymore
what is it with people kissing their pets and sometimes even french kissing them with full tongue action the fuck is that
anyone else look at this and see remy from ratatouille it‚Äôs almost too adorable
more people should try having some pet rats they make great pets and are really easy to look after most of the time just make sure you don t get a single rat they don t do well by them self s
pet rat takes her medicine simply put lab rat doing it s job
rats are so underated the best small animal for kids i think they re clean l and don t bite like hamsters unless it was raised poorly plus way smarter than guinea pigs or hamsters but they don t live long üò≠
i love this so fucking much i don‚Äôt have my ratties anymore but i loved them so much the silly little things
i m normally not too fond of rats but i ll be darned if that isn t cute af
fuck me i‚Äôve never wanted to get tats more than now and i‚Äôve always wanted to get rats
ok i don t like rodents but damn it if that aint the cutest fucking thing i ve seen thus far today
imagine measuring out your medicine and it s the size of your face
i adore them i had one who looked almost exactly like this she was sweet affectionate and loved tickles but they have such a short life i can‚Äôt take the heartbreak
pet rats are one of the coolest pets so smart easy to train and mine loved to be held
to everyone considering buying a rat after seeing this clip dont do it they are loud at nights and spread a disgusting scent into the room
i have a phobia of rats but this video has made me rethink that a little bit
she looks so sweet i think he is very hungry she should have had some food before medicine
das the cutest thing i‚Äôve ever seen what‚Äôs the medicine for
aweee i miss having rats but i have dogs and a bunny now
imagining a blue whale doing something similar to a human
i had a pet rat when i was younger sweetest creature i‚Äôve ever known
guess we re just gonna forget about that whole plague incident like nothing happened
oh my goodness what a cutie makes me miss my rats so much
i take icky medicine and human will love me i love my human give me kissus am happy squeaker
why does the rat look like a teenager when their mom kisses him i love everything about this
and then rat man sent her to free ant man from the quantum realm
ah so remy was on adderall this whole time i knew there was something off about a rat who could cook french cuisine
she even lifts her wee head up to get a kiss i love it so much
meanwhile i need to pin mine down and stuff a syringe in her mouth
sure they re all cute and fun until they die on you after a few years
she s adorable awww people give rats a bad wrap when they re such cuties
rats can be cute but it s disturbing to know if you died with it loose it would start eating you after only a day or two
you might have totally changed my opinion on rats with this single video
is this real cuz i m getting a real strong ratatouille vibe
rats are wonderful very smart lovely pets their year lifespan is very sad though
i think about this every time i give my rat her medicine she s not nearly no neat about she sticks both feet and her entire face in it
you can tell she is very happy just look at that tail
my partner and i have two that loves those and chases them
i love a cat‚Äôs pleased little trot when returning with a fetched item
i would love to see a video of that if you ever get a chance op
she s thinking why do you keep throwing that away after all the effort i put into getting it for you but because i m a good girl i will get it for you forever
my beetlejuice solid black also does this too he brings me ‚Äúsprings‚Äù that i found at the pet store and demands i throw them for him i didn‚Äôt teach him he taught me how sweet i‚Äôve never met another cat that fetches let alone one that looks just like him i will have to get some video to share thank you for sharing your kitty is beautiful and thank you for getting a black kitty in the us anyway black cats and dogs are still adopted at lower rates due to misconceptions and prejudices and superstitions source volunteer at shelters vet tech
would you mind linking the balls you use my little black guy loves chasing the little crinkly toys and walking around with them in his mouth he‚Äôd probably like these too
i got a good girl that fetches as well silly cats thinks she s a pupper
cute we have all black kitty that looks just like her and she also plays fetch she loves the little craft puffballs
my dumbass thought the cat was holding a sword with its tail
i have an all black cat and she plays fetch around the house all the time she‚Äôll bring me a toy or hair tie and will meow until i throw it
your cat reminds me of the angery as fuk meme template
that happy little tail just warms my heart so much i could cry
that s an awesome photo ive tried to get a photo of my cat playing fetch best i could get is a bad grainy video mine plays fetch with the tiny bells that come on cheap chinese cat toys when i inevitably step on and break them
did she always want to play fetch or did you teach her
if you pet her real nicely and give her treats she can lead you to a pot of gold
looks like she should be sitting on a mountain top dispensing wisdom
i‚Äôve literally never seen this picture before not once never ever
this seems to be a long lost character from thunder cats
rear sighting of a cat evolving into it s final form
til rats can jump alarmingly fast and far thanks thanks for this
i love how the rat winds up before he catapults across room
cat ‚Äúi could do that i just don‚Äôt want to ‚Äù falls off couch rolling over
rats are wonderful pets for children they are gentle intelligent easy and inexpensive to look after and they live just long enough to instill responsibility and provide lessons on emotion and loss
now that you know how far they can jump keep it in mind next time you re retracing your father s steps in venice exploring the tomb of sir richard
i say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit it s the only way to be sure
is it really an impossible jump if it‚Äôs a rat from the same planet as superman if anything it‚Äôs a shitty jump
i thought this was going to be a gif of a rat endlessly getting ready to jump
what kind of rat is this seems much bigger than other pet rats i ve seen
i had a pet rat once and he would like to curl up on my shoulder and sleep id forget he was even there one day i was doing the dishes and dolf was asleep on my left shoulder a girl i knew came in and was talking to me she was on my left i guess dolf woke up and he came round my neck the girl didnt know i had a rat she screamed and ran out the house and dolf shat on my shoulder in fright
he s calculating the math needed to make the jump rats are smart buggers
my first ever pet was a rat when i was his name was ernie one day i was sitting on my bed playing with ernie and my mom suddenly opened the door and walked in it must have surprised him because he leaped across the room to his cage my mom freaked out at me because she thought i had thrown him but i insisted he had jumped i feel so vindicated watching this video
my rats used to be able to jump pretty good distances like that great pets by the way
not really impossible is it now let‚Äôs talk about that name kryptonian is this rat the secret to superman‚Äòs weakness
after playing plague tale i impulsively started searching for torch
it‚Äôs very cute that pet rats can jump like that but if a wild rat would pull one of those on me i‚Äôd lose it completely
could you imagine if humans could jump ft forward that seems about proportional to how far that rat jumps compared to its body length
impressive ratty my boys never make it when they try things like that they end up on the floor looking at me like what happened üòÇ
i remember my brother running in the house and yelling you didn t tell me rats can jump he had gone to the wood pile to feed the stove and i told him before he left to be on the watch for templeton a wood rat who decided to live in the wood pile he met him
one small step for man but one giant leap for rat kind
yeah no thanks that s what i saw in my garage when i took out the garbage at midnight except it wasn t my pet
mildly phobic of rats while also acknowledging what cool critters they are this is the scariest fucking thing i‚Äôve seen in reddit
i know this is supposed to be cute but i may have nightmares tonight
just before launch his little whiskers twitch so cute
i blinked and i missed it the first time i had to rewatch
for how much this guy hyped up the jump it actually looked downright easy
not impossible rats ate crazy fast and jump power is high too they also have no fear i have no issue with domestic rats but wild ones i do
no wonder kryptonite is so effective it comes from these supernaturals
impossible jump my ass it went beyond of what the kid signaled it to jump to
hmm yes that s a nice rat jump i m way more impressed by the girl not flinching at all though
if a rat that size jumped on me like that id be dead
picture taken with potato this is an older picture her juvenile marking have since disappeared her hate however remains
she looks like a fish version of the ‚Äúno take only throw‚Äù dog
oh my gosh adorable does he actually look like that i want one
come on op you really didn‚Äôt think to say ‚Äúpupsicle‚Äù
awe he‚Äôs running to his safe spot to eat his popsicle üòç super cute
it‚Äôs a double popsicle omg is he coming to share on with me ahhhhhhhhhh i love it
somewhere behind that puppy a little girl is crying
y all know that s a squeaky toy right just checking
is that a spider on her chin and i m also mesmerized by her sauron eyes
it‚Äôs my favourite picture of your cat too but i‚Äôve got no others to compare it to so
your cat is extraordinary he can touch his nose with his tongue
that s great but the whole time i was thinking this is gonna end badly like a very mild nononoyes
this might actually be the most wholesome thing i ve seen in years xd
you re going to be a daddy hooray now get the fuck on the ground stop resisting
this is fantastic took me a bit to figure out what was happening
this seems like a pretty fucked up way to let them know to be honest
this made me cry holy shit white cops being sweet to a big black man i m wiping away tears maybe there s hope for us after all
wow police pull a black man over to tell him good news this is wholesome af
i thought the gf must be white to pull some dumb shit like this but no it d take a very long time to forgive her for that
police departments have decided that these kinds of videos are good pr they aren t every interaction between police and unwitting citizens who have done nothing wrong is stressful and potentially dangerous stop it
just like in the parade how h mans look into the camera
they are soooooo fluffy too bad they are such jerks
could you pet an alpaca in a scenario like this or if you held out a hand to sniff would they goober you
i love how they look at the camera when walking i like this a lot
they seem so curious üíñ i say they are definitely dr seuss animals
put a cupcake in my hand and this would be my dream day ‚ù§Ô∏èü¶ôüßÅ
why is getting meaningless internet points that important to you
blue lives dont matter and police dogs are treated horribly stop licking boots and stop posting this shit
actually a full size german shepard he s undercover
r to dispatch i ll be out at the station for the rest of the day drowning in cuteness no status or backup
awwww he s going to grow up and be used to harass minorities and poor people how cute üòä
it s literally the third time i see the exact same photo
hasn t aged a day but he ll be ripping arms and nuts as soon as he does
it s already been hours and it s still not locked guys you re all slacking
ah shit here we go again who did the police fuck up this time
awww look at his little ears unsure about what s gonna happen
aww he looks just like my sable when he was a puppy
hahaha this dog is being trained to bite black people bur look how cute he is
don t let this distract you from the fact that the mods of this sub actually defended a picture of a guy nearly killing his cat once and acted like it was no big deal they couldn t give a fuck about animals but hey a cute dog right yeah keep looking at the dog
ugh they‚Äôre cute but there‚Äôs way too many problems with police dogs can we please just ban them from the sub
i wonder what all these removed posts could have been about
i normally downvote these reposts but op s honesty has netted him an upvote
always funny to read all these comments of people hating cops but the moment something bad happens they will be the first to ring them amp x b just enjoy the picture stop trying to force your political agenda through everyones throats
man too much bitching about police in this thread we should probably not allow k unit dogs because of how riled up it gets the sjw crowd in the comments
here he s again that s astonishing it s absolutely world class he has taken them apart only football dogs can make you feel like this
something is off about this comment section not sure what
what unarmed civilians did the cops murder this time
where did a cop do something horrible on video yesterday
so if anyone is wondering this time she was pregnant
after reading threads on here about people giving bleach to their kids people they care for and the backwards lawmaking in the states on abortion this repost is a welcome reprieve c mon that pup is adorable
it‚Äôs a shame this dog will be used to undermine people‚Äôs civil rights the entire purpose for police k ‚Äôs is to bring them out whenever a citizen refuses to give consent to an unjustifiable search the dog comes to your car and gives the signal when the officer gives a verbal command it‚Äôs a tactic that allows an officer to search whoever they want without cause if they bring a k to sniff your car they‚Äôre going to search it
so a repost that s even completely honest about being a repost still gets k upvotes are you people deranged
what s his name if i were to guess scout parker cooper
lol all these police brutality posters probably weight pounds and absolutely cower every time they see a cop
cute dog too bad there is a total piece of shit in the photo with him
here he is again that s astonishing absolutely world class
you people talk about the police like they are some sort of evil machine no they are people people are not perfect and make mistakes also most people wouldn t dream of making the sacrifices most of these guys make jesus also yes this is a repost
upvoting this photo for the first time because at least you were honest in the title
take your copaganda and shove it firmly up your thin blue line who got killed today by blue isis in order for this to show up again let s take this innocent animal and train it to do our bidding go fuck yourself and every fucking one of your gang
this is the rcmp canadian police not sure why everyone here assumes that every cop is a fucked up american cop
all these comments are gonna be fuckin dust in the wind tomorrow anyways acab
i love posts like these because they make the anti cop crowd on reddit which is most of reddit so triggered
yall can stop crying whether you like it or not society needs police officers even if they do shit things sometimes
lovely dog would hate to get bit by him later on in life running from the cops wait i dont do that
we need an update on this doggo he‚Äôs probably sniffing out bad guys right now
i really don t mind seeing this photo over and over again it s really adorable
poor dog looks scared i d be scared too hanging around a bunch of murdering pricks
jesus fucking christ this subreddit is such a shitshow now everything must be political and is clearly the dog s fault give it a rest
oh look cops did something illegal and fucked someone over again didn‚Äôt they
someone get that filthy wrectched thing away from that good lil puppy
sending chubbies some head rubs he is a beautiful boy
he is one regal looking cat do you mind sharing how you came by such a unique cross
are you kidding me with this guy he s a beauty and his name cracks me up
great story sounds like it worked out best for everyone
now i know what you re thinking aww how cute i want a bunny don t just don t
haha my dog does the same thing when i‚Äôm trying to shovel snow
the outdoor pen is a great idea but depending on where you live it needs a top hawks and other birds of prey racoons and even some dogs and cats will not hesitate to get in there and it only takes them a second another thing to look out for when having your house bun or any bun outside is to watch what they eat many parks and even other peoples yards are full of pesticides or bad things for a bun to nibble this is an adorable video though and good for you
we re like aww playtime cagefighter bunny you throwing leaves at me are you throwing leaves at me it s go time
i feel happy watching this thank you humans and bunny
ummm so isn t there probably a lot of bunny poop in that pen that he s digging around in with his bare hands
i‚Äôve had rabbits before like of what he was throwing was little poos
imagine if a trex was actually a giant bunny the dinosaur ages dont seem so terrifying now
i‚Äôm sure he has a holy hand grenade in his back pocket in case the mood turns
i really love this if i would hold mine outside he would do this as well
sitting in the bathroom at work didnt realize there was sound the wife laughing scared the shit outta me lol
little guy was having a blast animals playing are the best
im so glad i found reddit first i hated it now its my substitute to youtube its so much better
i have met the bunny whisperer and i am now complete
can confirm that they love this grew up raising chickens and new zealand rabbits and the rabbits would do the same thing with hay
when my mom s bunny was being given a special treat a carrot red clover pig ears the leaves form i think a form of plantain but i m not sure he would get up on his hind legs and pivot so that he never took his eyes and nose off it so i often used to stand and wave it left and right watching him follow it while saying dance bunny dance also since a rabbit s claws don t dig in on a linoleum floor i often used to put one hand on his shoulder and the other on his opposite hip and spin him around a few times my mom would always express annoyance e when i did either one
my dog used to love this i had no idea bunnies would too
lol my fat ass bunny will watch me like are you done üòÇ
i hope you don t keep it there unattended easy for hawks to swoop down and grab also coyotes
dude wha stop why are you throwing my bed around i just cleaned stop rude
how to play with bunny kill skin clean butcher season to taste cook in cast iron over open flame play time is the best
whatever you do don t climb in there and start kicking leaves around you ll gain points from the field goal but lose a bunny in the process
the look of disappointment on the bunny‚Äôs face when it‚Äôs over
would a bunny and a sweet old grandpa cat get along i wonder
oh man i miss my bun so much this bunny looks like the sweetest girl
i loved having a house rabbit she was trained to only poo in her little home thing anyway i fell asleep drunk one night and when i woke up she had chewed half of my fringe off
she s gonna tunnel under that and or jump over it unless that chicken wire is buried and there isn t a top to that pen also looking like a drive through for birds of prey source owned bunnies
i ve seen too many videos of people with their small pets outside enjoying themselves until a bird swoops in out of nowhere and takes off with it
if it s only of an octagon is it still called cage fighting
rabbits are incredibly social animals you should have at least two
get a leaf blower and change out the motor for a lower watt blower motor they are really cheap at places like grainger get a really low non threatening air flow going on and really get that bunny playing
this is the most wholesome thing i have seen in my entire life
i knew it was going to be this before i clicked reddit where everything gets reposted seven hundred thousand times tm
i wish my bunny were a fraction this smart i need to bribe him with half a gallon of yogurt to get him out of his cage
the bunny lowkey looks like it s fur is hexagon patterned cuz of the cage
this never gets old seen this so many times over the years and it always makes me smile
ugh buns are so so cute and i would love to have some but i know how intensive their care is and recognize that i m not able to provide it so i ll just keep watching cute bun gifs to make up for it w
our bunny used to garden with us she‚Äôd bring us all the dead leaves she‚Äôd lick us like a dog she never left the yard except to go to the neighbors where my daughter took piano lessons we miss you sunshine
i love bunnies so much most of them are just so playful
the rabbit is like stop fucking around and throw the goddamn leaves roy
alright reddit what deadly disease is creating by this adorable behavior
this seriously made my last hour way better keeps me distracted from the th wheeling
so what‚Äôs that pen made of is that where she stays mostly it looks like plexiglass asking cos my son wants to get a bunny
its all good until you pick up the pile where the bunny pooped
this has been reposted a x‚Äôs and i hope it gets reposted more times it never gets old
that s adorable quick someone explain how that bunny actually feels threatened and thinks its fighting for its life liable to have a heart attack any second from the sheer terror or something
this the first time i saw a bunny play with a human i never knew they did this
that‚Äôs freakin adorable when it goes up on its back legs like that
you re real tough outside this cage i dare you to get in here with me bro
imagine someone coming in to your house and throwing all you shit every where i d be doing chuck norris flying kicks as well
oh ffs here i was thinking i hit the happiness ceiling in life and you go ahead and post shit like this
i strongly suggest the person throwing the leaves to use his legs instead of his back when grabbing things from the floor in general years of lifting wrong while working retail has killed my back and i havent even finished uni yet
my cat keeps killing wild rabbits and she wants nothing more than to go outside and run around the forest what should i do i‚Äôve had her years since she was a sick tiny kitty i can‚Äôt give her up but i feel it is cruel to leave her in my house she practically yells if i don‚Äôt let her out she is miserable in the winter
bunnicula has diarrheah from time to time blackberrie leaves are the cure she loves them i used to let her csge free for plus years after a shit storm i had to put her in the pen itentiary shes minimum security but i think she likes habing her own space
my back hurts just thinking about playing with the bunny
food is contained also tuckered out by the time you arrive nice view from the top of cage highly recommend ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è
just put a cat in the same cage he ll have more fun
it makes me tear up good job parents for raising your kids right
this warms my heart so much my faith in humanity is slowly being restored
this is how our society should behave great job to these workers taking the time out to be caring i hope their bosses take note af their diligence
i remember when this first came out and it make me so happy that someone so young was willing to help a person in need and not care who saw her or anything this gave me hope in humanity again
at least there‚Äôs a small glimmer of hope in this world thank you kind strangers
this is fantastic absolutely props to the worker however i can t help but think it s sad that because we live in such a egocentric society this is seen as such a beautiful and out of the ordinary gesture this is how everyone should behave helping those who need help without making a big deal out of it and not acting like the person in need is a lesser human this worker is an amazing example of how all humans should act
for some reason i was more focused on miss i m going to move your cup over there
that well to what herself will don t even take to required on woman the of job is lovely
a lot of disabled people find this kind of thing super offensive eating while disabled should not be considered ‚Äòaww‚Äô they are still people not pets
and here i gotten written up yesterday for being outgoing and not rude to patrons smh this gives me hope
this looks older managers in today‚Äôs retail world would say ‚Äúget back to work i don‚Äôt have hours to give‚Äù
brazil can be kind too it seems also that‚Äôs not mcdonald‚Äôs as some seem to think it‚Äôs a ‚Äúreal food‚Äù chain called giraffas
love is the only currency that should increase in value
god bless people like this they really are the best humanity has
offensive to some snowflakes this ain t no fast food
omg this is so nice this person go to heaven certain that
if only we had more people like this in the world instead we have people making fun of them because they are disabled
is there any way we can help her and him perhaps financially someone should start a gofundme or something
it s weird but all this does is make me mad at mcdonalds
god damn it i m trying not to tear up fair play on those workers
this melted my heart such a kind person her parents have raised her right she deserves a raise period
instantly love these people i have an overly active justice meter and when people help those who can‚Äôt help themselves i lose it what an amazing person
this is awesome without a doubt but the fact we film these kinds of things really worries me sometimes to make people with disabilities feel different is one of the worst things we can do
customer service can be a pretty thankless job but sometimes you get to help people and that s nice
i m torn seeing these types of videos on one side it s great that someone can be compassionate enough to help a stranger but on the other why would you film it it seems like a private moment if anyone would film me doing something similar i would feel extremely uncomfortable
not all heroes are like your stereotypical ones some get payed minimum wage and wear a fast food place uniform but their kind hearts take them places where others don t
my satisfaction is immeasurable and my day is saved
this makes me extremely happy we all need some help
i hope they got a bonus for this even if it isn t about the money
just good humanity we all have but usually lack showing it
how come they don t say nothing to him about coke in the water cup
this is staged people totally fucked up that people do this for internet points
thank you for sharing and thank you to the individuals who helped him with his food this goes to say that kindness manifests itself in all shapes and forms and that it only takes a couple of minutes out of anyones day to make a difference if only those around us could be touched enough to replicate that behaviour and compassion and kindness i think then it would be a greater world for future generations to live in
genuine question what does he do if he doesn‚Äôt have someone willing to spoon feed him shouldn‚Äôt he have a caregiver with him also who is recording
if i was their boss i‚Äôd give them a huge fucking bonus we need to promote kindness generosity and altruistic behaviors sometimes i can‚Äôt believe we live in a world where a family who are not good at anything other than being famous acquires such tremendous wealth while the backbone and foundation of our society nurses teachers etc put themselves in debt and years of schooling only to make a salary that will barely provide end rant
if i saw that god knows i d tip her all the money in my wallet
we need more people like this young woman here in the world
bet she got fired for not being at the till hahahahahaha ha ha ha cries in the corner
now tell me this is the other worker recording this to get famous or the guys friend
i work with the disabled and i wish more people in the community we re like this even if the manager made her good for them and she learns somthing from it not assuming it s not her idea just throwing the possibility out there
her boss better realize what a great employee he has
and yet this employee won t get recognized by managers
why doesnt this guy have a caregiver with him if he cant feed himself
not the hero we need the hero we deserve right in the gd feels
i wish myself and everyone else in the world could be more like these ladies brought a tear to my eye üëçüôÇ
seriously this makes me so incredibly sad noone deserves such a fate sometimes life is just to cruel to people and to all of us living beings im asking whats the point of all that is that really neccesary why cant living be a nice experience why is such shit allowed to happen all that stuff makes me doubt my believe in god
you have no idea how much i love ve it when people do this it warms my heart and makes my day the world needs more love and kindness like this
i mean if he‚Äôs this severely disabled that he can‚Äôt feed himself shouldn‚Äôt he have a caregiver while out
is this a corporate video demonstrating inappropriate uses if paid resources
great video but this isn t really the right sub are people really saying or thinking aww when they see someone helping a disabled person and if they are they shouldn t be
seeing these kind of things in our rotten world it s quite valuable
this is my favourite video on the internet i know it‚Äôs an old replay but this woman deserves a wholesome thank you
so many people seem to think employee is her is it tho i m positive u can see adam s apple and overall more male characteristics
that‚Äôs what i call above and beyond customer service
i ll say it yet again tired of people recording disabled people for internet clicks
i‚Äôm so glad they‚Äôre people like this makes me so happy
i hope i am a good enough parent to raise either of my children to be that kind to others
i need to see more heartwarming stuff like this i‚Äôve known plenty of disabled people and it seems most all of them have never known anything outside of cruelty and scorn
but i bet she barely makes ends meet on that minimum wage they have her on shame on this society what a brilliant kind person
posting this here is patronizing as fuck lmao it‚Äôs a person not a puppy fuck you all
a quick reminder for everyone if you ever witness something like this you need to make sure you note who the employee was and pass it on to their corporate office manager tell them how impressed you were and that they have gained a customer for life due to this action even if it is mcdonalds hell even a yelp review naming the employee would be beneficial recognition even when the action should be the standard reinforces the motivation and hopefully perpetuates it‚Äôs replication
it‚Äôs almost as if fast food workers are people with the capacity for human empathy and compassion and not automatons to be demonized and ridiculed for their ‚Äúlack of skills‚Äù
aita if i would not do this if i was a fast food worker
there is so much good in the world and i‚Äôm so glad i got to see this piece of it
but before i help you do you mind if i film this for the internet thanks
please don‚Äôt downvote but it‚Äôs more than likely the man is related to an employee on their lunch break than any manager letting an employee get paid to do this
small act of kindness that makes the biggest difference
they arent getting paid nearly enough to do this yet they still do
i work at mcd‚Äôs for years and every sunday there was a blind man who came in and always asked for my help with ordering taking a seat it was so great to build that relationship especially in a fast food job
this worker deserves a raise great man he is doing a good work i like so much to this peoples
filming this and putting it online makes you an asshole show some respect
my question is how did he get there and why is he not with anyone if he cant feed himself why is he alone
why does this make me so sad it s a beautiful thing and such a kind thing for someone to do but it makes me feel incredibly sad watching this i couldn t watch it again
wish people wouldn t record this stuff so disrespectful
although it s often hard to see it there are still good people in this world
because yea they all do this kind of shit hahaahahahaa downvotes
if we care for everyone the world would be a better place
this is very kind but it also makes me wonder if the kindness is only for the camera i don t mean to discredit any kindness but there really is no way of knowing if this is just for the camera why record it inspiration or praise
sometimes brazil isn‚Äôt such a shit place to live in
but who s helping her often the kindest people are the one with nothing
it makes me sad to know that this guy was alone in the restaurant all by himself this girl deserves all the recognition and i hope this inspires others to be like her
i love this so much it‚Äôs honestly inspiring what an act of kindness
can we tell what fast food place this is it doesn t look like a mcdonalds or anything immediately recognizable to this east coaster
i‚Äôm so glad to see this sometimes i feel like there is not kindness left in the world and all i can do to survive is become cold and detached myself
i know a lot of fast food joints would have managers who would berate or write up an employee for doing this this is a good kid i m sure the guy can eat on his own but that kid turned a long ordeal into a quicker pleasant interaction
she‚Äôd be great in health care and probably many other fields that need large amounts of patience and compassion i wonder if she‚Äôs currently in school
reminds of when an elderly customer with balance issues fell on his way to our bathroom and my manager very politely and kindly asked if he needed assistance in the restroom bro held up this tiny old man so he could pee then helped him back out to his van where his daughter was waiting
surprised a company wouldn t have policies forbidding this because of liability i tend to think most people are good but stuff like fear of liability gets in the way more often than not
this is so fucking cool it feels nice to know humans have this kind of capacity to care for one another
holy shit my faith in humanity is restored if only for an instant
aww isn t this disabled person just so cuuute ¬°¬° poor guy d d
selfless people like her are what we need more of kindness and compassion go a long way this was beautiful
see how mcdonald‚Äôs employees are more educated and kind than anyone on the republican party
this is what i need to see after scrolling though the news section üôÇ
we need more people like this i hope you all have the best day
things like these make me believe in humanity again
that‚Äôs a very whole something to do what‚Äôs the backstory
good job actually great job we need more people like this in society salute
humanity restored i too am disabled but with duchenne muscular dystrophy and seeing this kind of gesture is uplifting
i ve done this once before and it s a very enlightening experience
a lot of people complain about retail jobs or food service where employees have to deal with customers but in reality these employees are engaging with every single sort of person and it can really educate a person in empathy on so many different levels obviously there will always be shitty people coming in but there are so many kind people one can meet both who work there and stop in
that‚Äôs in brasil not everyone is an off duty cop here üòÅ
humanity we can nail innocents to crosses we can help those in need choice wisely who you wish to be
stop infantilizing the disabled this isn‚Äôt adorable this is someone being a decent human being
i hate seeing how good people do this type of good deed and not get paid enough this particular worker needs a raise i can tell since fast food never pays enough and overworks they re staff it s not just fast food it s all sorts of jobs that help people teachers mental health doctors counselors there s an incredibly long list and it s appalling
true its never too late to change but some people are too lazy to even care about them self s including me sounds bad yes but do most of us people who complain about wanting to change do anything about changing them self s no and that s that
does anyone know her social media someone should really thank this beautiful human being for being so kind
but when i do that i get arrested and called sick by the parents such double standards gosh
anyone know this person s name so proper accolades can be given
you re posting a disabled guy in the same sub where you usually post animals do you realize that and for what to go awww on his weakness to get a rush at the sight of innocence direct that pity to the mirrors you spiritual animals fucked up
thank you for reminding me that there are still beautiful people out there
i know that guy he isn t disabled that s just a tactic he uses to pick up chicks
hell yes moments like this are what let s me continue to have faith in humanity
why does a disabled person have to be fed by a fast food worker is the real question totally normal country
plot twist he s not really disabled and he just got a girl to literally spoon feed him
puta que pariu lindo demais saber que isso √© no brasil
she better have got a raise don‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs a part time job
meanwhile some asshole is just sitting there filming it
this warms my heart to see with all the negative going on in this world it‚Äôs great to see these workers helping others with such positivity thank you
religion and all that shit doesnt come to mind when i see something like this i just think damn this girl is way more attractive than of the women clinging on to ig likes if i was a single man this is the type of woman i d be trying to chase
we need this to be spread across the internet widely as this person works a shit job and probably wont be recognized for it and deserves to
my mom is disabled and it kills me when people look at her like she s a monster i am so glad there are kind people like this who will help instead of stare
gosh this is so so sweet can‚Äôt help but tear up at this a little
to me this is being a good person and then killing some time from your actual duties win win
this gives me hope that there are good people in this world my eyes started leaking liquid for some reason
although it is nice this doesn t really belong here
little acts of kindness can go a long way the worker made that persons day a little easier and also made my day a lot brighter puts a big smile on your face knowing their as still kind people out there that like to and want to help
i don t see a fastfood worker i see a health support person doing her lifes work
is our world that fucked up that shit like this makes the front page i mean this is just normal shit no you see a disabled person that can t eat without help and you fucking help them that s how the world works
not gonna lie my eyes filled up a little i fucking love you all you wonderful human beings
finally today some fckn good news makes my day when i see this üòá
let‚Äôs be real this guy wants her number for sure i‚Äôm sure he can feed himself but it is so nice to get a pretty lady to do it for you i love this this guy is a genius
why do people feel the need to record stuff like this do they think it feels good for the guy with the disability to be recorded and put all over the internet pisses me off
holy shit this made me cry thank you for helping him
some people will always need help that doesn t mean they re not worth helping meera reed
now i ve seen it all a sub about cute pets fetishizing disability under the guise of cuteness thanks reddit
they probably fired her sadly for wasting company time
meanwhile i wait in at the counter for minutes since wendy‚Äôs only has one fucking employee on front counter
all it takes is one act of kindness to make someone else s day aittle brighter those momenets are often far and few in between sadly enough but when it does happen it can be a magical experience we need more people like this
i know i m gonna be that guy i m sorry but let s use people first language he s not a disabled person he s a person with a disability if we want to get super pc we could say he s a person with an exceptionality fantastic video nonetheless
this made my heart melt we need more people like this
how about we do nice things for people without putting them on display for the whole world to see
we have to congratulate everyone who take their time to do things like that but i d love to live in a planet we shouldn t to that s humanity small kids do it before they grow old enough to have prejudices and skepticism we have to function as small kids when it comes to selfless love for our peers wish i could be like that too
it s a shame that these aren t the type of people our culture props up and gives adoration to
the world would be a better place with more people like that
stop posting us to subs you post puppies and babies to we get it you think we aren t real people stop rubbing it in
who is the asshole recording this seriously why can t you just let the poor guy eat in peace do you really think that he enjoys being recorded because his is special needs fuck you op btw on a side note the guy probably asked for help and they really can t refuse him
everytime i see a video like this nowadays the person featured has a gofundme set up in their name and they become a hundred thousandaire maybe she ll be as lucky
thank you for making me believe there is still hope in humanity
i see acts of kindness like this and it gives me hope for humanity
"hope her parents see this
honestly one of the nicest things i ve see"
people think their time is too valuable sometimes spending some time to help someone is the most valuable thing you can do with it
when i worked for dunkin i had a customer with some type of mental disorder but he always came in with a smile he would look at me and i know you and a big ol hey buddy and a high five
why did this make me want to cry god i need to see more happy things like this
at a taco bell near me the workers take turns giving up their free lunch to feed a disabled and homeless man he comes by everyday and eats a free meal pretty awesome watching the workers deal with him because he can be loud and will cut in front of you he is clearly disabled and they handle him really well
proud of you who ever you are there are good people
i get the kindness but why video it the man is trying to eat and the person videoing is clearly doing it for the likes
like i said last time this was reposted this is not an awwww calling it an awwww is offensive and ignorant this is a man eating lunch it s not any of our business to gawk and make it anything other than that what is wrong with some of you people
he makes no big deal so humble let s be more humble yo
i feel bad for those with disabilities not because they were born different but because of the way the majority of people treat them differently and look at them differently for a young girl to step up to the plate and be kind enough to do this in today s world i m impressed
fast food worker as if we re supposed to be shocked that anyone in the fast food industry might help someone else
you react to disabled people the same way you react to puppies
i remember seeing this video before it had a huge impact on me i‚Äôm generally pretty jaded but the compassion displayed by these ladies changed something in me for the better
she probably had to clock out to do this not on our time capitalist society on moral actions
that s beautiful heart warming made my evening better ty for posting üòä
there are so many c s in this world of ours and this person is the complete opposite if this kind of thing was the headline every day maybe we would start heading to a better world
i suffer from a lot of emotional mental disorders and lately has been especially hard but this this makes my heart smile so big thank goodness for people like this
this is kind but shouldn t someone with a disability to this extend be given a caregiver honestly should be burdening a fast food worker with this
you are all disgusting this is a grown man and you are putting him on the same platform as cats and dogs you all disgust me their disability does not define them yet you are letting it
foodservice workers are working class heroes who are criminally underpaid
the skeptic in me wonders why they were filming and if the disabled person would be okay being filmed and having it shared
you want me to cry because this is how you make me cry
people like this need to be given scholarships to pursue a degree in the healthcare field
i can t believe people as good as this need to fight for hr
every single human should help your fellow human with kindness and respect i love to see these post mature humanity to upvote this kind of content thank you humans
i briefly worked at a mcdonalds between high school and college and we had a disabled employee the other members of staff made fun of him but i never did he was a good dude i asked the manager to make sure our breaks occurred at the same time so i could help him honestly i‚Äôm ashamed i didn‚Äôt keep in touch honestly i worked with a lot of assholes but this dude was a great guy i didn‚Äôt mind helping him eat during breaks i just hated the job itself when i went off to university i cut all ties i hope he‚Äôs doing well he deserved more respect than the rest of the assholes i worked with
i m not taking away from the kindness factor but what was this guys plan did he go out to eat alone even though he cant eat without assistance or is it her brother that she is just helping like did he plan on relying on workers to feed him or what i m so confused
the sad part is we let these gem of kind people struggling alone in their life unnoticed we only admire their act of compassion but not their strength in their struggle
–ø–æ–±–æ–ª—å—à–µ –±—ã —Ç–∞–∫–∏—Ö –¥–æ–±—Ä—ã—Ö –ª—é–¥–µ–π –∏ –ø–æ–º–µ–Ω—å—à–µ –±–æ–ª–µ–∑–Ω–µ–π –Ω–∞ –ø–ª–∞–Ω–µ—Ç–µ
this is both heartbreaking and heartwarming and it shows that there are still good people in this fucked world
my heart just that s so heartwarming and so so kind
and y all say your life has more problems even in being in a complete healthy body oh dear mother bless this worker and the disabled
but would they help if either of them were a different race
op person with disabilities people first language is important the disability doesn t define the person
normal paladin going back to classic to apply kings and salv nonstop
the one who filmed that is an asshole downvote incoming
as he s nice no doubt but is it really needed to be recorded to be uploaded to internet
i‚Äôm sure i‚Äôve upvoted this before but come on i love these people both beautiful and brave
kindness like this may not change the world but sure as hell makes it an awful lot brighter
i don t know if my heart hurts because of what i m watching or why i m watching this shouldn t be filmed
its sweet and all but should nt the guy already have someone to help him throughout the day that could be doing this
month ago at work i was on the phone with my manager discussing the way im going to handle something at work on the rd floor of the building time flew and when i hung up i looked at the clock and noticed the working hours been over for a bit so to get my stuff from the it department i moved towards the elevator immediately when i get there having a laptop in my hands i notice there‚Äôs a guy coming from this long hallway on wheelchairs and i feel as if he‚Äôs really struggling to move so i run towards the guy passing over rooms to get to him so that i can help him move to the elevator when we got to the elevator i noticed the elevator was out and i also saw him showing signs of stress about how to get out of that floor of the financial department so i told him to stay put while i go get help from security at the ground level of the building the building is pretty old so it doesn‚Äôt have internal tracks for wheelchairs and stairs aren‚Äôt escalators etc so it‚Äôs only the elevators that get wheelchairs up and down so i get to the ground level and talk to the security guy at the desk i told him there‚Äôs someone stuck on the rd floor and he needs help getting down to the ground level so that he can leave the building at that point two of his co workers behind him turned around and looked at me he paused for a moment and said ‚Äúyeah the elevator been out for an hour and itll take up to tomorrow to fix it go tell his co workers to move him down ‚Äù i said well its minutes past working hours and even if it still was during working hours he is a visitor i spoke to him earlier and he told ne he was retired but they cut his pay and he came to ask why he repeated ‚Äú go get his co workers ‚Äú i was really upset felt this kind of stress all that time about what he he must feels like atm on the rd floor i cant just run up to him and tell him what im told why not use some of that muscle to help someone in need keep in mind that there is over ppl on the ground floor doing security and they weren‚Äôt really doing anything but getting ready to go home i lost my faith but then seeing stuff like this really makes me doubt my judgement there‚Äôs good and there‚Äôs bad but the good really makes me feel there are still people who care for others
i love the fact that she didn‚Äôt seem annoyed or put out by doing it good on her makes me happy to see good humans out there
this brought me tears to my eyes it was really sweet
this is simply beautiful i work at a mom and pop fast food spot and have a few regulars that are handicapped it just always seemed obvious to help them out eating and such its a shame that my coworkers think it‚Äôs weird
now that helps restore my faith in humanity well done you ‚ù§Ô∏è
what a great person good to know that there are still kind people in this world
probably she wasn‚Äôt even paid enough to do it yet she still had a heart of gold
this is making me emotional thank you kind lady for helping this young man
literally one of the best things i ve seen for a while
isn‚Äôt it sad that now a days whenever someone does a good deed that they have to record it like if it was an act people need to practice being kind even if their buddy is not recording it
i love that she doesn‚Äôt look embarrassed at all to do this makes him feel like nothing is different about helping
i got tears in my eyes this should be the norm and upraised due it being so standard while it s a beautiful act why is this such a standout in today s society that s the sad question
this just melted my heart and made me cry inside like a year old baby
i hope that in future generics and cybernetic will change disabeled person in normal person
this has to be one of the best things i ve seen in a while üôå
good shall give her more good things for this act of great kindness
she probably has someone with definity in her entourage probably family
this is one of the most emotional things i‚Äôve seen beautiful
some people get it they re the ones that pick up after the rest
human empathy at its finest if each of us did more acts of kindness just think of the world we could live in
it doesn‚Äôt cost anything or take any extra effort to be kind
this is beautiful but makes me sad at the same time my little brother is low functioning autistic and intellectually disabled he needs help with feeding and other basic functions i would never let him be alone and seeing this guy without family with him makes me sad thank goodness that the worker was helpful just the thought that he may have struggled on his own breaks my heart
that s some of the best customer service i ve ever seen i really don t see how people will ever be replaced by robots
you people think i care that a bunch of random people i‚Äôll never meet downvoted my comment wow lol instead of farming for karma how bout you go outside and get some fresh air
thats a guy who i want to get at least and hour at his mcdonalds job
and the news media will have you believe our country is divided
this is in brasil i can recognize from the giraffa s
this that wholesome wholesome shit i needed today thank you
looks like a very popular fast food chain here in brazil giraffa s
ba nu bu bah bah i don t get paid enough for this but it is very sweet enjoy internet points
sad thing is that in my school its difficult to even get people to glance at the disabled kids they actually have to run them on a completely seperate schedule so that they dont get bullied by any of the other kids
yet some cunts throw drinks at them fucking species
this does not have to be mcdonadl s looks like a dining area for mall buffets and restaurants this does not need filming but with all the shit in the internet and crappy humans it s nice to see good hearted humans helping and actually giving a shit
this has helped feel so much better in light of all the ohio alabama bullshit despite seeing so many awful things on reddit these posts are what keeps me coming back
this is beautiful we need to take care of each other
lovely and all but unless the person filming got permission then taking this video in secret for internet points is a lil creepy nobody wants to be filmed eating regardless of context
that s sooo wholesome wanna give both of them a hug üòä
finally something that isn t worshipping cats and dogs
omg sososo nice love the disabled man just because your disabled doesnt mean you cant do the things you love
please accept my upvote don t have a gold to give you
just feel good stuff faith in humanity temporarily restored
this touches my heart my dad developed alzheimer‚Äôs among other issues and before he passed i had to help him eat some days a single meal would take nearly two hours for him to eat but we kept pushing through would do it all over again
i need more of this in my life i have been way too focused on the negative things but there are so many good people and reason to love other humans
this is an amazingly kind gesture from the employee but when did it become the norm to brazenly record strangers private moments just doesn t sit right with me am i missing the point here
this is what being a good human looks like humansbeingbros
cool let s take a video of it and make a spectacle of it for reddit karma and then post it to awww to really mine that karma what was done in this moment was great everything else cringeworthy
both deserve hugs i wanna give them both hugs i like hugs
this is so sweet it looks like this isn t the first time i bet he feels safe so much awesome
if i was this business owner i would promote this lady instantly
god i love seeing such heart warming things like this
o k so maybe the human race is not beyond redemption good on her
if he needs somebody to help him eat then why did he go to a restaurant alone
i anticipate a boss getting pissy that she isn t manning a station
folks like this those kind to the disabled homeless the sad are a gift to humanity more are needed for sure
sometimes the homies just need a hand and the real ones know it‚Äôs really nothing
this is strange because they barely get paid enough to survive
never before have i wished i could upvote more than once but this this deserves it
how i ve worked at the golden arches before and they do not let their employees stop working to take care of personal tasks
this is beautiful she doesn‚Äôt have her phone out she‚Äôs not doing it for ‚Äúkarma ‚Äù or any ‚Äúlikes ‚Äù or internet points which isn‚Äôt to say all people do it‚Äôs just beautiful to see someone doing something nice for another human simply because they can and want to
stop making me cry as a grown man in public please üòê
i love how there‚Äôs no bullshit dialogue during the entire process it felt genuine
"omg tears sprung to my eyes it s come to this i see a touch of human kindness
and i m a weeping mess"
i try to let at least cars go in front of me instead of getting mad like everyone else does in traffic
i have mixed feelings about this obviously i love it and it makes me incredibly happy that people will take time out of there day to help others in need but i find it incredibly sad that this is an odd occurrence and that we celebrate it so much because it‚Äôs in fact so rare
if a nice deed is done and no one films it is it still a nice deed why do people have to film stuff like this give the dude some dignity and get the fucking camera out of his face
that s really nice to see it makes me wonder how this man eats on a regular basis can he feed himself if he wanted but it s easier to be fed by someone else or was his social worker on a sick day so he requested to be fed i m curious what the situation was
even tho i love them for it i would love to see him eat sth better than junk of course he might not have a lot of money neve the less very wholesome
where can i donate to this kind lady‚Äôs education seriously she deserves it
the worker should have her name face on the wall as employee of the year such kindness is extremely rare
as kind as this is asking a person who is disabled if they need help or doing little things to help them out is something myself and probably many others try to avoid doing not to be a jerk but to simply not offend them some people accept the help while others get offended because of that i feel like most people within reason would rather not help in fear of offending them i remember when i was working at a restaurant my boss offered a straw to a person with cerebral palsy they took the straw but you could tell by looking at them and their family that they were extremely offended he moved the straw his mom then picked it up and slammed it onto the other side of the table while he was chugging down on his coke however it s always kinda heart warming every time you see one of these videos
you know at first i found it weird that the worker wasn‚Äôt smiling and thought maybe they were ordered to do it by their manager and maybe they were but if they weren‚Äôt then then doing that for the customer makes it an even better deed cause they‚Äôre not doing it to feel good about themselves and pat themselves on the back and have a good time they‚Äôre doing it cause it‚Äôs the right thing to do
my heart just started beating and i am experiencing emotions what is this why would anyone want this
too bad society is so fucked up to both of these people
while this is awesome that s not helping him eat that s feeding him huge difference
she s a better human in that moment than i will ever be
just when i‚Äôm about to lose all faith in this place
as a sibling of a special needs kid it‚Äôs really pure to see this much kindness and love from someone
this brings tears to my eyes i can‚Äôt fucking wait to be a nurse
person with a disability gt disabled person it‚Äôs subtle but we shouldn‚Äôt define a person by their disability another example is a child with autism vs an autistic child
this makes me tear up what a wonderful person it makes my heart so warm knowing that there‚Äôs still good people like this in the world not much makes me tear up but this does put a smile on my face
man this hit me right in the feels i m a right pessimistic prick especially when it comes to us humans but i also often forget how compassionate we can be too much love to these two
i honestly cannot do this i‚Äôd gladly help clean ditches or other community service but other people‚Äôs bodily functions is just a no go for me i can‚Äôt do it saliva on food is where i draw the line you can‚Äôt get past me by licking food drool it‚Äôs yours
people making minimum wage going way out of their way to be a good worker awesome
glad to see there are still some people like this left in the world ü•∞‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
beautiful to see and more important to know that are still good people out there her company owes her a raise and a commendation
kinda upsetting that i see virtually none of this in day to day life and on the internet this is how humans should treat one another instead of always trying to better one another at literally everything in life every second of the day
this is what religion should be like this is what our lord tried to teach us and this is called humanity there is a teaching that says whatsoever we do to the least of my brother that you do unto me
i can t help think that there s a person camera person that s caring for the disabled person forced the worker to do this
darn it who‚Äôs chopping onions at mcdonald‚Äôs you‚Äôve cut too many üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
this disgusts me for so many reasons weakening our gene pool by keeping people alive that can‚Äôt feed themselves and shouldn‚Äôt exist not doing her job and placing the responsibility of excess work on her coworkers the sight makes me want to vomit and i‚Äôve seen my cat lick his own asshole i‚Äôd leave this place and never go back if i saw this the huge circle jerk the rest of you are all doing with the bs this is so wholesome making other customers wait in line longer due to one less cashier not to mention less seating available
there‚Äôs a gentleman like this who comes into the movie theatre i run every sunday morning same ballpark showtime sweetest guy every single employee loves him and argues over who gets to help him get his food ready and set up in the theatre it‚Äôs heart warming
all mentally handicapped should be euthanized automatically i mean it should be the norm
what i see is some future nurses that is obviously what those two ladies should be doing given how bright and big and red their hearts are
i always want to offer people like this help but i don t want to be disrespectful and assume they need my help
its good to actually see people doing good deed once an a while im always in my house haha
i want to hear their conversation and the conversation before this
we need more people like this in our world absolutely makes my heart so happy
i hope company sees this and rewards this amazing act
this makes my heart happy as someone who works with the disabled seeing someone just do this so a person can enjoy a meal we need more people like this in the world
this might be the only repost i m always glad to see again and again
i am in need of some awww not some awww proceeds to cry wwwwwww
i want to know the name of that woman god bless her
you can see the poor man looking around like yeah i know i m disabled i hate it this hurts my heart so much i would hug him
people with disabilities have always had a special place in my heart since elementary school be grateful for what you have ya ll always love and help each other i love you all even the hateful ones
shouldn t say fast food worker it should say incredible person
what the fuck this post does not belong here awwwwwwwwwwww they re helping the pooooor heeeeelpless guy eat i know not everyone takes it that way but that s how it comes across to many people with disabilities it s not ok
fuck this aww shit it is extremely degrading and exploitative to that young man and disabled people we do not exist for your inspiration nor are we objects to make ablebodied people feel good someone helping him shouldn t be seen as some big or adorable thing if i were in his position i wouldn t want this extra attention treat us like normal people please
when i was at tim hortons i once brought coffee to a man s table because the poor old man s hands were shaking so much
why why do you have to record it all such a person wants is to feel normal and there you are recording it and posting it for the whole world to see all i see is praise for the worker but no one cares to think what that guy is feeling in that moment it would be a lot more wholesome without the camera
she should be doing what she is paid to do if he can t feed himself why is he even there
i love this world i wouldn‚Äôt want to be anywhere else
i don‚Äôt know who those fast food workers are but god bless you i grew up with handicapped sisters so this warms my pumper
give this worker the world she‚Äôs earned far more than that kindness is always in style i wanna hug these people this warmed my heart
whenever i see good people like this i always wanted to be able to hire them into the career of their choice assuming they d want to leave
truly beautiful it‚Äôs great to know we still look out for each other hopefully she is found and gets the praise she deserves
my question is why is he by himself i guess there s multiple factors but still i just wonder
goddamn this just made me feel a million things compassion is one of humanities greatest traits
true story i worked at a mcdonalds in texas one day a blind woman enters in mcdonalds and we greet everyone that walks in i see she is heading for the men‚Äôs restroom so i walk around the counter towards her she reaches for the handle but i mention to her before the door opens that the door she was opening was the men‚Äôs room i asked if she needed help reaching the woman‚Äôs restroom and she said ‚Äúwould you please‚Äù i told her i would be reaching my hand out to her to guide her and i opened the door for her and closed as soon as she was safely out of the closing door reach went back to the counter and finished the rest of my day with a smile and a good heart
that s really cute and kind if they d been other people they would ve said something like if you can t eat by yourself then don t come to these places but everyone has the right to enjoy the meal they want this girl has gave me a little more hope in humanity she s a true hero we need more people like her
we need her name and guve her something dublicate her or something
best thing on the internet today god bless them both
this needs to be on the front news page spread positivity for once
there s so many questions i have for this video it would reveal me to be an asshole
bless their hearts and all people that do good for others for that matter just the simplest thing can help someone never do something expecting something in return do it because it is the right thing to do and because you never know what people are going through
this shit right here this is the stuff that brings tears to my eyes humans being fucking decent to each other i ve seen this video amp a similar one once before both times the employee wasn t ordered or forced to help they just did
let‚Äôs make her famous and get someone with a big business give her a job
this is beautiful this is what being human is bless her
we‚Äôve all worked a job like this and doing this is much more preferable than the usual duties and it‚Äôs just a chance to sit down
that s so nice of her i want to help people but this cruel world sometimes make me cruel and selfish when i see such videos then it motivates me to be better person can anyone help me with such subreddits where people i can see the gif like these people helping each other
it upsets me that they feel the need to take a video while they re doing a good deed it makes me question the validity of the entire situation is she doing it because she s a genuine human being or just doing it for internet karma
this is rude af if i was the person being fed i d question why i m being video tapped being fed am i a zoo animal that you are all so impressed someone is helping why are you filming i think we are too congratulatory of ourselves to try and find hope when we can just be more mindful as a species
why does everybody have to turn everything into a negative thing and everything is not about karma you dumb fuck
i work at starbucks and i‚Äôve counted a disabled guy‚Äôs money for him he has no hands just hooks i bring his pike place coffee to the table mix the sugar and milk and put a straw in it for him
this literally brings me to tears the world can be so beautiful i wish i could see these acts of pure kindness everyday i wish the very best for that man and kind employee
awww so nice of her that is good woman awwwww wery nice
i adore this kind of people so much being a worker it s not easy to do another job but this girl wow
this melts my heart people like this gives me hope that we as human are beautiful
this is rude af if i was the person being fed i d question why i m being video tapped being fed am i a zoo animal that you are all so impressed someone is helping why are you filming seriously why are we bringing attention to anyone s disability at all good for her for helping but i think we are too congratulatory of ourselves to try and find hope when we can just be more mindful as a species
this is not an aww moment it s someone trying to eat their food in peace inspiration pron is disgusting and doesn t help any of us in the disabled community in fact it does the opposite we do not like being called inspiring or strong for just minding our own business and going about our lives how would you like someone taking a photo of you and plastering it on the inter net because of out dated ideas and beliefs
they don t deserve more than minimum wage they re lucky they re not kiosks
a woman like this is definitely worth marrying unfortunately i don t even have what it takes to live on the same planet as her
but i thought a person s worth was how good their job or education is
i can t believe there are people out there actually ripping off those naive little pups üòî
as a hairdresser in trianing this makes me so happy where can i find clients this cute
he‚Äôs not exactly sure what‚Äôs happening but he‚Äôs happy to be a part of it
i can‚Äôt believe you have no name i‚Äôm so so sorry at least you have this good boy videos
i don t know what s going on but i m having a great time
that boy s got a cleaner cut than me i gotta find his barber
this fuckin stud with his new fade leave some bitches for the rest of us
omg i miss my dog so much i moved to germany waited months to move into an apartment so obvious bring my dog over i moved in and my landlord was a nightmare and so i moved out and returned my dog to the uk to stay until i find another apartment i m seriously thinking of quitting my job and moving back to the uk because i miss my dog so much
this is like the real life version of mr peanutbutter
in the thumbnail all i could see is that it was a golden retriever my brain went to you don t cut the coat of a golden then i clicked on the link very cute
"wait a second squints
they re not evening cutting his hair when will the lies stop"
this barber clearly is blind wasn t even cutting anything pfft
idk man that cut seems like a rip off barely a difference
"doggyboi ‚Äúhey she‚Äôs not actually cuttin‚Äô me hair is she ‚Äù
video taper ‚Äúnope‚Äù
doggyboi ‚Äúwhat is this voodoo magic why you playin‚Äô ‚Äù"
itt people who are so literal it makes my brain hurt
my dog would have a panic attack at the scissors my sister is the only one who can go near him to trim eye hair etc
i had a dog way back that we had to trim the hair from in front of his eyes so he could see man dogs and scissors still gives me anxiety all it has to do is move it‚Äôs head wrong and it‚Äôs been stabbed
next time i d ask for a razor cut around the ears to bring out the natural wave just some beach wave spray on damp fur and you re done
he gonna be mad when he realizes the sneaky that was pulled on him
he does better than my kids do in a hairdresser s chair
why is he wearing an apron like he cant get hair on his hair
omg his ears twitching when the scissors make noise üò≠üò≠üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è
this is cool wait what s going on ya sick wait what s going on great ok
his hair stands so incredibly still that you can t see it
must be a witch or wizard cutting that hair with that distance of the scissors
idk this kinda gave me anxiety with him moving his head amp ears so much so close to the scissors üò®
looks like the sequel to the hamster on a video call meme
i m kinda sobbing now i miss my big ear buddies and their sniffly noses should i get more
saw a video of women kick him outta the house earlier
i m sorry op but this pupper already took all the power from you in the household üôàüòä
aw that‚Äôs a handsome boy you won‚Äôt be able to say no to him with those eyes
so cute he s going to get many treats with those puppy eyes
i just lost my year old golden this morning they are by far the most wonderful dogs congrats to you ‚ù§Ô∏è
all i see is a snake sizing up its prey snakes are not fully domesticated and unlike cats they don t fully appreciate the artificial symbiosis recreate
had a couple little kids killed by a snake like this in canada a about years ago
its more of a wtf how on earth did she get to be this big with such a big ass dangernoodle being all cuddly
the fuck is wrong with people that keep big snakes like this for bets with children in the house like that thing will strangle the child
i love how everyone is freaking out and obv the girl is fine or this wouldn t be posted
yeah this is just stupid next will be the kid plays with the snake when parents aren‚Äôt around and then kid disappears
clearly this animal is being monitored during its interaction with the child hence the video you re watching thats good parenting additionally this child seems to be knowledgeable on how to handle the animal
i swear this gets grainier every time it s reposted
repost but still beuatiful i love this every time i see it
i love how in the original the guy actually says ‚Äûsquirt squirt‚Äú when he gives the second honeydoggo his ‚Äûmedicine‚Äú üíï
hes smarter than that üòâ he just knew he d get ear rubs at the end hehehe
my shit zuh gets eye medication every day and the other one acts bummed if i don‚Äôt fake him too
my floppy eared dogs went through this one of them became impatient with how often we addressed their ears and started cleaning the others now we only have to clean one dog s ears
first the puppy police dog repost now this fuck this sub
you have to take rubbing alcohol and sanitize the tip of the applicator people
i wish my cat had accepted ear drops like this i had to wrap her up in a towel like an angry grr ito so she wouldn t run and or slice my face i think this dog just wanted extra ear scratches who can blame him they look awesome
what could have been wrong with the first dog that s he needed the medicine
every time i brush out my corgi my boxer waits in line for her turn because she thinks she also needs brushing
my mom has to do that with her chihuahuas otherwise one feels left out lol
i love how he entertains it ‚Äúok come here buddy you can have some too ‚Äù pretends to put medicine on as he rolls his eyes on the inside
i have two dogs and when i take them out for a walk one of them wants allll the collars he tries to get in the other dogs collar then he has his then we put a flashing one on him and if i pick up an old collar he sticks his head through that one too i just give him his two he doesn‚Äôt need three or more lol
when ever i clean my big dog‚Äôs ears prone to ear infection my little one sits there and demands i also clean his ears even though he hates it
that guy looks like every army general in a movie ever
that s so cute that their human indulges the nd one aww
good luck with that mometamax source my beagle is cute but has beagle ears
how the hell do you do it my dog didn t mind at all when i used tissues but now i have to put the medicine in and she runs at every attempt
the dog sadly waiting it‚Äôs turn for the medicine that will battle it‚Äôs life threatening illness ‚òπÔ∏è
the gentleman‚Äôs smirk when he scratches the second set of ears is so so funny
you fool you fell victim to one of the classic blunders
i don t mean to intrude but i m gonna need the same level of care as kyle üê∂üòÇ
haha my dog does this too the one has allergies and we have to put drops in his ears and tell him he s a good boy the other waits in line and we have to pretend to put medicine in his ear and tell him he is also a very good boy
my one dog has that exact same ear medicine and my other dog always comes over because she gets jealous thinking he s getting treats and love without her
my doggos love them ear rubs but they can sense when i take out the bottle of ear cleaner drops it s never a big deal and i think it actually feels good by how they act during the sec cleaning but you would think i m coming after them with a hot iron poker instead of drops amp cookies
meanwhile when my dog needs ear medication she runs at the sight of the bottle
nice my dog always runs away when i pull out the ear medicine i try and give her treats before and after and then taking her for a walk to minimize her discomfort but she still reacts the same way
my dog is exactly like that about ear drops except the exact opposite such a wimp
this is insane every dog i ve ever had has acted like i m trying to brutally murder him when i ve needed to give him ear meds
it makes sense imagine how you would feel if you had no access to qtips
oh my soul my dog this as well lola gets brushed rosie too shaved rosie too nails cut rosie too in fact she ll push my hand out of the way to stop any activity with lola except for baths they both run and hide
wish my dog would act like this for his ear medicine instead it turn into a game of chase
my dog hates ear medication and she needs it pretty regularly
i literally wrestled with my dog for an hour to get the drops in both ears then the next day took her to the vet and let them do some other treatment
did did you record this on a monitor so you could repost it at least screen cap it bro wtf
who keeps upvoting an awarding reposts come on people
you lucky guy mine just see the shadow of the bottle and he becomes a fear tornado all over the house most likely going under a bed or running fast as hell he hates ear drops lmao
my dog needs medicine and does not want it s ear touched she gets paranoid and escapes we have to hold her down with people
my dog does this when i wipe my shih tzu‚Äôs eyes haha she insists that i wipe hers a bit too
you could have at least reposted this with the sound he says squirt squirt squirt when he gives the pupper his fake medicine it s so cute
my dog has allergies so i need to clean his ears often and sometimes he still gets infections that require ear drops he hates all of the above i have to trick him into letting me clean put drops in thank goodness for peanut butter kongs
i ve used that as a trick to give one dog eye drops fake giving the other dog drops then say he s a good dog and give him a treat the other dogs feels like he is missing out on something and wants eye drops too
wish my dog knew that i was basically just trying to give him an ear massage cause it usually seems like he is trying to learn how to speak just so he can say nooooo
the idea of a pet willingly taking ear medication is mind boggling
ok i will always love this video always but wtf at this sub the past few days like some really old videos and pictures being posted and awarded
our youngest goldie queues for ear cleaning and drops when our labrador needs them he also pushes the others out the way to go first for feet trims he knows these things are followed by biscuits and won t be denied
do you know what happened to him or was he born like that
he s amazing my first thought when i saw him in human form he d be the older man who lives in the shack by the sea probably near a cliff one eye gimpy leg and a shitload of crazy stories about his past that every writes off as that s just crazy jack then like two weeks after his funeral everyone finds out the stories were all true
all i ask is just one photo of a lil pirate hat and eye patch
will you take care of him he deserves the best such a beautiful cat
lost one eye and quite clearly or not so clearly has bad cat aracts in the other eye probably can t see much at all still looks like a happy cat snaggletooth and all
that s a handsome jack right there how s hyperion buddy
i woke up one morning married to a pineapple an ugly pineapple
gorgeous we have a one eyed black kitty who is the best we adopted him from the shelter and he had been there for years and they said he was ‚Äúunadoptable‚Äù because he was black and missing an eye two weeks after we took him home the shelter called and begged us to let him come back as they missed him we were already in love of course and said no and that was he is a senior kitty now but jack is as special as our columbo and i‚Äôm sure just as loved gorgeous baby give him kisses from me
jack looks like he should be on the wanted poster with that dog from last week
this is an oracle cat he can see the future but will never tell
give him an eye patch and a tooth sword and he ll be so ready to take on the fearsome rudy
that s so weird my brother has a dog named black jack that also has lost an eye
not handsome is deformed please do not post again thanks
these pet cemetery adds are getting really realistic
i was gonna say he looks like he s seen some shit but i guess not
if his one eye is gone than that means he is forever winking at you too cute
that s the best damn pirate i ve ever seen pirates of the carabien music starts playing
our cat also has a cleft lip hes also missing most of his teeth too hes not very old and a vet guessed it could have been oral trauma as a kitten that caused them to not grow in properly
i am what i am i would tell you what you want to know if i could for you have been kind to me but i am a cat and no cat anywhere ever gave anyone a straight answer
if only handsome jack could talk the stories he would tell
bless you jack i hope you know now that not all humans are mean and will hurt you bless your owners for taking you in and providing a safe haven for you for the rest of your life i send you a big hug and some ear scritches

bro your cat just blew through your entire stash of cocaine

the coloring on his face makes him look like a rabbit
i see adorable black markings on a mostly white furred cat i never saw anything on rorschach which like many other miscalculations in psychiatry have been invalidated due to wake up calls by better shrink research except as with this wonderful feline black blots shapes genetically inspired in cat s example uninspired in case of baloney shrinkology
looks like they re play choking lol black dog s expression is just awesome
they both look so happy nothing like living in the moment
looks like they re about to become more than friends
why does this look like a ‚Äúlook we have diversity‚Äù photo on a college website üòπüòπ
black doggo s coat sure is shiny good job dog mom dad
the black dog looks like the emissary of the gorgonites
that photo looks epic than any photo i have taken or will take
if you photoshop the lower half of the white dog out it would look like the black dog is wearing one of those cool wolf animal skins you‚Äôd see in a show like game of thrones
do you happen to know what type of dog the black one is my rescue mutt has a lot of similar features to them and i ve been too cheap to spring for one of those dog dna tests
i wish i could find a friend for my dog but every dog is so mean to him
think about it this is very strange here we are on this ball on space called earth the only known planet to have life among the life in this planet we have these furry good boys who love us what did we do to deserve them
act normal and you will live now tell me where is the toy
this is one of those wish you were here post card pictures that dogs send to each other whenever they visit exotic dog parks
she s so adorable üòç‚ù§ and with disney eyes and puppy hobby ü§£ that s a perfect kitty ‚ù§
scout isn t always good at it sometimes she comes back with something entirely different and sometimes she comes back with nothing and meows at me but she loves it
scout isn t always good at it sometimes she comes back with something entirely different and sometimes she comes back with nothing and just meows at me but she loves it
i love it i wish my lola aka lola bola and lola bean would play catch i also have a layla aka layla bayla out of the two lola is definitely the wild one i just can‚Äôt for the life of me get her to play fetch
here human you dropped this i made sure it was dead now give me scritches
lots of cats play fetch without dogs being involved i m not sure if you can teach them it or if they re just either fetch cats or aren t had growing up only fetched but the other one was smart enough to choose which treats she wanted when given a choice
love the cat style delivery a dog would place it back at your feet and wag their tail waiting for the next round instead cat tosses it on the floor here s your damn toy back try not to be so clumsy next time
both of my cats play fetch and i‚Äôm not sure what i did to deserve them üòÇ but they also demand fetch at am by dropping toys on my face
my dog turned into a cat since ours was older and had i guess let her follow her lead when she was a puppy
am i the only one who questions the use of the gate
when she picks it up she doesn t go straight for you she actually turns the other way i just find it funny how cats pretend to not care
my gustav fetches but his sister doesn t they don t know any dogs cute kitty
aww the question mark tail as she drops the toy back that s a happy kitty
i have a yr old orange tabby that plays fetch mostly with drinking straws he‚Äôll steal them from fast food cups a few nights ago he kept waking me up by patting my forehead while i was trying to sleep and then dropping a straw on my face for me to throw for him was too cute for me to be mad
cats‚Äô jumping ability makes dogs look a little silly sometimes
pupper doesn‚Äôt mess around when hands are being thrown
love that he keeps swinging after getting the knockout no mercy
that was the equivalent to ‚Äúyou‚Äôre okay it‚Äôs okay don‚Äôt tell mom you‚Äôre fine get up ‚Äù
ill be sitting and my dog will come up to me to say he needs to poop if i dont put my arm out my dog will bitch slap me out of excitement i know this feeling lol

all we need is some shoulder to lean on music intensifies
god damn why do kittens have to be so fucking cute i‚Äôll take please
ahh choo ü§ß i wish i wasn t allergic to cats so precious
the best thing about kittens is that they exist also lookit those little paws i m dying omg
this is the th video of a cute guy with kittens reddit is amazing right now ‚ù§Ô∏è
it s all fun and games until your full grown cat has now established the corner of your neck and shoulder as his forever sleeping spot and drools all over you clawing at your scalp in the middle of the night
i want a kitten i already have cats and my husband says i cant have any more cuz then he will be outnumbered
reminds me of my cat tiger pants he had eye goop issues and even bigger bathroom issues but i knew there was something special there he was estimated to live maybe five years he made it to needed frequent bathing but he was the greatest smuggler of all time
oh my goodness thank you for helping this sweet girl she deserved better and she got it congrats on your new family member
i took in an fiv tomcat and his teeth are so bad but they said he‚Äôs too high risk to get a real dental he‚Äôs in blep mode of the time and all he wants are snuggles
awwww thank you for taking her in and saving her life
i cannot comprehend how humans can be such dirtbags thankfully there are good people like you in this world
i sure her heart is broken but you are the best for taking her in and giving her the love she deserves
had the same situation they moved and left their cat on the street because i had cats he migrated to my house had him about ish years figured he was probably when i lost him one of the best cats i ever had the pleasure to know so much personality
thank you for saving that beautiful girl‚ù£Ô∏è she will be a faithful companion‚ù£Ô∏è
she is beautiful she looks so sweet talk to the vet if she s positive we took in an fiv cat while we had others and the vet said the chances of her passing it to them were barely higher than the chances of them getting outside and catching it from another cat she was a pacifist anyway so she never had a real fight with anybody in the house
good for you we just had to pull teeth from our rescue because the previous owners were morons she s by far the most affectionate car ive ever had take care of her she deserves all the love
thank you for giving this kitty the care and love she deserves and kick your old neighbors in the nuts if you ever have the misfortune of seeing them again
thank you for rescuing her i hope her previous owners can be charged with animal abuse
oh she is precious i don‚Äôt understand how people just leave their pets my aunts neighbor did that like dogs and a few cats just let them out and took off in a moving truck
please please give this kitty a little bit of chicken and lots of face rubs and cuddles from me she‚Äôs such a pretty kitty ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
thank you we need more of your kindness in the world
it s illegal to abandon pets you should report them
give her some hugs amp skritches from me amp fuck your neighbors
people suck glad you guys took the cat in please update us on kitty status
iirc there‚Äôs a law that prohibits abandoning pets like this if yes how to report it
she is clearly very suspicious of you perhaps she thinks that you were involved in the sudden disappearance of her former owners they moved out you say how very convenient ü§î
old kitties are amazing so much loves to give both ways
thank you for taking her in now she ll live her best life that with people that really do give a damn about this sweet girl need more people like ya ll in the world üòä
you‚Äôve got a good soul thank you for saving that precious thing ‚úåüèª
years ago my dad and his friend broke a window of a house that been sold and vacant for at least a week inside were several kitties hungry thirsty and afraid we ended up keeping one sweet girl and the others went to other friends there have always been good people and assholes out there
sounds like they were sucky parents i‚Äôm so glad you got her
thanks to you she is now loved and cared for what a sweet cat she is how can some people be no cruel don‚Äôt understand
inherited a cat like that from a neighbor who left an abusive relationship and left the cat behind her asshole of an ex boyfriend let the cat outside to fend for itself he was the sweetest lap cat just wanted to be near you only had him a short time as he died of cancer a few months after i took him in still think of that kitty fritz he was such a good cat wish he would have lived longer
can you in coming weeks or months post this beautiful lady when she‚Äôs recovered
thank you so much for giving me hope in humanity for being a good human ‚ô°
bless you karma to the people that left her behind and didn t look after her properly
what are their names and where‚Äôd they move to no reason
i know it is the eye infection because of the redness i can see but his eyes seem like he has a look of what on god s green earth are you up to right now alex you doing some suspicious junk again i won t be having that
if it weren t for folks like you i d be under a bridge or worse too
i just finished watching monty python this scared me a bit
jealous who said i was jealous of a young girl who gets to be with that bunny your jealous
has anyone ever heard of successfully house training a rabbit
big cocoa puff on instagram in case anyone wants to see more
so this is how big rabbits get if you dont forget about them after easter ü§î
holy crap if i went hunting and saw that i d turn around and go back home
for some reason i find this rabbit terrifying the stuff of nightmares
i bet when that thing poops it s like a pile of apples
i was just telling my kids that i was gonna get them a bunny imagine the look on their faces when i bring home b u n z i l l a
the plot twist is that the bunny is normal size but the girl and the kitchen are exceptionally tiny
i wonder how old that little girl will be when she realizes just how freakishly huge her pet bunny was
they are great pets he‚Äôs not a huge cuddlier like others i‚Äôve had but i‚Äôm working on it i can still hold him and kiss him he lives with dogs and cats and a chinchilla his best buddy he is awesome with his litter box he has chewed a couple wires üò¨ but otherwise he‚Äôs good not chewing things as long as he has hay and cardboard to chew on i‚Äôve had some that were real chewers they shed a lot some more then others i‚Äôve had at least one or more rabbits for years now i can‚Äôt imagine not having one
pets are basically children this video only suggests it further
goddamn thats a big rabbit don t bunnys have crazy metabolisms how much would that thing eat
most indoor rabbits like to chew through your wires this thing will chew through the legs on your table
back in my day when i was knee high to my pet rabbit
jesus christ what the hell are you feeding rabitsaurus rex
flemish giant i m happy to see it being shown what awesome pets a bun bun can be
i didn t know bunny could be terrifying but this is a bit scary
cute and all but i do hope people realise these are the rabbits we eat
somehow this reminds me of the biggest bunny killed by united airlines
i‚Äôve always wanted a bunny the size of a small child and now it looks like i‚Äôm able to do so
this is what i should have got my year old rather than a german shepherd land shark she eventually will be a good
happiness is a warm bunn i like big bunns and i cannot lie
love the flemish giants very much like a dog except their poop is conveniently ok to pick up w o gagging their pee though is like an acid that eats your wood floor when you miss a spot high stakes pet
they re called g√©ants des flandres in french what s the english name for these cuties
wow i want one can someone tell me whether they are harder to take care of as pets than cats or dogs are they allowed to go outdoors by themselves like cats
his name is cocoa bean and he is a giant continental i follow him on the ig
have a pet shop near me that has a bunny a little bugger than this all white weird red eyes it just roams free all day i kind of get scared of it imagine would that bite could do to you
i remember our regular size rabbit and the smell i can t even imagine this one
that is not a bunny that is just a vegan long eared dog change my mind
i awwwwed at the bunny idiot dog jumped in my lap pretty sure my medium size dog and the bunny are about the same size also suspect that the bunny outweighs the kid is that a flemish giant rabbit or did he find some bodybuilder s secret stash
i‚Äôve been bitten by a rabbit and it hurts imagine this absolute unit getting angry and chomping on your hand
make a nice pair of gloves amp collar annd maybe even a little hat for princess
i guess we missled by only having the girl as size comparsion she herself may be some or cm so the bunny isnt really that big just very big
always ask big chungus permission before petting him
damn wonder what the size of raisins that bunny leaves
your child may be retarded i recommend monthly visits until you re sure
about the size of my pet dog apollo bunnies like this grown that big
what an absolute unit xd amp x b he s fat as fuck but adorable
irresponsible parenting i would be afraid of my child getting eaten
that s the most patient bunny i ve ever seen it even lies down with the girl ü§©
this is the kind of bunny you kill for the quests in the starting areas
this thing probably shits bigger than me but all over the floor
make no mistake this bunny is shitting everywhere the whole time
"i can‚Äôt watch this video without having a single thought about
big chungus"
holy cow i mean holy bunny i have never seen a rabbit that big except for the fake jackalope at wall drug lol
buns poop like an insane amount i bet his are like golf balls üòÇüòÇüòÇ
rabbits are such wonderful pets i had no idea how much that could learn my rabbit is toilet trained full free range and can use our stairs it s really awesome he s about now and is such a joy
that is one huge bunny even adults will have problem carrying the bunny
where are all the comments saying c h o n k e y boy
tl dr correction it s a r o u s commonly found in the fire swamp
oh yeah damn damn boi damn boi he thicc boi that s a thicc ass boi damn ba paaa
that thing is a monster i wouldn‚Äôt let it around my dog for fear of my dog being injured
it s like someone glued bunny ears on a furry capybara
what s with all these giant bunnies and how do i get one
flemish giants are very gentle unlike mini flops total jerks
rex rabbits are arguably some of the very best buns out there so soft cute sweet amp since they re large amp squishy they re the perfect bun buns to hug
i ve heard they recently added more hops yeah i m going to need to see some id
your scientists were so preoccupied with¬†whether they¬†could they¬†didn t stop to think¬†if they should

he would make a great somebody‚Äôs cat any way you adopt him or find him a home
he‚Äôs such a cute little guy is he the certified rat bird catcher now
lol i recognize you someone stole and reposted a picture of you with a rabbit yesterday looks like it got removed though
why would you leave a girl in the greenhouse for that long
lol gulliver is cute but let s hope he doesn t fall in with the yahoo s
when i was i worked in a wholesale nursery i kinda miss it didn t have to interact with customers and i often had a massive greenhouse of large plants all to myself it was kinda nice
you should adopt him as the official green house kitty after getting him checked for a chip and neutered first if he hasn t been already
my fondest memories are working at a plant nursery this makes me miss those days
i have no idea where this greenhouse is but i can t stop reading the title in a british accent
who wouldn‚Äôt want to be in any place with that face
lot of creeps on this post i hate the creeps too but this is more of a selfie than a cat photo
look on that face you are the highest vantage point in this place i care about nothing more
could it be a neighbors cat seems super friendly and one of my asshole cats likes to roam pretty far away i‚Äôll see my neighbors cats blocks away from their house
i can t even focus on the cat because of your beautiful eyes
i wish i knew how to grow stuff the soils around here arent too kind to plants that arent weeds
i didn t knwo cats could use reddit she is very cute indeed
damn cat that s a cool greenhouse you have congrats on the adoption of the stray human
anyone else ever told you that you look like emilia clarke i tought this was a post from the game of thrones subreddit at first
it s sad that she is the love of your life since she got a way shorter lifespan than you do
ahhh please give her some extra smooshing on my behalf
got one currently in her last years she has been the most loyal and lovely a dog can ever be amp x b give this boy a hug from us
weeks old and that big a huge breed i assume adorable tho ‚ù§Ô∏è

not to be dramatic or anything but i would give her so many pets
we had a gsd pyr mix one of the smartest dogs i ve ever known you re in for the time of your life also expect to find random tufts of fur for the next few decades
that s one precious ball of fluff i m trying to adopt a pyrenees lab mix myself
great mix a loving loyal beautiful dog i would begin his training now because this probably is an extremely intelligent beauty and is gonna be a big one please update i love both these breeds but have never been lucky enough to share a home with either happiness to you and bailey
my gosh so sweet my fluffy white girl send this fluffy white pupper some love

i d like of the endless kitty boxes and a large coke
i really thought the first two would get stuck but i forgot cats are liquid
the first two almost popped their little kitty eyes out
it‚Äôs like the cute version of that scene from alien
if you were to hold one they would just slip through your fingers
i‚Äôm really sad this doesn‚Äôt happen daily at my house
i think i read they have no collar bones makes it easier to get through small spaces
dunno why they can‚Äôt take turns but it‚Äôs cat logic üôÄ
awww that is so cut what the heck there are more pouring out
genie you get one wish me i want a cardboard box that endlessly dispenses kittens genie wish granted me eeeeeeeeeee
haha i knew there would be at least one kitty that would try to go back through the hole
it s so cute looks like he still has some growing to do
fairy type evolutions are the best part of a pokedex
the grass has come on a treat too not a lot of people know that puppers are great for lawns well done max lovely job
that s a smart dog you could train him to do brain rocket science
how old was he in the baby pic i just got an aussie mix and i m trying to guess how his coat will develop
to anyone wondering he is an australian shepherd mixed with border collie
i bet i know why you named him max he s only got two speeds‚Äîsleeping and max haha looks like a cute bundle of energy that s for sure
his little nose spots grew falls over it s too cute
those beautiful differently colored eyes it s rare to see and delight every time
his eyes look extremely aesthetic thanks to the heterochromia
this is so cute lol i can‚Äôt imagine being a teacher i think it would be fun but if you see kiddos who have been wearing the same clothes all week or with bruises or who seem sad or hungry ugh i think it would wear away at my spirit and soul quicker than i would like when done right they are the strongest of us all
first i was like wtf girls get hug and boys get high five but then i realised that everybody can choose i like this
my pre k teacher did this i alwased ordered the bonecrusher and i m now a freshmen in highschool she moved into my neighborhood about a month from when i m moving out of my neighborhood i walked to her house and ordered a bonecrusher and that was fun
my son‚Äôs class does that but sometimes a student or two is the one who does the greeting instead of the teacher
before the internet this leveling of posturing didn‚Äôt exist
i m surprised she s even allowed to touch those kids never mind hugging them i could have used a reassuring hug from some of my teachers when i was a kid good for her
was this an enrichment activity for the bears this looks so cute
ends to soon i love bold bear dance stepping over there
it always astounds me when i see bears stand up on legs because thats like an evolutionary trait that they gained entirely separately from humans
bears walking on their mind legs is one of the greatest things ever
i read a comment on another bear video that big foot sightings must have just been upright bears lol this video further proves this observation
these guys are moon bears ‚ù§Ô∏è they‚Äôre sweet gentle animals who are kept locked in cages so tight they can‚Äôt move ‚Äî at all ‚Äî so people can drain the bile from their livers via a permanently installed port for ‚Äútraditional‚Äù asian medicines it‚Äôs awful but sanctuaries are starting to pop up for them over the years as awareness spreads they‚Äôre amazing and deserve so much better than that
i imagine the other to are in the back sayin fuck it up steve get it yea homie
super cute but i hope they don‚Äôt try to eat it so adorable though
goes from curious walking fur tank to a tiptoeing teddy bear in seconds
mallard ducks are one of my favorite things i think their quacks are one of the cutest sounds that exists
it follows you asking for pets then you pet it then it claims it was not a free service and you get stuck with the bill
i m kinda sad now because i m thinking someone would take advantage of this nice duck and be mean
i used to feed ducks at the local pond this one female would sit at my feet and pull on my pant leg if she thought i wasn t paying enough attention
it‚Äôs not possible to not smile when you see this picture
‚Äúi find that a duck‚Äôs opinion of me is very much influenced over whether or not i have bread ‚Äù mitch hedberg
when you have a bunch of parts left over from like other animals
this is my favorite wild animal thanks for the cuteness ü•∞
you can t tell me this isn t a zebra hyena moose cat
zfrank would probably say this is what happens when a moose and a zebra have a baebae
i m betting they keep the cows and zebras separated since this guy was born
yisss i remember when i first heard of these guys i had to do a report on them in the th grade and draw a life size okapi because my class was building a rainforest in the classroom inside a great big blowup dome it was awesome and i became obsessed with the okapi i still keep tabs on them
awww she was meant to find you as her earth angel üòá
did she find out what was making that peculiar noise
can i ask what where u live if its in western australia ill happy give her a home
she‚Äôs beautiful please find someone worthy of her if you can‚Äôt care for her thank you for helping this sweet baby
please give them pets and tell them im proud of them
cute pupper as for being accident free for hours he s got me beat source i am old guy
yay when my dobie finally made it hrs without an accident i cried tears of joy
my year old doberman has had two accidents of the crashing into trees kind in the past three days he‚Äôs stupid but lovely
keep it consistent my second puppy is now months old and is fully trained the key is to not even allow an accident to happen every hours
house training that breed is almost effortless had a dobey as well and he took to it lightning quick
aw i‚Äôm so proud i wish my dobie had been that accident free at even weeks
good boy i know it s hard to control that tiny little bladder
i‚Äôm so proud of them please give the good treats and some next level pets i feel they‚Äôre more than warranted at this point
puppies are more challenging than human babies in many ways make sure the puppy feels safe and secure with you they want to please you and make you happy but they don t understand what it is that you want be forgiving and give lots of praise
aren t dogs meant to stay with the mother for the first weeks
he‚Äôs doing better then my year old shih tzu he‚Äôs having a bad weekend
teach me my month old piitt mix shit in the sunroom for the th day in a row today
it s gonna get to the point where the guy is going to have accidents die to old age my baby boy is almost and there s sometimes when he can t hold it anymore more it s like once every few months but or even rarer but it happens he feels bad about it though you can tell i guess i m saying treasure the moments when you don t have to clean pee off your floor anymore cause they come back
yeah everything this pup did over the last hrs was entirely deliberate
i have month dobby mix and she is so scared of everything that she didn t have any accidents at all goodest girl
good luck and pasta based products will come to you if you say ‚Äúnibble well spaghetti rat‚Äù
thank you for taking care of such a sweet little thing
skettis and a face massage anybody would be happy with that situation he is adorable
the opening to eureka s castle from nickelodeon was my first thought
awwwww i don‚Äôt see why people are afraid of these little cuties
if someone pushed on my face while i was chewing i would probably bite the insides of my cheeks thats a risky game shes playing there
why can i not understand what i‚Äôm looking at on the left of the screen arm leg shoulder
the cat thinking to themselves probably don t eat the bird dont eat the bird
cute pick but those looks like ducks at a duck farm
don‚Äôt know how that cat could take a nap with all the chirping going on gives a new definition to ‚Äòcatnap‚Äô
here we see the lesser spotted patient lazy killer wait for the sick ones to die he knows if he eats the chicken he won‚Äôt get any chicken that night also there‚Äôs for certain so many dead little chicks in and around that area that the cat has it‚Äôs fill anyway
i scrolled past this so fast it looked like kraft macaroni and cheese
this aint cute that place is way too crowded for these poor ducklings
"grooven on a sunday afternoon üé∂üéµgroooven couldn‚Äôt get away to so oonüéµüéµ
i guess you sayüé∂ what what could make me fe el this wayüéµüé∂üé∂ my chick my chicküé∂üéµ üê•üê•üê•üê£"
i worked on a chicken farm a long time ago it was a terrible experience i had to walk through places this crowded trying my best not to step on chicks while picking up the dead ones and putting them in a bucket
that looks like a very ugly place for the baby bucks indeed
i love bees but i can‚Äôt say id want one of the big fat ones landing on me but i could watch them all day
this looks like it could be from bee movie or something
bumble bees are curious and fairly docile they will only sting if they feel threatened or need to protect the hive
beautiful post so wonderful there are still in the wild somewhere
it‚Äôs cute and all but filming while driving a truck in a two way residential street
this is so cool now i m sure some of you figured this out already but the parrot is not being friendly it s actually just using the truck just like dolphins ride a boat s bow wake so that they don t have to work as hard this parrot is riding the trucks turbulence so it can glide along with minimal effort
if it is every day i would like to see a video of the bird showing up every day for a week for example otherwise it is just his bird and travels with him still cool
cool video but i couldn t help but cringe at him operating such a massive vehicle while also filming and interacting with the bird in a densely populated area
i fucking love parrots source i ve had a macaw just like this amp mexican double yellowheads
looks like italy to me macaws arent native to italy its probably his
that bird really needs to stop hanging out with contraction workers all he does is catcall
i read it as greets his truck driver every day and thought that s so sweet
oh fuck off with these animal does this every day titles
how does he know it‚Äôs the same one don‚Äôt they all look like
i feel like the bird was trying to take him on an epic side quest
i‚Äôm drunk and i read that as ‚Äútim mcgraw meets this truck driver every day‚Äù
almost years ago i was riding my motorcycle down a residential street when a pigeon showed up head high and keeping pace i stopped at a stop sign and turned around and went back where i d come from same thing in that it kept pace head high turned around again same thing i did this maybe times total and that pigeon stuck with me through all of them i had to get to work so made a turn off the street and that was that amazing
god i wish i could have a friend like that to look forward to
this happened to me but it was a dove no clue why i would stop the car and it would land on the hood then start driving and it would follow me outside the window it lost me when i got up to mph
could be a reincarnated love saying hello it‚Äôs just damn cute cringed at filming while driving though
this literally looks like the best job ever an office with a view for sure
the song the town the weather the sky what anime is this
as someone who commutes on a packed nyc subway every day this commute makes me very jealous
so is the driver a disney princess or is the truck given the title
yeah you best keep on driving punk that s it keep on driving keep driving i will rain hellfire from above this is my street i m just gonna escort you here until you leave if you don t well it would be a shame if someone were to miss you
what a wonderful thing to happen every day i get to drive across a bridge every day
wow this makes me wanna disappear to italy to drive small truck deliveries across majestic italian countryside with wild macaws gliding alongside me
you should pet the bird or have some treats ready to feed him he seems to like that song too not so much the whistling
saw this on reddit quite awhile ago if i rememeber the bird is the drivers pet and is trained trusted to fly along
i couldnt believe those people passing on a blind curve
how do we know this is a daily thing and not random
the lyrics are oddly wonderful considering the bird will possibly outlive the truck driver
we used to have beautiful birds like this in north america but we killed them all
cute video a bit dangerous filming while driving tho
i like when he drifts over into the other lane while recording the bird and the oncoming traffic has to swerve to the outside of their lane
i had a pet crow that tried this with my dad dad drove a truck and one day a new route took him by home my crow recognized the truck and tried to fly into the cab window the draft from the truck pulled him down and under the tires best pet i ve ever had
this two minutes was better than a lot of disney movies put together
isn‚Äôt this bird extinct now i remember seeing something about how these went extinct and that they‚Äôre the same birds from that old pixar movie about birds
perhaps he wants to look at himself in the mirror for a while
gotta love animals we re all sharing this experience of life together
excellent choice of music i want to be foreeeever young
how do you know they do this everyday link article please
they do this also with bicycles and motorbikes in brasil they really recognize you
beats the hell out of the same guy on the same corner with the same cardboard sign every day
dude you need to get more sleep minecraft phantoms only appear if you go three nights in a row without sleeping
let s dance in style let s dance for a while heaven can wait we re only watching the skies
it s good that someone was keeping their eyes on the road even if it was a bird when the macaw says watch out and then makes a screeching noise you d better have the brakes covered
wow what an amazing thing to see and everyday that‚Äôs one lucky dude
is it bad that i expected a car going the other way to hit the bird
reincarnation confirmed macaw is a lost friend or relative
oh forever young part of the soundtrack of my youth
my bird thought the macaw was talking to him now hes calling out and he s not answering üò¢
the macaw enjoys distracting drivers to see how many head on accidents he can cause he s up to so far
a few dead children would be very befitting ending making a video while driving a truck i rural area seems like wonderful idea
is that a self drive tesla truck because he doesn‚Äôt seem to be paying attention at all to the road
upvoted for alphaville i had this on original cassette
i like this but maybe someone else than the driver should be filming no
when the camera wasnt pointing the in the direction he was travelling it was making me nervous expecting it to pan forward again and there be something in the road or the truck has strayed to the wrong side of the road and there be a horrific accident years of internet has jaded me
this has to be one of the greatest videos of the year so unreal so disney but with less bullshit love it
i m just scared the bird might die of a car going the other way
now please excuse me while i listen to forever young
thats fucking awesome holy fuck what a smart boyyyyy üò≠
wish he was paying more attention to driving than filming his bird
not enough people noticing this fucktard filming and driving a damn truck at the same time
crazy this is exactly what happens to me whenever i‚Äôm blaring this exact song on i nyc only it‚Äôs a dirty pigeon that flies alongside my window and usually i‚Äôm just yelling at it to go away i‚Äôd film it and all but the potholes make it impossible to film anything steadily plus the traffic cameras are everywhere got a ticket for running a yellow last month can only imagine what they‚Äôd send me if i got caught filming frankie the dirty pigeon following me down the highway panhandling for some crumbs and ignoring my threats
had to check this was awwww whilst watching as half expected another truck bus coming in the other direction reddit is a tightrope sometimes
can t be the only that started singing the song at the same time
human ola frankie why do you keep greeting me everyday frankie the bird hey can t deny the perks i get to hitchhike everyday and save me from some heat and energy also i get to listen to good music and train the human how to whistle better
here s what he is saying hi frank hi are we going to work mutiple ciaos fly fly frankie
i ve seen them only on tv but they re an amazing sight
never in my life would i have expected to see a crab climbing a ladder
honey i know what it looks like but i swear to god i got crabs from driving under the bridge
ü¶Äü¶Äjagex is powerless against these spawning crabsü¶Äü¶Ä
i had these once super hard to get rid of them oh and the itching
it s occurred to me that i never thought of a crab climbing a ladder sideways to get across a bridge over a road
imagine that collapsing while you‚Äôre under it and it starts raining crabs
they‚Äôre going to the island to make a bigger crab rave
serious question how do the crabs know they have to climb up
couldnt they just have put in a culvert to let them go under the street vs this bridge thing
christmas island they have shampoos to help deal with these little guys
this could have been done so much cheaper with an electric hp motor driving a platter like a large record player with dividers on it like spokes run it slow like rpm tilted at an angle this would totally work
is it just me the camera angle or is that climb nearly vertical why not make it a less severe angle
i read as five mile high and i was awestruck then i realized that i am dumb
friend of mine in college had something like that going on in his underwear
please tell me you have crab race playing nonstop on these overpasses
wouldn t it have been easier to bore under the road and put concrete pipes in so the crabs could just walk on through
chris bray s a christmas island local isnt he a world famous nature photographer who settled there specifically because of the abundance of natural wonders
this is great but i feel like a pipe laid under the road would be easier
for the raptor with a discerning palate i recommend christmas island as a fantastic getaway from the everyday food moves along to you and humans have built a dining facility clear of the roadway well worth the flight ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è
i love him he looks like the pink version of toothless those giant eyes ughhhh
looks like a funko pop doll so cute named after the aztec god of death
this is way closer to what i expected see monkeys to look like wtf
i ve seen a baby axolotl and now i can die complete
a x o l o t l my time has come to burn i invoke the ancient power that i may return
baby axolotls look like what i always dreamed my sea monkeys would become
aaaaaaah oh god he so smol i wanna pat it on it s smol head
whenever i am sad i shall remember this and be happy
don‚Äôt look into its eyes it might take over your body
oh my fucking god i fucking love it aaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh

a x o l o t l my time has come to burn i envoke the ancient power that i may returnÔªø
is it safe to handle them this young i m asking because i see all these non mammal babies and i have flashbacks to when i found a tiny baby gecko and the poor thing seemed to have had a heart attack and died right there in my palm
it‚Äôs interesting how it‚Äôs not terrified by a giant monster staring at him tapping at his home with his teeth showing
technically speaking all axolotls are babies since it s a salamander who for reasons i can t recall never metamorphoses into an adult
fun fact axolotls remain babies their whole lives never losing their larval gills
for some reason i am thinking of a yellow triangle named bill wonder why
‚Äúi shall call him squishy and he shall be mine and he shall be my squishy come on squishy come on little squishy ‚Äù
til in japan these creatures are known as woopalpers or „Ç¶„Éº„Éë„Éº„É´„Éº„Éë„Éº so close to umpah loompah
they missed a real opportunity when the juvenile name for an axolotl was not made axolitl amp x b same with ocelittles
kawai desu ne it even brought my inner weeb back from the previous decade lol
i just love his hands i cannot get over the hands i want hands like that
i love seeing these animals my gf has six fully grown ones in a giant tank another one has survived the latest litter right word and she is trying to raise him it s sad that hundreds of eggs can hatch at one time and only one or two will survive
how smart are these things like can they recognize people
this is officially the cutest thing i have ever seen
this is actually film of aqa developing the gcse biology paper
very cute but you know all axolotls are babies it s like saying this a cute baby baby
put him in some low oxygen concentrated water for a laugh to see if aqa was telling the truth or not
we are all unworthy of seeing such a pure innocent and adorable creature
yeah he s good and all until one has a fucking biology paper
damn i don‚Äôt know about you but if i was that keeper i would have shat my pants
it loses more frames with every repost will be a jpeg before the year is out
the difference between that and having your face eaten off is extremely small
while this is adorable i m just wondering how many accidental scratches the keeper got because yeah retractable claws but shit happens my cat accidentally gets me all the time when she s getting out from under the covers and it s never enough to leave a mark just to feel that there was claw there but i bet it would be a lot worse if she were leopard size
thank goodness leopard likes her i shudder imagining the reaction if it was going after prey
little leopard is learning from a professional to use claws teeth etc
very similar to his reaction to his least favorite zookeeper but with a slightly different ending
dang if that leopard decided that she was prey instead of the fav the keeper would have been dead lt sec after the leopard began moving
she used to be his third favorite then his second and now
the best display of animal to human affection i have ever seen
i ve seen this so many timed but it never fails to put a smile on my face and my finger up votes immediately
it s crazy that it s claws didn t automatically extend when it s trying to climb up her
they should initiate new zoo keepers this way hey charles go down there and garden a bit in the leopard cage cue favorite zoo keeper showing up on top of the leopard house
this is your daily reminder that big cats are still cats
jealous wish i could experience the excitement cuddle
why does she take off her hair tie towards the end isn t it more convenient to handle a bundle of energy with her hair tied
looks like the panther was even trying to stand on her shoulders like any regular non human murder capable kitty would do
when my mom comes from the store with a bunch of bags
and the winner of this year s parkour grand championship goes to
to be honest that reaction could also have been the least favourite
ppl are so emotional that animal could fkn you up on accident
awwww she s my favourite zoo keeper too can i jump her like that too
i love mulberries they are packed full of iron and my kids are none the wiser about it
i used to pick black berries when i lived in washington at the apartments next to urs when i was a kids and mulberries
so good haha i was sent to work at a nursery when i was in middle school for getting a b lol needless to say after watering the plants i would pull the fruit from both types of mulberry‚Äôs they‚Äôre soooo good
if you eat too many you will have a craving for some colorful rocks
grew up with a mulberries tree in front of the house
it s not even summer if you have mulberries right now they aren t actually mulberries those are an alien species and maybe burn your orchard amp x b no really mulberries and i don t care where you are in the us are not in season amp x b it s fucking may not september don t eat those berries
don t get the juice on your clothes that shit never comes out and pies made from them never last
at a glance i thought this was a really good painting üò±
hello human i hope you stay in my lands is enjoyable
before i clicked i though this was gonna be some minecraft stuff lol
‚Ä¶you never standoff with someone they nickname revolver
no it looks like it wants me to give it fish so i can tame it
something something khajit reference something something
when our dog does this we say she is casting a spell on us
it s been hours already but this baby ocelot is unrelenting i feel my eyes forming crusts must not give in
this on the front page the official mark that it s been another week
tried to win the staring contest but my eyes gloss a lot
you prance with the beasts who parade every night and silently slouch through the forest by light don t be the only one left on the block come hide in the herd and float with the flock
i know salvador dali had one of these as a pet does anyone know what these animals are like as a pet
i think revolver ocelot from metal gear solid series whenever i see the word ocelot
alrighty then but i‚Äôll have you know that he doesn‚Äôt even have a chance at win crap i blinked
i thought the word ocelot was made up and was only to name the dude from metal gear solid later i become and adult and realize it was an actual creature
don t blink don t even blink blink and you re dead they are fast faster than you can believe don t turn your back don t look away and don t blink good luck
do you want archer references because that s how you get archer references
clearly the photographer of this piece was crouching with raw fish in his hand
ok but you gotta get like a tire swing or something in there for him
how do you titillate and ocelot you oscillate it‚Äôs tit a lot
not an ocelot it s a margay cat and this image is so old it s in the default avatar gallery on some websites
ocelot was p yowling oh dear i m bored better go and have a bath i suppose
how do you titillate an ocelot you oscillate it‚Äôs tits a lot
kitteh if i can t have your soul i will settle for biting off a piece of your ass
looks extremely sinister for that reason i don‚Äôt like it at all and i love cats but def pass on this one
this has been my boyfriends wallpaper for the past year or so
i don‚Äôt know who‚Äôs winning him or my cat he came up and is know staring at my phone it‚Äôs hard to type
ignorant slaves finally taken notice have you of the power of my beloved ocelotte child of dragons
if i‚Äôve learned anything from my siamese tomcat it‚Äôs that i must not lock eyes with him for more than a moment any longer than that is apparently interpreted by him as a big ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù and is therefore an invitation for an ass kicking he‚Äôs bloodied my face more than once due to my locking eyes with him these days i try to avoid prolonged eye contact with him at all costs
is it rude to say this would be better with sound lol
in elementary school we had a janitor in his mid ‚Äôs from guatemala i still run into him to this day one of the greatest humans i‚Äôve ever had the pleasure of meeting
literally happy tears so nice thanks for posting this beautiful gem
i felt really immersed when i tried to turn up the volume but didnt hear anything
warms my heart janitors and custodians are underappreciated
custodians are people too appreciate your custodian give them a smile next time you pass them in the hall
i would ask for sound but i don t know if that s appropriate
everyone asking for sound just enjoy it from his perspective
these are the kinds of posts i come to reddit for cries
i still remember my custodian from kindergarten it s easy to think these kids will forget him but in reality he might always hold a spot in their childhood memories i was actually quite a bit saddened when i found my elementary custodian s obituary when i was
oh my god it shows u how fortunate u really are in life great
awww that s so wholesome i love it sorta makes sense that the video has no sound haha
happy birthday mr nice guy how sweet you must be very special
every time i see this video it makes me happy everyone should take time out of their day everyday to do something small that‚Äôll bring a smile to someone‚Äôs face
even though i ve seen this a thousand times it s just so nice to not see people being total shit bags to each other
that made me cry happy tears i have a few deaf family members and this is so wholesome and amazing
there was a deaf custodian at the school where i used to teach we were fans of the same basketball team and used to have long conversations on the blackboard
my father was a school bus driver and then custodian for the school district for years he forged relationships with those kids the dance way teachers would they surprised hin with a little psu when he retired he will see them now as grown ups grin time to time and they sulk recognize him and are happy to see him
i tried turning up the volume then hit my mute button thinking my sound was off

the janitor on the school my gf works as a teacher is basically ‚Äúthe boss‚Äù of the school for all the kids the funny thing is he is a real estate owner aswell which all the parents probably don‚Äôt know and does not n√©√©d to work as a janitor this always makes me smile and lighten up
janitor at my sons school was is beloved by everyone over the course of years we spent at least dollars a year making sure we recognized and honored his hard work during the holidays and we were just one of many families to do so
i‚Äôve seen this x on this site i get choked up and teary every single time
i miss my schools janitor one of the men i have really taken as example of being like later
everyone loves our school s maintenance guys one of them did a talk to us once and that man s been through some shit i tell you what
on wednesday i was driving to starbucks with my coworkers during a long hour day i had to hit my breaks for a squirrel in the road when it started to run we realized it was a kitten i threw on my hazards and ran in to the road a cop was driving right behind me so he helped me stop traffic and chase her down she was terrified and darting all around i finally grabbed her and immediately fell in love i‚Äôm not sure if i‚Äôm going to be allowed to keep her yet but i sure hope so

i have tried teaching my dog this she doesn t seem to get it even after i put her feet on the bottom and show her that she can stand she still just doesn t seem to believe it
there s a theory that humans started evolving into bipedals by foraging in shallow waters give this boy a million years and who know what happens
dobermans are such beautiful and friendly dogs but i never see them around anymore this one is clearly some kind of mutant sea otter
what country is this it s illegal to cut dogs ears for aesthetic purposes where i live not judging i just assumed it was like that in all st world countries
nothing better than watching a girl holding a peaceful ass
for a second there i thought she had her fingers in her ass
if you look closely there s a little pussy hiding too
the donkeys in africa and asia smell this one probably smells like flowers
wait i heard about these vids from the nd jay and silent bobs
if his name isn‚Äôt one eyed willie then i am disappointed
if you gave him an eye patch he d look like that character buck from ice age dawn of the dinosaurs
can someone explain what s up with one eyed animals everywhere around here is it your new kinky fetish or an attempt of bruteforcing some kind of awareness again
what u dont know is he pooped in the bedroom which he doesnt know was the outside backyard pirate doggos have no shame
the cat equivalent of scrooge mcduck swimming in his money vault
i have an orange kitty and ican tell you this is a one way ticket to barf city but it s cute af
the only thing better than a big bowl of chow is a big bowl of catnip d
this is like if you filled a kiddie pool up with cheez its
and later when i licked myself clean i tasted great
me after a trip to the store to restock on junkfood
the thumbnail looked vaguely like a roast chicken on macadamias that i had to look my complaint it they overloaded his brain with happiness
so this is how simba got so big in minutes of screen time
do cats enjoy cat food or merely tolerate it i always wondered
this kitten will spend the rest of its life dreaming of this moment and wondering if it really happened
david hasselhoff made a similar video this one is way cuter
i should get a giant bowl and do this for my adult cat
why didnt the astronaut come home to his wife he needed some space get it space because astronauts go to space
i have large dogs my niece asked me to watch her cat for her said her cat loved dogs what she didn t mention was how much her little kitty loved dog food
this is literally me every holiday dinner with my family
first you get the kibble then you get the catnip then you get the power
this looked like really good latte art from the thumbnail
do cats have the same lack of impulse control dogs have when it comes to food will they also just keep eating until they re sick
i know the feeling too cat just going into my cat food that i am about to eat disrespectful
i know cats are pros at fitting in small places but something tells me he she won t always fit into that bowl
i know its wrong for me to say but is this uncooked might need to work on that i kid of course still cute kitten xd
this makes me happy and sad at the same time i just recently lost my cat and this baby one makes me think about her
it s like the scrooge mc duck thing but food instead of gold coins
this is like scrooge in duck tales swimming in his gold
watch out kitten we want to keep you a healthy weight better hit your running wheel or do some zoomies
soon after he later starts grooming himself strangely he notices cats taste like catfood weeks pass he can t get the thought out of his head not long after cats in the neighbourhood start to go missing this is how cannibal cat came to be
being that s cats gotta be wild like imagine if someone made you a kiddie pool of chicken fried rice
i slayed a giant afterwards i climbed into bed with his wife when she woke up she thought i was her baby fed me giant bowls of food for months thats how i got so big northern dude
my tuxedo cat literally jumped in the food container
this is how i see humans who ve suddenly got a lot of money
this kitty is living my dream just switch cat food with human food lol
i‚Äôd like to do that in a giant bowl of cinnamon toast crunch
i see that leonardo da vinci thing where the man is in a couple of axes
in his mind he s rolling around in a shredded gazelle
i can t be the only one that looked quickly at the caption and the photo and thought that the cat was being cooked a small cat so much food
remind me in years when he s a big orange bruiser i had a pure orange tabby like one of the bestest chill cats i ever had and i ve had a lot and man could he purr all night long even through his sleep right through til dawn we were building a gi ga normic house deep in the woods and the little bugger came wandering out weeks maybe barely months with fleas and ticks shivering in the misty cold april morn i curled him up in a spare sweatshirt in a box on the passenger floor of my truck and ran the heat minutes at a time directly on his head his little motor was purring at the roach coach arrived and i procured a tuna fish sandwich from which i made a protein rich slurry he did lap up til his belly was round and full then he tried to clean himself but he just passed out into sleep still purring lunch was the same and he slept on my lap all the way home keeping up with the purring i remember fondly how his tiny self fit in the palm of my hand when i washed him in the basement slop sink mild shampoo and fine tooth comb and when being dried he stuck his little hind leg up out of the towel while licking it and yup purring the whole way thru now one of the guys a young swedish fellow had said maybe his girlfriend could give it a home then the next day he said he asked and she said no but i cut him off saying that s ok i m keeping him we were sitting on a load of wood by the driveway taking braak when one of the guys asked what was i naming him i looked over his shoulder and saw the sheet of plywood tacked to the tree spray painted with lot and so it was it was to be no lie that cat was with me for years seen a lot watched me go through much including the divorce leaving just me and him now that the two others were already gone when it was his time the day before thanksgiving in a light rain falling i left work early took him to the vet then back to the job as darkness fell and laid him down feet deep in a thick patch of woods at the property line bordering a rolling cemetery where through the months before i watched deer and fox and pheasant to name a few what better place to release his spirit among the spirits of all other creatures i drove home in a melancholy way wet muddy and slightly chilled and stood in the shower for nearly an hour not wanting be in my house so totally alone which is exactly how thanksgiving passed on the couch with the remote and a bowl of spaghetti about a month later on the job late and dark and just leaving i glanced for an instant the shadow of a cat sitting next to the dumpster looking my way and when i looked back i saw it turn then not run but just vanish lot did come back one more time to say goodbye to me
this looks like the people equivalent of laying in a huge pile of money
is he trying to eat as if he s suckling from his mother poor lil guy grow up kid
i d like to try that with a plastic kiddie pool full of peanut butter cap n crunch
i like to imagine the human equivalent would be an inflatable pool filled with mcnuggets
me when i m staying at my brother s house i go out drinking and come back drunk to a casserole his wife just made and they are asleep
if i could lay in my food like this and eat it i totally fucking would no shame
the food cat this will never not get likes lt lt lt
this kitten is living the human dream of being in a pool of your favorite food
that s me when my bf brings me white chocolate buttons xd
serious question is there any particular reason many animals lay on their food
i had a cat almost exactly like this who would do the exact same thing we named him stingy
demi moore rolling in money in indecent proposal comes to mind
gt teddy has a condition called cerebellar hypoplasia chch ssome people call it wobbly cat basically his cerebellum stopped forming in utero because his mom was exposed to distemper depending on when the mom is exposed depends on how severe the ch is teddy‚Äôs condition is pretty severe he‚Äôs still trying to learn to walk and stay upright we want him to be able to eat in between the three ‚Äúkitten‚Äù meals that we give him throughout the day so we discovered by placing him in the kibble food bowl he‚Äôd just chow down until he‚Äôs full he really enjoys it
reminds me of scrooge mcduck relaxing in the money bin
whenever i see things like this i always imagine what the human equivalent would be like could you imagine just lounging in a giant bowl of mashed potatoes and taking a bite every now and then from the surrounding mashed potato chair you made lmao that would be heaven
anyone else have a sudden urge to fill a bathtub with cheerios
this reminds me of bart simpson dreaming about swimming in slushy syrup and then doing it and getting sick
this is pretty much what i imagine a lot before falling asleep
that‚Äôs very cute can‚Äôt tell who is enjoying it more with that nature ex house pet maybe i‚Äôve tried to approach a true feral before it tried to kill me
i hate to be the one to tell you this he isn t your boyfriend any more
you can tell when it hits the ‚Äúalmost too much‚Äù point for your boyfriend it‚Äôs hilarious adorable
thanks for not confusing street cat with feral cat like way too many of the folks on this sub do
former boyfriend so sorry op relationships can be rough
this is so cute i can‚Äôt handle it now i miss my cat so much so much cute all around
i love that his face is basically saying well this is my life now
wait do you by any chance live in ohio wife s grandparents have some outdoor cats and she had one like this who loved giving kisses and hugs either way enjoy your new overlord
streetcat named desire is such a good name i nearly sure she whispered shit about you when your not there
is he related to travis willingham he kinda looks like him
i just got a foster that is doing this i don t know what i am going to do
this is exactly how my cat is to me and my husband gets so salty about it
i have a feeling something is going to happen to that cat next week
that s not your boyfriend anymore hahaha he is taken üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ that s so beautiful ‚ù§Ô∏è
"just my ex boyfriend and the street cat
ftfy
jokes aside i awwwwwed so loud at this lt"
my nd rescue who was the one we lept from a litter will get on my chest when i m on the couch and start petting my beard i love my four legged bro
this should be labeled nsfw with all that loving that s going on on screen lmao
i love how your boyfriend let the cat steer the affection train this is so darling
i hate to be the one to tell you this he isn t your boyfriend any more
now you may think this is your boyfriend but the cat doesn t think so it looks like he s the cat s boyfriend now
many cats use social grooming with those that are trusted for cleaning their faces and heads i wonder if the cat is waiting his turn like come on man my turn ugh okay a little more for you now fine here s a little more for you
i read this is ‚Äúmy boyfriend and streetcat that i rescued‚Äù lol
meant to be make sure that house plant isn‚Äôt toxic to cats
you taste just as good as the last meal owner i had
cats typically love stubble its like getting brush feels really good to them
that‚Äôs extremely trusting of humans for a street cat may have been a house cat at some point
shirtless with a cat on your chest that s a brave man
my big boy is a former street cat and somehow found his way to a no kill shelter he picked me out and now owns me that s what cats do
the kitten on your face we will raise it as our own
if that cat is a girl please name it desire so it s a street cat named desire
that s a jacked version of adam sandler this is backstage unseen footage of dont mess with zohan
cats love beards man my gfs cats love rubbing up against my beard it feels very special lol
that pussy was all over that man sorry i‚Äôm just going to go ahead and leave
my brothers cat does this absolutely loves beards i love her little rubs i‚Äôll lay there for hours with her like this
‚Äúi don‚Äôt care if you give me ringworm i love you too kitty ‚Äù
i love your bf there aren t many men like that ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°
my cat was really in bad shape when i got him off the street he bites me all the damned time
i wonder if it is a street cat thing my husbands cat was a stray rescue too and she does this to him too
just an fyi you should give that cat a flea bath asap if you ve brought it into your home
now he can t ever shave his beard it belongs to the cat
dude my cat does this all the time at first you‚Äôre like oh that‚Äôs cute then you start to think where has the cat‚Äôs tongue been now she just headbutts my chin to get scritches
that can be bad after he adjusts to cans of wet food and has chronic feline halitosis
legitimate question why do stray cats bond to humans so easily i mean i know not all of them do but i remember finding a few cats once that wouldn t leave my side the moment they saw me i assume they wanted food but i never fed them and they would keep coming around my house to hang out with me
what a sweet sweet kitty tell him thanks for saving her oh the love
with all respect i ve never wanted to be cat so much in my life
my cat does this if anyone touches me she has to rub her scent on my to get theirs off she s a bit obsessed but i love her
so sweet i think this guy is husband material right here
hey op wife him up anyone that s kind to animals is a good person in my book inb someone shows a picture of hitler petting animals or someshit
oh yeah my cat the exact same thing loves licking my beard and hair lol
omg this is heart melting kitty looks so comfortable and happy my cat will ‚Äúgroom‚Äù my oldest son son is cat is he will follow him to his bed and lick my sons hair until he falls asleep then he sleeps beside him i wonder why cats do this he doesn‚Äôt do it to anyone else except him it‚Äôs so sweet
op i am sorry you have lost this boyfriend i would not recommend fighting with a street cat he is the cat s now
my daughter snuck a kitten into our house she‚Äôs a spayed cat now but she does that to me constantly
my cat does this and then he bites me in the face i think it is supposed to be a love bite but it still hurts this is adorable and so cute
oh my goodness that cat appreciates the heck what he did and loves loves loves him as a result
it s cute but i need to be the one to say of the comments here are cat stole your boyfriend
face licking is a sign of dominance the cat owns the man
this is something my sweet boys friend would do too
very glad to know i‚Äôm not the only one who makes that face when my cat licks my beard hahahaha
where do people find these loving cats my brother s cat will let me pet her for seconds and then immediately starts biting and clawing my hand off
my rescue cat looks just like yours and does the same thing to me
why do birds suddenly appear every time that you‚Äôre near
you can see it in his face he s gonna get that cat to lick sardine juice off his taint
i think that cat is trying to take your place you are in danger
i recently like around october had my cat roy go missing and this one looks so much the same to my cat that it just retches my heart to watch this i just hope wherever you are you are happy roy ‚ô•Ô∏è
uff holding a cat without a shirt living on the fucking edge
i saw then stroked this wild cat while waiting for a friend to come out a casino my friend and i then walked across a roundabout up a hill then after km i noticed a meow sound turned around and saw the cat namika hiding under a car looking directly at me i waved at her and kept walking after km more we all arrived at my house my friend waited outside with her while i got some tuna then fed her all the way into my house she s so loving but only shows it when i sleep she is a adorable little kitty
looks like you‚Äôve got some competition there of course you do realize you‚Äôre not anymore right fyi i clean the litter box everyday brush ziggy feed her amp pet her but when my husband walks in the door she treats me like the hired help and thinks the sun shines out his ass and he doesn‚Äôt do anything
mad lad that he didn‚Äôt have his shirt on cause if he she pull out the claws then your gonna get some scars
can your boyfriend rescue me in all seriousness how adorable all of my pets have been street rescues and i‚Äôve never had a single regret
i love how big your bf is btw i kinda wish i was that cat
how drunk was the cat or you when you found each other
are you sure that he is your boyfriend i don t believe the cat would agree
how did you know this car was the one was it shy at first or did it immediately come up to you in the cage i went to shelters today looking for this type of affection but decided to think things over
why does your boyfriend look like a younger adam sandler
street cats love so aggressively sometimes i gotta let them take the lead lmao
you should get him one of those cat brushes shaped like a tongue that he can hold in his teeth
five minutes before this video was taken the cat was licking his own asshole
looks like that cat is trying to move in on your man
that‚Äôs so weird the street cat i rescued does the exact same thing
that cat claimed your boyfriend now he s your ex jokes aside this is super wholesome
tell your bf that the guns he‚Äôs carrying are illegal no but seriously can you ask him what kind of exercises he does to get those big arms
who rescued who again it looks like the cat is the one taking care of your boyfriend not the other way around
your boyfriend appears to be a fat stoned scott auckerman
i rescued my henry as an adult street cat and he licks the hell out of me too i ve had other cats i raised from kittens and none of them did this it can get annoying but i still love him
i trust you re planning to husband this man as a result of this adorableness üòç
great video rescue spay and neuter people not your boyfriend
anyone know what kind of breed this is this cat looks exactly like one of my cats except mine is really fat lbs even though he eats less than the other cats and is healthy i ve looked at ragamuffins and norwegian forest cats and a lot of other ones but nothing has ever come close he s my baby and a cuddle bug when he was a kitten he used to climb up on my shoulders and fall asleep there he s always been my just wants to be held and cuddled with anytime anywhere kitty he can t really jump or meow either
so sweet thank your bf for being a beautiful human being
i rescued a stray last summer he was exactly like this the first month or so now the little shit won‚Äôt even let me pet him still love him though
my cat does the same thing it starts to hurt after the third lick cheetahs can make your skin bleed with one lick apparantly from what i heard
i feel i have never been loved as this cat loves this man adorable
looks quite dirty and the cat could use a bath as well
another strong reason for having facial hair i know i have despite few folks trying to talk me out of it damn naysayers
fun fact did you know that cats show a preference to guys with beards and will often shove their faces into there chins
i cant live without animals such a furry cutie the cat im already stocked up on husband lt
he seems like he might have started his life as a house cat
yep my molly is like this very persistant in her thanks she was from a cat rescue place
street cat s aint that friendly he s been a pet somewhere along the line
some cats have really rough tongue but you just can t push them away x
at first i thought the title said ‚Äújust a boyfriend a street cat and i rescued‚Äù
i often wonder how many redditors just steal peoples outdoors cats
reminds me of the australian woman who went to the philippines and rescued a cat and got rabies she died when it was too late
oh my gosh this makes my heart so happy she‚Äôs clearly so grateful what a sweet kitty you guys got
don t know whos the cuttest the cat or the boyfriend
riffraff street cat i don t buy that look a little closer
your fella is a keeper he is so sweet and gentle hell i want to date him
this is so adorable his side profile looked a bit like a younger adam sandler and nick jonas

i didn‚Äôt know chris d‚Äôelia had a cat happy birthday üéÅüéÇüéàüéâüéä
he looks much older you must be a proud dad how old is that cat he looks pretty old to
‚Äúhab birfday‚Äù my friend group when we celebrate an animal birthday
it cracks me up how old cats start to resemble old men dogs just get gray and a little droopy cat faces start to look more like people faces
happybirthday hope that you live the rest of your life with this lovely man im sure he takes good care of you
how was it having eminem sample you on his song with logic
my boyfriend used to have a beautiful black cat that looked just like him bone structure amp everything he‚Äôs beautiful happy birthday good boy

happy birthday to your ancient egyptian god who is taking the form of a cat
you stay up too late either on pc or phone i‚Äôd guess blue light filters like f lux free for pc or a app for phone iphone has a filter for this as well built in will allow you to feel ready for bed earlier and get better rest poor rest leads to a lot of illness and disease over time of left untreated
i guess i wasn‚Äôt the only one who thought the cat was saying the man turned
looks a bit like somebody has been in the catnip again üòè
can t get who is saying that cat or this awful creature on the back hail cats
why are you in the picture this isn t a selfie sub take that shit to instagram ya poser
it‚Äôs clearly been domesticated and i hope someone marks it during hunting season so it doesn‚Äôt get shot adorable though
that is one comfortable deer probably gets fed by humans regularly
deer are so beautiful it is hard to find words what a wonderful friend you made there
seriously do you people want rabies because this is how you get rabies you can enjoy nature without touching it
holy crap it s a deer lol what an amazing experience though that s awesome deer are so breathtakingly beautiful
he‚Äôs clearly casing the place he will be back late tonight to steal that brand new flat screen tv
i heard from hunters that if a human touches baby deer its mom will smell it and leave the babe wont care for the baby anymore idk if its true but mybe thats why hes so familiar with the humans he has to ged food somewhere and survive
isn t it true that when petting a deer the parent will not let the deer back in the group because it has a human scent on it
i hate seeing these things sometimes because dances with wolves scarred me she s probably over a long time developed trust towards human and despite laws people do as they please someone out there would probably dispose of her with no remorse or not a care
you shouldn t touch wildlife it smells like people now and it might be rejected by their family
the only nice thing you can do for that cutie is scare him away if it has no fear of humans it ll run happily to the next hunter and receives a bullet in its brain
i‚Äôm going to need picture updates as harper grows up
someone asked me why she s so smol and it s because shes actually a mini aussie harper will only grow to be maybe lbs at full she was just under lbs when we brought her home at weeks
i wonder if she has any tips on how to kill a mockingbird
pup on the right is judging the human for the vertical video infraction
are these swings designed for dogs they wouldn‚Äôt seem comfortable to set on
the pup on the far right doesn t seem too impressed amp x b this is beautiful
are these the same ones from that video of them on a treadmill
ok how did you do this and how can i get my dog to do this
this is lovely can i ask what breed this is curious
the one on the left is john lennon second to the left is ringo starr third is paul mccartney and fourth is george harrison from the beatles
ommgmgmmggmgmmgmgmgmgnmgnmgngmbhlkjuhg iykguiyhjbn mfd
how i have and year old kids and can t get them to both look at the camera simultaneously sitting down
they‚Äôre gonna catch fire from rubbing their tails like that
hahahaha the second one is better at this sitting a little behind as long as you keep that position it won t stop
i need one of these as a pillow and eventual couch replacement
the way their tails drag on the ground is so dang cute
i used one of those ince and my legs were going so fast it shouldn t of been possible
this has to be fake how the hell can you get not one two or three but four puppies to sit still and on swings nonetheless
i have seen this video a thousand times and it‚Äôs still as good as it was the first
was about to comment on how cute this was then realized it was a gif maximum cuteness
french hens turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree
i ve been very stressed about politics in the states for the last few hours and i came here to be cheered up did not disappoint lt
good boys wagging tails and a doggo begging for treats
the one on the left steve has his tongue out doesn t he glances at steve goddamit steve this is exactly you are never invited to any party stop embarrassing us meanwhile steve blrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrl
on the fourth day of christmas my true love gave to me four swinging dogs three happy cats two booped noses and awesome adorable posts
"from left the right the leader
the dumb best friend
the romantic interest the surly emo girl"
the only one enjoying the swing is the one with its tongue out the rest are questioning why there on swings in the first place
i‚Äôm gonna do this when i‚Äôm old enough to buy my own dogs
would this be in japan the buildings have that look about them for some reason
i think this is a line in a song right after ‚Äúfive golden riiiiings ‚Äù
all of them are my favorite because there all happy to be there and i love dogs
pupetual motion machine receives nobel prize in litterature üèÖ
this is like the third time i ve seen this reposted and ain t even mad these pups just brighten the fuck out me day
are the swings for dogs because i‚Äôm having a hard time seeing how people could use them
the second one with his or her tongue out is too much for me
cat is like yeah i got this model walks by yo get off my stage
"cause i m a model you know what i mean
and i do my little turn on the catwalk"
that model walking by was thinking about how much she‚Äôs sacrificed to get there and the cat was just trying to pick out a spot to sleep
i really need to get to istanbul apparently it s true there are cats everywhere
that cat is walking down the runway like gag bitches
the crowd there was pretty liberal it was a bold choice to wear fur
if i were a journalist taking photos for an article i would definitely keep photos of that little cutie i would even do a bit on what a good model they were
he needs to shed a few pounds if he‚Äôs really serious
if one of the models had picked up the kitty and walked away with her that would be a display of real class
you mean it s destiny don t forget cats were worshiped as gods and never let us forget it
cat embraces its life long dream of being an asshole on the cat walk
this is just a cat being a cat and not giving two shits about it
from the title i must conclude that the cat dies at the end
the fur color looks to fit in with the theme of the show purrfectly
what do you call a cat walking on a ramp a walking pussy
dont even need to practice the catwalk cat is a natural
i hate how seriously fashion shows are taken as if you can t stop to move the cat off the runway how long till boston dynamics are selling runway robots
this is the first step in a well thought out career path inspired by cara delevigne this cat ultimately would like to be known as life long model actress this vid was actually a few years ago and she has been offered a role in the film version of ‚Äòcats‚Äô she has turned it down in january of this year against her agent‚Äôs advice for fear of being typecast her statement appeared at the time but those who can‚Äôt google it read ‚Äòi have challenged the modelling world by first of all being plus sized secondly refusing to shave the natural hair that industry insists models must be rid of and thirdly by you know being a cat whilst i‚Äôm extremely flattered by this offer i don‚Äôt feel it really challenges my acting skills and i‚Äôll take hollywood on my own terms‚Äô powerful she then proceeded to lick her butt
man this weight loss transformation thing that models have to do these days has gotten ridiculous
cat meow darling as she scratches playfully at the model
she like it s my time to shine aaaannd along comes this bitch and steals my spotlight attack
damn you really missed out using on the cat walk somewhere in that title
was veronica corningstone there to cover it for the evening news
in istanbul you can see cats everywhere literally everywhere
i had a dream of becoming a life long astronaut unfortunately they make you retire at a certain age
that cat s the only living thing on that stage who could pass a drug test
lol and the cat models a coat with the same color scheme as the collection
on a catwalk a cat s performance is just called walking
that was certainly some catty behavior trying to grab one of the other models
love that the cat even goes with the color combo the models are wearing
cat embraces its lifelong dream of becoming a model what are you on
this should just have been titles ‚Äúcatwalk‚Äù you fucked up op
whoever posted this was high af when they made the title üòÇ
cat embraces its lifelong dream of becoming a model

that front paw tuck takes his sploot to a whole new level of cuteness
i like to tuck a free hand underneath my wife s pillow she hates it but it s a good feeling
i love corgis to the point that i yell out of my work van if i see one ‚Äùyou‚Äôre a corgi ‚Äù every single time they stop look at me ears perk up and the butt wiggle commencesüòÇ
this dog is my spirit animal that‚Äôs how i sleep lol
i used to do this then my arms started falling asleep lol
when you re that adorable you can sleep however you want plz pass on a belly rub to him from me but not until he s awake also what s his name
he looks sooo comfortable i think i‚Äôm going to start tucking my paws in when i sleep works for him
he s adorable please tell me you have will be getting a cat named milo
i actually had an orange tabby cat named otis when i was a kid lol he was a big boi
i got a kitty named milo i d post him but my account is too young
ah this would be a fantastic lead up to a drama series
so cool lotsa little slices of life seemed complete when after the customers eating and enjoying themselves showed the employees working making it all possible
it shows the subtle difference in culture of japan and north america a north american would question why there is a camera the japanese smile and wave
wonder what would happen if i did that here in the u s
the guy that put the camera on the conveyor is tokyo sam
you could make a great short film in this style if you were clever and talented oh well
and then a bored employee picks up the camera and puts it into the dishwasher
this is so relaxing i love people watching all the possible stories and lives that are so different you got a nice variety of archetypes in there the family meal the high school kids the boys day out the girls day out the office workers the tourists the two best friends the cute couples the music really tops it off i wish this was longer
welp that was nice but you cant do this in america or else someone would have stolen it
that s one of the nicest things i ve ever seen a little glimpse into how different people all in the same place can be
that was awesome everyone has so many plates do they have more than one piece on each how do they eat it all
so many tables here have like sushi plates each if you go for sushi in the uk you get about before you have to start to consider remortgaging your house
i dunno i don t go around tokyo recording random strangers as if they were in a zoo nor would i want cameras zooming in on my face as i ate
anyone know a playlist with music like this calming but upbeat no lyrics
try doing this in america and you‚Äôll be sued by at least three people
i ve been working as a waiter for more than years now and it s crazy how much stuff is simply going on being a very empathic helps me understand the mood and listening usually lets you know the reason why people is out to eat but it s always crazy serving a table where there s a woman crying cause she lost her son then the next one is a table where you need to be very professional and the next again has a bunch of girls just having fun and trying to be the best at every table for every situation feels soul consuming
this is an interesting video but i don t get why it s aww when it s clearly a violation of privacy those people are not some exotic animals it s disrespectful and wrong to film them without their consent
dude basically made a trappin in japan video and it works so fucking well loved the music and the super chill environment loop it and add more tracks
could only work in japan everywhere else that camera would have been whipped away sharpish
has a very fake little story cool effect but staged as all hell
wow i thought anime was only exaggerating the stacked plates
it ended to soon i wanted to see where sushi comes from
saw a video of a corgi swimming it looked like a an otter
major doge to ground control a contact has been made
i like how she accelerates as she gets closer to the water üòÇü§£
i did too by dog i had he died on december but maybe in july augustus new one
just a thought maybe holding a dog like that make it difficult for them to breathe
i had the a space odyssey theme music playing in my head
helicopter landing procedure requesting landing please
"my nam iz dog and wen i feel watr beneeth the fear iz reel i start to swim
befor i touch surfac of wet the air i scratch its just prepare its jus in case so wen i touch
i swimm wiz grace"
the water level in that bath makes me very uncomfortable
cute my pug dave would do this if you held him over a puddle so funny especially since dave couldn t swim at all he also had a very worried look on his face like your dog
let s all take this moment to ridicule people who pronounce doge with a soft g most shiba inus aren t aristocrats and none of them are aristocats the word is a play on dog where the distinction of a hard g is pretty important otherwise it loses purpose altogether
he s a cutie alright are you calling him otto or gunther
awesomely cute i have a female german shepherd that has the same markings as this little cutie autumn had big paws too as a puppy she was weeks old and weighed lbs when we brought her home she was our little chubette she s years old now lbs and she still has big paws i love the breed autumn is my th gsd since
i don t know how to post pictures on this app i would have posted a pic of autumn if i knew how to
this may be the most adorable thing i ve seen all week perhaps even all year
you have knocked it out of the park on cuteness with the bow tie
he looks like a kid dressed up and posed for his school picture
i want to pet this little cute furry lovey thing da piddies
he looks like he‚Äôs about to sheepishly ask if he could please have some ice cream the answer is yes yes you can
a scottish fold is adorable enough that bowtie has completely melted my heart though üòç
between the big eyes and the bowtie it looks like a teddy bear
scottish folds are so cute sadly their breed is prone to many health problems so it‚Äôs best not to to endorse the breeding of them
although they may be cute and adorable the way their ears are folded give them a lot of pain please do not buy them because that encourages breeding thank you
adodrable repost seriously just this month alone i have seen this pic show up times on this sub
i‚Äôll be damned if that isn‚Äôt a stuffed animal omfg is so damn cute it‚Äôs too cute for me to handle
well the reposts are strong with this one but thats a damn cute kitty cat
i need a few of these for my cats prince of purrrsia and makiavelli
very cute cat to anyone considering getting a scottish fold be aware that they develop serious health problems due to their inability to produce certain types of cartilage it can be very expensive to properly care for them and perhaps isn t worth it for everyone
i thought i was still in my saved posts until i saw it was on my front page¬Ø „ÉÑ ¬Ø repost but still cute
alright this is the cutest thing i possibly have ever seen
you better hide that baby scot before tswizzle adopts it haha
i ve always wanted a blue but now i m seriously debating getting a fold
i have two one is adopted from a shelter and obviously overbred he has issues with his joints i got a second one which i paid a small fraction of marker price for because they re amazingly sweet loyal affectionate animals his health is better than the other and i don t regret either acquisition even a bit
i read adorable scottish food and was very confused for a moment there
repost repost repost repost repost repost repost repost repost repost repost repost repost repost repost repost repost repost repost
how many times do i have to fold a cat before it‚Äôs a scottish fold and does it matter with what part of the cat i start
short legs scottish fold has genetic disease stop adopting the kind of cat many short legs scottish fold was born because of you
omg that‚Äôs the exact cat collar i‚Äôve been looking for where did you get it my boy lost his üò≠
i ve seen a lot of cute pictures i think this may be the cutest
not a cat expert is that permanent don t the shape of the ears allow the sound to go through i imagine it would be hard to hear if my ears were folded in
i don‚Äôt know why but he reminds me of gumball from the amazing world of gumball
if i comment on this picture there will be a high pitched squealing noise from the other room sometime early tomorrow morning
i ve seen this posted many times but i can t not up vote this it s just too cute ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
not a cat guy i‚Äôm allergic etc but this is the cutest ducking thing i‚Äôve ever seen
adorable but please don t buy scottish folds from pet stores breeders the reason their ears flop down is due to a lack of cartilage throughout their whole body causing them painful and incurable arthritis
i‚Äôm not a cat person at all but i would be for that one he she‚Äôs beautiful
his eyes is asking something are you my mom where is she save animals save planet
normally i am not one for any clothes on animals but my god that is perfect and adorable

god damn i hate being allergic to cats imagine being allergic to chocolate you re missing out on something billions of other people get to experience just a few months ago i helped a friend go pick up backyard furniture that was given to him from a family friends of his the chairs and ottoman were covered in cat hair he has a scion box car i forgot the model name he closed all the windows and turned the ac on high i seen car hair flying all over the car it was a hot day so i didn t want to am him to roll down the windows minutes later i was home about to watch a movie when suddenly i felt my wind pipe swelling and being coated in mucus i took the most benadryl i ve ever taken in my life and it only made a little difference i have asthma too so i took a treatment of my asthma nebulizer and that helped a lot i later told my mom who is a rn and she freaked out and said i should have gone to the hospital right when i felt my wind pipe being coated in mucus she said she seen many people die who went through the same thing i went through but didn t have an asthma nebulizer man i wish someone will creat a cure for cat dander allergies within my lifetime
my mom used to have a cat when she was it was a scottish fold persian mix named toby topaz muffin face i want one just because of what i‚Äôve heard about toby topaz muffin face scottish folds are so emotional i love it
this cutie is called wally insta handle at wallytheseattlescotty
i‚Äôm not a cat person but there is something about scottish fold kittens that makes me forget all about that
id just like to say that you shouldnt buy scottish folds the risk of one beeing born with osteochondrodysplasia is way too high i have and of them has this it hurts to see him suffer like this
this is wally he has an instagram wallytheseattlescotty almost yr old now
you know he has the cutest lil jellies under those paws
this breed has chronic pain they have constant pain in the articulations should mot be bred anymore
this breed is the only reason i want a cat cartoon level ridiculous cuteness
i misread this thought it said affordable scottish fold took longer than i d like to admit to make sense
as someone who is allergic to cats i can say i would definitely cuddle this cat and i wouldn t care how swollen my face got
this suffering breed needs to be put out of its collective misery
he looks very worried that people won‚Äôt like his bow tie
it‚Äôs cute but people only care about the cute animals chickens get stuffed in cages and grounded up we don‚Äôt care about them because they weren‚Äôt born with being cute humans are dumb
i don‚Äôt care about the breed loook at its little bow tie they think it‚Äôs people
omg what a super cute face such a shame those adorable little cat ears are folded away
please stop buying these cats they re inbred to fuck because they re soooo kawaaaaaii
ahh c mon donkey look at him in his little wee boots
my mom has had scottish folds all very healthy lived long lives one died at and the other two are alive and well year olds
i want this to walk straight into my uterus so i can give it birth was this too much
i adore scottish folds i think they are most adorable of all the breeds
forgive my ignorance but is it a way for a reverse breeding minimize the health problems and maximise the lifespans or the damage is unrepairable
and now you re going to fluff up all the insides of the blankets they ll never get the fur out

that smile the second part of this video shows him shamed and peeking from behind the bench truly an emo pupper has his feelings out on his paws
isn t this the same cloud who dug up that dirt and hid behind that chair and looked gilty
i feel like this cloud needs a poem from that user that always comments with poems for floofs
dude i had a pyr that did this all the time baths were frequent had to keep my happy cloud sparkling clean just so they could roll in some more dirt
yesterday he was hiding behind the bench for digging today he‚Äôs enjoying the fruit of his labor sound asleep and he‚Äôs smiling and wagging his big tail i‚Äôll bet he‚Äôs dreaming about digging in dirt cheers
ah yes the guilty pyrenees ours dug up our garden and then napped in it similar lazy tail wags were had

well we usually see hawks or crows or pigeons this is a treat
i see it and it is really beautiful but i also think what was god thinking when he gave him that beek creative sense of humor least we know where picasso gets it from
i know intellectually that in other places that birds like toucans are just indigenous wildlife but i‚Äôm always kind of surprised by it kind of like how it never occurred to me that fireflies weren‚Äôt normal globally or other critters that seem normal to me armadillos possums snappers and so on anyway animals are cool
suddenly the fugees killing me softly with his song starts playing in the background as he belts out a tiny howl

i ve been saying for a while now that we just misinterpreted it s now meow it s me now
cuz he doesn‚Äôt know if he goes pinot grigio before beer or what
he s playing fucking monopoly and probably beating your ass at it
he may not know what he is doing but he is trying his best for real why make doggo banker
i love him he gets all my pats and all my properties
well obviously anybody who puts money in the center of the board clearly has no understanding of the game
once at the table you get the idea and the rest is history
he looks like me when i‚Äôm at a party and don‚Äôt know anybody but the host hostess
love the good boy what mix or breed is this beautiful dog
he‚Äôs just pretending to not know what he‚Äôs doing before you know it you‚Äôve lost all yo‚Äô money
i know that moment in the game where you did not listen to the rules enough
please just capture some video of him sleeping while it snows his chest expanding and contracting with every breath would be a pretty sweet loop
had a neighbor threaten to take my husky because i left her outside in the winter she hated being inside if there was snow on the ground the neighbor girl definitely didn t understand that crazy breed
my friend s family had a husky i remember when it was and the dog was sleeping flat on his back legs splayed in the snow on top of their picnic table
i used to have a chow chow that loved being snowed on all that fur i‚Äôll bet snow feels great
i love snow too it s in my top favorite things for sure
but you are his person on a time share arrangement be honoured
not only is hig not your dog but this is a blatant repost
you just happen to be located in hig s field and he slows you down as you try to walk past him
lol this guy seriously edited this photo to make it look like his this is a pathetic repost
someone is wondering why the hell their cat never comes inside now üòÇ
how to get a cat to use a bed you bought put it on the roof
cat huh roof pillow from god god must love cat thank you god
my question is why don‚Äôt you pick up after yourself
i wonder if the dog will work out he can get his pillow back by throwing down the box it came in
have you tried a fishing pole and fishing line with a hook
as we say in french le malheur des uns fait le bonheur des autres which literally translates to one s misfortune is another s boon
those hack roof repairs make me scream internally first jesus man just buy some peak tiles they aren t that expensive second if you re going to use aluminum flashing to do this at least install it bottom to top so the overlap faces downward and doesn t allow for a water intrusion path
aww yes i only have this to say this is so adorable
no one gonna ask exactly how the dog managed to throw its bed out the window when i was about three i got the sudden impulse to throw anything and everything i can out the window we lived on the second floor we had those iron grates on our windows for security but if i could squeeze it through and it wasn t bolted to our floor it flew literally anything and everything cd players walkmans magazines video games pillows clothes crayons seriously the list is endless
i read this as it has a new owner meow think it s time to go to bed
it s gonna be a bit sad when the pillow get s blown off or rained on
guessing this is what happens without building regulations codes
do you fish because o would be casting to get that pillow back
my dog would be menacingly looking at this from the roof til the end of time
i think the question here is how that pillow got on the roof in the first place
i love it when what would otherwise be an accident or inconvenience causes nothing but pure joy
kitty be like ‚Äúsweet a comfy place just like i‚Äôd hoped for‚Äù
wdym new owner the dog was obviosult borrowing it from the cat
official europa league football there aswell they ain t cheap
just curious how in the world the pillow fell through the roof
how the hell does a pillow fall to the roof oh that s how neat
good thing the pillow falling did not bring the roof down or the cat that is a very sad roof which is not going to last much longer where is btw i thought at once not portugal the tile was wrong for it i am curious now
that roof looks like it was planned as it was built by the builders
imagine living in a third world country and still posting to reddit
fell to a roof is not a something you typically hear
rapaz essas telhas essa manta asf√°ltica esse ch√£o podre essa foto √© no brasil
‚Äúfell to the roof‚Äù i know it makes sense but i‚Äôm disappointed none of you brought it up no pun intended
i can‚Äôt wrap my head around the term ‚Äúfell to the roof‚Äù
"oh se√±or don gato was a cat on a high red roof don gato sat he went there to read a letter meow meow meow
where the reading light was better meow meow meow
it was a love note for don gato i adore you wrote the lady cat
who was fluffy white and nice and fat there was not a sweeter kitty
meow meow meow
in the country or the city
meow meow meow
and she said she d wed don gato oh senor don gato jumped with glee he fell off the roof and broke his knee broke his ribs and all his whiskers meow meow meow
and his little solar plexus meow meow meow gt ¬°ay caramba cried don gato then the doctors all came on the run just to see if something could be done and they held a consultation meow meow meow
about how to save their patient meow meow meow
how to save se√±or don gato but in spite of everything they tried poor se√±or don gato up and died oh it wasn t very merry meow meow meow
going to the cemetery meow meow meow
for the ending of don gato as the funeral passed the market square such a smell of fish was in the air though the burial was slated meow meow meow
he became re animated meow meow meow
he came back to life don gato"
fell to the roof is not a phrase you hear very often
you should give that cat a home already has ur dogs scent

what part of the world is this that roof does not look watertight
bit of classy workmanship in that roof üôà surprised the pillow didn‚Äôt go straight though it ü§£
is no one else upset that the doggo tax hasn t been paid
if thanos is seeing this he will definitely snap his fingers
cat has also claimed a soccerball he she has got it made up there
if you want dog better you have to live and take care of your dog or any animals this is not the way of care
the wider angle doesn t look like a balcony how did the bed manage to fall out a window were you cleaning or something and stuck it up there
thought that was a giant weed plant at first glance
can i get an f for the lost football soccer ball up there as well
a woman‚Äôs on vacation and calls home she asks her husband how‚Äôs my cat doing the husband says the cat‚Äôs dead the woman‚Äôs upset and says well you could have broken the news to me when i got home i can‚Äôt enjoy my vacation now you could‚Äôve just said a little white lie like the cat‚Äôs on the roof and you can‚Äôt get her down okay i‚Äôm sorry says the husband i‚Äôll remember that the woman says anyway how‚Äôs my mother doing the husband says your mother‚Äôs on the roof and we can‚Äôt get her down
fishing line lead weight fish hook get your dog s pillow back
throwing the pillow out of the window and blameing the cat
silver lining now you get to see that sweet kitty snoozing happily
that s some shocking black work and the roof repair oh dear
i bet it s in brazil those roofs scream brazil for me
ngl i‚Äôm mad tired and thought your dog fell with it and was now sleeping there
comfy spot on a high vantage point that cat must feel so safe
what is this bounty that has come from the sky ah thank you ceiling cat
ugh i hate that i know exactly what that tile is and where it came from
gt napping cat falls three stories and pillow is so good she doesn t even wake up
i‚Äôm kind of worried about it sliding of the roof tbh
i‚Äôm worried that the pillow would be wet in rainy days
am high had to read fell to the roof three times slowly before i clicked and got it
that roof could use some work looks like it‚Äôs about to cave in
ok ok ok how does a guy drop his pillow to the roof
this will be me in three years living on someones roof laying on a tiny blue pillow
did your dog drop his ball too i bet the cat is going to sit on it next
there s about problems with that roof but a cat ain t one
what was your dogs setup that his pillow could fall did he give on your roof did you have a balcony without walls i m so confused
this is adorable but i feel bad fpr the dog like for a pillow for the dog
the cat really wants to knock that ball off the roof but knows you would appreciate that so the ball stays where it is
what fruit tree is that on the lower right hand side
the real question is how tf does a pillow end up on a roof
i thought that was a massive dope plant at first glance
looks like a turkish pic i dont know how but i am pretty sure
i thought you were gonna say your dog jumped for it and made it somehow
sweet little thing finally has a peaceful spot to relax
why was your dogs pillow on the roof in the first place
i think you mean it has a new owner meow i ll just give myself up to the pun police
wait how did your dog‚Äôs pillow accidentally fall to the roof
what a strange title to read what would you expect this to be a picture of if you only had the title to draw from
who is the owner of this photo you or dcancelik from twitter also with the same caption
aside from this being a cute pic and story i love the photo the lines angles textures and details
how does a pillow just call out of a window and how does it fall feet away from the building was there a tornado when it fell someone threw that pillow out of their window and you re lying for karma
fell to the roof was an interesting sentence before seeing the photo
what chain of events happened that the pillow landed on the roof
initially i thought that your dog jumped of the window as well xd
that cat probably thought it was the luckiest day ever
some good boye worked very hard to earn that pillow only to have a disgusting lazy kitty take it from him
where did it fall from the moon the top of a tree how does something fall onto the roof
this roofing job is exactly what i think of when you see those ‚Äúmilitary grade‚Äù commercials people think that is a good thing but after years in the af all it means is lowest bidder
nobody is going to ask how your dogs pillow fell several stories onto a roof
fell to the roof the fuck kinda house you be living in
this is waiting for someone to turn it into a children s book crop this photo and recreate it with watercolors or paint or somethi g and that s your cover
man what a windfall i ve had praise the pillow gods
ugh this ball was so close to get a perfect hit in the chimney
op didn t have a fishing equipment to get the pillow back for the sad doggo
imagine being a human and finding a bed on a roof and taking a nap
that cat probably has a comfy bed it s owner bought but refuses to use it
i didn t know it was such a foreign concept for some people that there are higher buildings and things fall from their windows or balconies on the roof of smaller buildings
where is this this rooftop and other things look similar to my place ones
you know you‚Äôre an old homeowner when all you can think about in this picture is how horrible of shape that roof is
i‚Äôm trying to figure out how a pillow falls on a roofs do you have multiple lol
cats always claim the comfiest seat in the house or in this case on the house
abit sad that the pillow will get wet and eventually break
one dog s thrown away pillows are another stray cats bed p s i suck at poems
to the roof below finally figured it out i just woke up and was so confused as to how something falls onto the highest point of a building
there s also a ball up there the roof of forgotten goods
i swear i see pictures of my black and white cat everywhere on reddit nowadays
man i couldn t live there i d be kobe ing stuff down that chimney every chance i got
the cat has been missing for a week and no one has seen it
i like how you knew it was out there but were just like ü§∑ well guess i lost a pillow
did it fall out or did someone push it out dun dun dunnnnn
i‚Äôm just here wondering how you drop a dog pillow presumably a static object for of its life off a balcony
the cats like ‚Äúthis is a sign from heaven must snuggle now‚Äù
the only reason kitty did it was because he knows doggo can see him in it kitty s are assholes like that
i wonder how long until the cat discovers and knocks that soccer ball off the roof
lol looking at this post again and i can t help but be reminded of game of thrones
i ll take that uefa authentic champions league red white colorway soccer ball along with the cat
initially i was wondering how the hell the pillow got there airplane lol
i imagine i m not the only one wondering how the pillow fell on the roof
kinda makes me worried about large birds coming and scooping them up
for a second i thought the dog was still on the pillow when it fell luckily i was bamboozled
the real question is how the pillow fell down to the roof
throw down more pillows and some boxes you could watch a community of cats blossom
looks like someone tried to throw a soccer ball down the chimney
you don t live nearby by any chance do you because that very much looks like my cat who suddenly does not come when i call him for his nap time i can see why now
that bed is probably soooo nice and warm from the sun
just want to address the elephant in the room if a pillow falls to the roof where did it come from another great metaphysical question people rarely ask themselves
imagine the unbridled joy as a cat to find this improbable scenario before you
this looks like the rich vs poor divide picture we see occasionally on reddit
day they still don‚Äôt know i‚Äôm growing massive weed plants under my window
how close does your dog sleep to the edge of your window
that car even has his own soccer ball up there living the dream
i d chill up there to if i was that cat new ball new bed the gods smile upon khajit
fell to the roof does gravity not work where you live
wait a sec how does a pillow fall onto a roof was it from a airplane
why is there a football too i‚Äôm starting to believe you aimed for the chimney with the pillow too
i m wondering what the story was of how it ended up there
there are so many things going on with that roof for one thing omg that wonderful red starred soccerball then the disrepair just makes me want to go and fix it all lol
how did your dog s pillow fall to the roof did you drop it from a plane
that roof looks like it does a better job as a cat bed than actually stopping water
missed a golden opportunity it has a new owner meow
i thought roof couple meant two people living on a roof
nice to see you dropped a dog bed onto someone else roof and just left it solid neighbor
first time seeing a post with over k upvotes great job
op must be eric clapton hope the dog doesn t sleep next to an open window
anybody not notice the red soccer ball on the gutter dude has better aim than ronaldo
i‚Äôm happy for that cat and then he could play with that soccer ball
am positive this is somewhere in india look at the ball roof kids never get permission to take it back spiteful shit
i didn t get why you didn t just go down and get it but i can see you re out of balls too
i m also feeling there s a sad story about the ball
i‚Äôm pretty sure this post belongs to someone else somebody else shared it with more photos and they took the captions and translated them
so you just left a moldy pillow to rot on your roof for days lol
looks like the outside of my old apartment in sao paulo neat
this pupper has the grumblies that only paws can satisfy
in a few months i m going to feel sorry for his ballberries
oh there s another foot what does that one taste like
quick question what kind of dog is that i ve never seen a white lab
i thought this was a polar bear at first what a cute puppy
love when he covers his eyes like he‚Äôs thinking i love nomming my paws but wow why does it hurt
i don t get it i want to chew on this but every time i do my paw hurts
mom timmy t timmy what are you doing are you okay timmy
his tail shows every emotion he had in those moments
repost but i don‚Äôt care this silly fluffy clumsy pup makes me happy every time
big doggo keep tryin smol pupper keep tryin someday u will learn how to dog but today is not that day ‚ù§Ô∏è
i love how mum just calmly watches the disaster unfold
if that‚Äôs clumsy‚Äôs mom she must be thinking how funny and adorable is my little boy i‚Äôve got my work cut out for me cheers
it s saw the demons in the water and got possessed so hard that it fell back
i just showed this to my mom and she‚Äôs crying laughing now
love the reaction of the parent no way i made this dummy
his little tail twitch when he s out of the water ‚ù§
thank you that was very funny sweet little thing got a snoot full of water mum‚Äôs face was a picture
looked like rudolph when clarice nuzzled him with affection
everytime i see this i have to give it a like and everytime i see and give a like all i hear is kevin hart yelling oh shit as he falls
excuse me miss but do you happen to have food with you i am asking for a friend
hey lady i can make you a princess here what you think üêøÔ∏è
beautiful photo she will cherish it late in life when climbing mountains and communing with nature isn t always possible
i was going to say i think your girlfriend is a disney princess but then i saw those leela turanga boots
not your girlfriend unless you re u engineeringexplained s alt account
not to be that guy but i m pretty sure that s a ground squirrel and not a chipmunk they look very similar but chipmunks have a stripe on their face as well as their body where the ground squirrel just has the stripe on his body amp x b i worked at crater lake national park and we had tons of these things they ll mug you for snacks
in my experience you can always find the fattest happiest friendliest chipmunks near mountain top picnic spots
i hope you offered him some food in exchange for taking his pic
i took this photo it‚Äôs lame to post other people‚Äôs photos and pretend it‚Äôs yours
im pretty sure this is just the reaction to chocolate milk
sugar is indeed the most universal and powerful of drugs
everything goes for karma around here even damaging your baby health smh
this has the same energy as shaq when he was on hot ones
the face of impending addiction and obesity i hate children
omg that clap at the end made me burst out laughing
this is how his addiction for brown cows started like
that moment you realized you created a monster a super adorable monster
sugar the crystalline plant extract that nobody seems to have a problem with
i still make that face when i drink chocolate milk today
and she just joined the rest of us on the sugar train woo woo
be prepared for a future where a tantrum is thrown if the milk is regular and not chocolate
in studies rats preferred sugar over cocaine addicting stuff that sugar
i m so glad a cow lived a life of torture so your kid could clap in a video
first one is free oh who am i kidding the child will everything for free until its teens
those brand new neurons making connections that ll last a life ti sips curldled chocolat milk on accident one day and it s gone
yep that was the high point of my life been all downhill ever since
that‚Äôs the face i make every time i have chocolate milk
me when i m high af drinking borden s chocolate milk
interesting how he clapped makes me wonder is clapping something genetically encoded into us like swimming is for example something that comes as a reflect to us since birth
i think this is the start of a beautiful friendship
you mean not everybody claps after each sip of chocolate milk
more fucking reposts from months ago disappointment
what if adults clapped at restaurants when they liked how their food tastes
yup same face my son made when his grandmother gave him a taste of ice cream for the first time
i remember my first chocolate milk you never get that joy again life is an endless cycle just trying to get that first chocolate milk feeling again but you never will you ll never be that happy again
why would you give sugary chocolate drink to a one year old are you nuts
i m years old and i still get that look when i have ice cold chocolate milk
you all do realize that they make ‚Äúchocolate milk‚Äù in order to sell the substandard milk that has been discolored from blood and puss right yes you read that correctly look it up
adorable kiddie for sure ‚ù§Ô∏è but no hand clapping for an introduction to a one year old of a highly addictive ‚Äúfood‚Äù i‚Äôm sure it had tons of added sugar amp unlikely it was pure chocolate
passing the torch of the most unconcerning but harmful drug out there
chocolate milk is so good it gets an applause break üòÇ
i know this is supposed to be cute but my only reactions is that this child looks like an old man i don‚Äôt think i‚Äôm built to raise kids
diamond ring sparkling in the sun when her hand passes by
you will never find a video of a baby behaving like this after eating broccoli for the first time
think this might be the first gif of someon s kid that i genuinely find cute and really interesting have an uptoot if it was plant based milk i ll give you two
yay get your young child hooked on sugar what a great idea
did you know that sugar‚Äôs effect on the brain is similar to cocaine‚Äôs now you do
am i the only one who sees the flashes of a trapped person
this could be the beginning of a beautiful addiction
reminds me of netflix documentary fed up sugar is more addictive than cocaine and in everything kid will be chugging that down with some muffins and waffles with syrup in no time
i will always remember the look on my baby niece s face when i gave her a bite of cheesecake it was like wow i get it everything makes so much sense now
people need to stop feeding sugary drinks to toddlers
i loved choco milk while growing up so i get it lil baby toddler
that s far too early for super sugary stuff keep them on bland vegetables as long as humanly possible so they don t develop a sweet tooth and throw tantrums if their dinner isn t sweet
ah get that child hooked up to excito toxins as soon as possible
i need to post my year old video of my year old drinking chocolate shake for first time
this is basically still my boyfriends reaction to chocolate milk he‚Äôs i don‚Äôt think you grow out of it ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
i‚Äôm so excited to do things like this with my future kids i watched my neighbors kid eat icing for the first time and the look of pure joy was hilarious and adorable
am i going crazy or was this video on here like a year ago fuck off with the reposts
you basically gave your baby crack they ll never want broccoli again
that s my reaction every time i drink chocolate milk
i m an adult and act the same way with chocolate milk
my wife is a dentist and she forbade giving chocolate cacao sugar our son up to years this will necessarily affect the health of the molars in the future
all my life i wanted a perfect chocolate milk but am always too picky when it comes to chocolate
i have never tried chocolate milk i m allergic to milk it is nice
i still remember the first time i gave my daughter ice cream she was one and had never had any sugar at first she tried to clamp her mouth shut and didn t want it then i put some on my finger and dabbed into her mouth she made that exact face and immediately said mo for more so cute
i m and that s still my reaction every time i have chocolate milk
is it recommended by doctors not to give chocolate milk to kids under year of age just curious as to why this child was offered a taste of chocolate milk late year but still why wait till the kid is year or more
i wish i could enjoy chocolate milk as i did when i was a kid too bad i‚Äôm lack toes in toddler ant
i m and still clap my hands when i drink chocolate milk
christ people i see all this ‚Äúsugar is a drug‚Äù banter here‚Äôs the deal sugar is a thing like anything else a little is fine and too much is a disaster it‚Äôs a cute video and if you have kids teach the right way sugar is a treat not a food group
my niece got a similar reaction but it was with cake
made me smile when she clapped at the end my son is months and doesn t clap yet but i gave him a strawberry for the first time the other day and his eyes got big and he kept going mmmm mmmm while eating it couldn t stop laughing
i too clap when i get the sweet nectar of the gods delivered to me via a straw
i reacted the same way to my first time with a guinness
bro this baby knows that chocolate milk is the shit
at this moment little karen realized she doesn t need those b obies anymore for milk
chocolate milk is one of the greatest things ever made
i m in my s and make that face when taking a swig of a good glass of chocolate milk
kumil nanjiani would want to put this in a hostel movie so pure
i like how it looks like she‚Äôs really processing it
aww it so cute to se life time sugar addiction begin i hope op posts some cute overweight diabetes pictures in twenty years
wait until that kid is up until am because you fed him a double latte cafe ya fucking tool
he s probably thinking yo mama why can t you tiddies make dis
this is how my dog reacted the first time i fed him durian
this is really cute what kind of cancer does she have
this marks the moment she realized that risking diabetes is totally worth it
the kid already knows how to smile and nod at the camera
thats my reaction every morning after my first cup of coffee
judging by the amount of times ive seen this reposted the kids probably three now
his face the first time ooooh that s some good shit
i m a grown adult and i still make this face at chocolate milk
i m nearly and still order chocolate milk every time i go to ihop hard habit to break after nearly decades
just wait till you tell them that chocolate milk comes from brown cows
yo this shit right here fire exactly what she said translated from baby
it‚Äôs insane how many comments are freaking out over a kid drinking a few sips of chocolate milk as if it‚Äôs somehow instant diabetes like nearly every kid hasn‚Äôt had chocolate milk
i m and still react like this when i have chocolate milk üòä
sugar sugar sugar yay for sugar i m set for life now
i was hoping the kid wasnt going to jam its mouth on that straw
i had chocolate milk the other day for the first time in probably years and i was like gooood daaaamn why the hell did i stop drinking this
poor kids gonna be chasing that brown dragon for the rest of her life
right after the first sip there is a face that is the epitome of mm interesting
i ve got a year old and we have never given him chocolate milk because once he tries it i am sure he will refuse to drink plain milk
they look like the comic with the kitten and the big mad dog
i wish i could see facial expressions needs more jpeg
i‚Äôm lucky to get this kind of reception every day when i arrive home from work few things compare to how great this is
well this made me cry a little that‚Äôs not usually something that happens
when people say that dogs don t love i just wanna slap them they love so unconditionally and remember you no matter how long you ve been away even if you just went out to take out the rubbish
the bark sounds half delighted and half scolding like how could you do that to me i thought you were dead never leave me again oh i love you i love you i love you i‚Äôm soooo happy you‚Äôre alive
hey do i hang on you look a bit like wait there are you oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god
i love that moment of disbelief when doggo just freezes and stares for a few seconds
three years good lord that‚Äôs a lifetime for a dog poor baby
the whole time i wanted to scream let go of the fucking leash
it‚Äôs like his owner ran away and he finally came back home
my maniac of a dog does this when i come home from work i wonder if he thinks i got lost every day
love how the guy looked up and suddenly remembered his gf was also there hahah
dogs are so great everyone in the background froze and watched as they reunited and that just made my day
and all i get from my cat after a long trip is meow signifying she is hungry
dad dad omg i have so much to tell you ive been such a good boy
beautiful just shows how much love our pets have for us my pupper acts like this when we get home from the grocery store dont know if that is cute or if he is a few whiskers short lol
i have a mastiff and he couldn t give shits about anything
and again absolutely all dogs simply better than some people
dog years or human years doesn‚Äôt make a difference but still asking for the record
videos like these are always so awesome and heartbreaking at the same time you can tell how excited they are to see them after so much time but also the sound the doggo makes is like years of pain and feeling abandoned leaving the doggo all at once
when i came home after years my dog didn t remember me
this is not a fraction of how my dog behaves when i leave the house for minutes i ll have to film her doing it because she is ridiculous it s like we ve been gone years and i might have just put the bin out
my ex and i share custody of our year old burnese golden mix this is still his reaction to me when i get him back every two weeks never gets old üòÅ
my doggo did this too it was like he was yelling at me for being gone but so happy i am back the next
this is so pure i get sad when i think that this dog likely spent a third of its life missing dad
is it just me or did it look like everyone in the airport froze until the dog recognized its owner
when what was supposed to be a happy occasion turns in to cringy situation
meanwhile at home the cat can give two shits about him coming home
my mastiff does that when i‚Äôve been gone for half an hour
this is the literal opposite of my cat after i came back after two years
heck this is my dog when i come home from work or the movies or the store or from getting gas
what you‚Äôve been gone for years and you just show up
i love how the dog takes a few seconds to realize he really is his human every time i went back home from college my little dory always took her few seconds to realize that yes it s him then proceeded to barf jump and pee all over
"nobody captain sparklez its probably having a seizure it might say something in the comments
nobody"
someone once tried to tell me that dogs don t have memories only associations yea they re wrong
imagine not knowing where your best friend went for years and then they just pop up out of the crowd
this video made my dog howl my dog has never howled
can you imagine being reunited with someone you love after years
what i want to know is what he was doing for three years
the unrelenting joy of the return of a lost scent the scent that brought food and comfort and discipline people ask do we deserve dogs i think this dog knows the answer this dogs knows we deserve and still need each other
anyone else thinking ‚Äútake off the stinkin collar so they can reunite ‚Äù love these‚ù§Ô∏è
you could unleash that dog and it would not leave that area i guarantee it
lol this must be in greece some guy shouts malala at end obviously not a dog lover
there are so many smells here i am soooo excited hang on i haven t smelled that crotch in forever could it be could it really be must spear sniff to be sure this doggo
this almost sounds like a dog version of that excited sobbing people do when they re just so overwhelmed by something that they just have an emotional breakdown
‚Äúyou bastard i thought you were gone forever don‚Äôt you ever do that again do you know what you did to me come here you big idiot ‚Äù what i imagine the dog was saying
i was hoping he would‚Äôve just gotten on the ground and consoled his dog more that would‚Äôve been my first instinct to calm my dog down they want to be as close to you as they can so when you‚Äôre standing that‚Äôs why they jump and flail and bark so they can get you down to their level who cares if it‚Äôs in an airport do it for your dog who you abandoned for three years by choice or not it doesn‚Äôt make a difference to them this is still super sweet and pure but disappointed by the owner‚Äôs reaction a little get all the way down and hold your dog in your arms for a minute i‚Äôd also like to point out that the girl holding the leash was tangling the dog up by not letting go and that contributed to the hyper panicked excited barks it was stressing out that dog the dog‚Äôs clearly not going anywhere so that was unnecessary to try to control it with the leash while it‚Äôs flailing on the ground
hell my dog acts like this when i come in from taking the garbage out
i imagine the joy being felt by the dog would be sometilhing similar to me bumbing into my mom who s been dead for years shock disbelief then welcome feelings of a mother s love that i haven t felt in so long
i swear i heard ‚Äúyou‚Äôre home‚Äù and ‚Äúi love you‚Äù in there
and some people say dogs and other animals don t experience emotions
mine acts like that after i‚Äôve been gone for an hour
years what was he doing survivalmode camping gone wrong
i may have turned my volume up a bit too high doesn t matter as it nearly brought me to tears
i thought this was a flash mob for a moment the way everything seemed to freeze when they first made eye contact
this right here is why i could never leave my animals for any extended period of time üíìüò≠
why do i see more and more people bringing their pets to public places like today i saw a dude carry his dog into walmart i thought that wasn t allowed
for goodness sake pick him up in your arms notebook style and give him a big ole juicy hug
gotta get a whiff first before he knows who you are
that was adorable and brought a tear to my eye but my dog acts the same way when i ve been gone for minutes
it s things like these that solidify my belief that a dogs do not live in the moment b don t remember things in the past and c doggos are the greatest thing god has ever given to man
i openly cried at this lost my big gal years back almost i miss her so much
where is there an airport that lets people bring in dogs
the a ep walks up and says can i have your dog my son has gotten good grades im calling the police and say that you stole my dog
this is my dog every time i get home from work and he has been free around the house because my wife is there
that moment when a dog freezes like that i‚Äôve seen it before there is a moment of quiet hesitation where the shape of the human seems familiar but what really triggers the dog is either the sound of your voice or more likely your smell a dog will remember the smell of a dear friend for a decade or more and they will always react with honesty upon meeting you again we do not deserve dogs but i am so glad we have them
karen let go of my fucking lease im with my human karen
not to belittle this video but my shepherd does this every time i get home from work
i always imagine the dog cursing and crying when i see these kind of situations you goddamn piece of you know how long i ve been waiting for you at the door each day you re lucky i m in a good mood i missed u
the bird is telling his friends about the little princess that rescued him
this right here should be made into a children s book
why would anyone complain about this awesome story buncha losers i suppose your daughter‚Äôs compassion should be commended
what a sweet girl you‚Äôre doing something right to have such a compassionate little one i‚Äôm sure the bird was thankful in his own little way
so cute i m curious did it hit the window the morning after a big storm here in chicago my daughter and i found white throated sparrows and another bird on the walk to school this friday they didn t fare as well as that bird i d only seen maybe one or two the previous years combined my only theory was that the powerful thunderstorm that rolled through the night before had cleaned the windows super well all were dry meaning they hit after the rain had stopped and in front of big clean windows
you are definitely doing something right in your parenting
putting something in the window like a picture or dark colored tape could help prevent confusion on the bird‚Äôs part your daughter might enjoy drawing pictures for the birds to hang in the windows
how dare you clean your windows so well that a bird would not know it is there what kind of animal are you disgusting
if you were wondering that is an ovenbird one of my favorites
i had a hummingbird hit my front door the other day i thought it killed him because it took about minutes for him to fly away but he was back at the feeder the next day i was so happy it was the only blackheaded one i have right now
i like the disclaimer plenty redditors would be like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre evil and you should die clean windows are directly responsible for the extinction of multiple exotic bird species ‚Äù
i really appreciate what you and your daughter did for this bird but bread is actually very bad for birds as they can t digest it properly just thought you should have a heads up for next time
wow you are such a good animal nurse you did such a wonderful job taking good care of your new bird friend thanks for sharing with us bye bye
i ve had three fly in my windows hard this month it s there any way to keep them from doing this
can one stop birds from flying into your windows why would people complain if there‚Äôs nothing you can do about it
and one day the bird and his friends will help the princess get ready to meet prince charming at the ball
parenting win she will never ever forget this day neither will she forget the magical healing power of a good book or empathy and kindness to others
we have a bird building a nest on our window ledge we have a big bay window that protrudes so there s a wren building a nest up there crazy things lol
we stick on black cutouts of birds on our windows in spring summer sometimes it doesn t help when its spring and they continue fighting their reflection
had a deck similar to that as a kid till my parents could replace it i was barefoot a lot injuries to report at least involving the deck us wisconsin girls are a lot more tough than we look disney princesses or not you‚Äôve got a pretty cool little girl on your hands congrats
what a lovely caring little girl it s great to see kids are still interested in nature
i was wondering how it is possible that a three year old can read
your daughter has good tastes bread and an elsa shirt that s the life for a small child
looks like those shiny expensive braided cables have you tried plugging it in
what kind of snake is it it does look like one of those shinny fish lures üôÇ
if this was taken in australia then it s called the urethrattler and shortly after this photo the snake crawled up ops pee hole and killed em
omg he looks like he strolls around your house like scar from the lion king and delivers snappy one liners every once in a while i love him
definitely a maine coone that chin those ears that floof
disney that s clearly macavity unless disney owns webber musicals too now
most people think these cats are so much better for their looks but it‚Äôs really their personality as wild cats in a snack size that makes them so great
yo what ever it is that i did im sorry please don‚Äôt look at me like that
wow that is some kind of kitty just beautiful love those eyes and that sweet expression too cute enjoy your floofernutter
you know he will be evil better just give him to me and save yourself
he s not a villain he s the streetwise cat that tells you how it is
cat looks like he s not amused and would like to sign a waiver for using his image for reddit purposes
he reminds me of kingdom hearts sora in the lion king
he looks like that villain who turns into animals in that duck tales movie can‚Äôt remeber the characters name tho
it looks like if sheer khan and scar had a baby and weirdly i am here for it
what kind if cat is that i want one like wow everything about it and those eyes really deserves a role on lion king
looks really inbred sadly inbred maine coons have serious health problems hip dysplasia hypertrophic cardiomyopathy polycystic kidney disease
all of you are wrong this is clearly gmork from the neverending story look out atreyu
everybody wants to be a cat because a cat s the only cat who knows where it s at
i d let that cat call me a fool as green fire exploded behind it
every time i see a maine coon i wish my fianc√© wasn‚Äôt allergic üò´
stoney mittens stars in the most raucous feline funny movie of the year cannabis cat laugh get the munchies laugh some more and then fall asleep with cannabis cat
that s the most amazing cat i ve ever seen just so gorgeous ‚ù§Ô∏è
i‚Äôm not a cat person but this breed is so cool i‚Äôd love it
he looks like scar before he grew up to be an asshole and tried to kill simba
if that beauty isn t from the play cats i don t know what is
when he grows up he will murder you in your sleep but adorably
if you like but whatever you do don t feed him after midnight
they are suppose to be of the smartest breeds we taught ours how to play catch they can learn how to open up doors and understand a few word s
and once i turn back into my beautiful self i‚Äôm going to kill you
it is good the people wear clothing m aiq wears clothing who would want to see m aiq naked sick sick people very sad
i wouldn t name it lynx he could steal my body or something and switch bodies with me
i m dying what type of cat is that so i can stalk it for years to come
it‚Äôs scruff the feral leader of a gang of deadly criminal cats in anginoux the royal city of young king belsus the fair scruff is tough on the outside but yearns to regain the nobility his family once knew and when the king is in dire need can he help the king and restore his family‚Äôs honor
wow gorgeous this has got to be some sort of exotic hybrid if it‚Äôs really mane coon
i believe he she‚Äôs a norwegian forest cat they have a very distinctive face
this kind of teminds me of the bad guy in the borderlands trailer
what a sweetheart üíï he looks back at the camera and expects someone to intervene he uses that look üëÄ and then turns back to his girl and comforts her with kisses and hugs ü§ó life is all better with a best buddy like this by your side
anyone know if this is just someones regular pet or like emotional support training just curious
the thing i look forward to most about not renting and having my own place is getting a dog cannot wait
‚Äúwhy are you just filming can‚Äôt you see she‚Äôs upset ‚Äù
even me a dedicated cat person thinks we don t deserve dogs like this
this isn t the time to f cking film brian there there sweetie everything will be fine
the one i really bawled in front of my dog after getting really bad news he started licking my face now he is not a very affectionate dog so as he was doing that i wasn‚Äôt sure if he was trying to comfort me or just really liked the taste of my tears probably the latter he‚Äôs an asshole and i love him
when she looks back at the camera like ‚Äúhooman she cry why she cry‚Äù my heart ü•∫
i just adopted a dog who was cuddly but not really affectionate the other night i broke down in tears because of recent heartbreak and he jumped up on the bed and nuzzled his face under my hands and rested it on my face it was nice
i get a dog understanding genuine tears innately we probably release hormones and such that change our smell or whatever but fake tears they must have to learn what it means first no
my dog could care less if ur crying as long as u mk him feel better when he s upset
i don‚Äôt understand how people can be so mean to them either
this makes my heart ache at how much i miss my dog she s been gone years and i still miss her everyday
look at that tosser just filming you know i love you best he not worth it but i am worth all the chicken
as many people have pointed out while this is a cute moment there s something to be said about the human standing there filming this person s breakdown
don‚Äôt cry i give you hug i love you ear slap slap slap slap
been living through a rough patch but this made my day thank you op
what are you doin i can‚Äôt see your face gerald are you gonna help or just stand there here i give hug
the last time i cried my cat just jumped on the table and stared at me with a face full of disgust and contempt
beagles are the best i have two puggles and they are so precious
this is very relatable for me my cat does the same thing
every single time i have cried no matter where my dog went and laid on me if i was there it on my bed when j wasn‚Äôt my family always knows when i cry
i love beagles ours can tell when i‚Äôm upset so nice to cuddle with
i hope that once we go extinct from our own hubris dogs take our place at the top of the food chain and set a better example for the rest of the animal kingdom
so the dog does the consoling and the human holds the camera got it
beagles are the best dogs ever i have two and they are the sweetest dogs i‚Äôve ever seen
and asian people you know what they do with these creatures only reason i don t buy xiami or samsung smartphone
this is seriously cute i see some mega cute stuff here but very rarely does it make me go awww
my german shepherd was always such a gentle giant in this respect he knew the pain me and my father were going through in the divorce and would always greet us in concern with licks i would hug him on the constant for emotional relief he didn t like to be hugged and i knew it but i think he put up with it cause he knew it made me feel better humans don t fucking deserve dogs for what the assholes among us do to them but when the relationship is positively mutual it s so sweet and should never be taken for granted people go hug your dogs right now
i had a beagle who used to do this kind of thing all the time when my wife would be crying or upset this reminded me of charlie who passed away last year sweet doggo
awwwwwwww when i cry my dog just looks confused then leaves the room haha
our family dog would try to break up anything he considered a fight between his humans then when k got my own dog he d hug and kiss whenever i was sad i had a nightmare once one of thos really awful ones you need to like keep all the lights on for hours and drink gallons of tea aaanyway nigtmare dog wakes me up by licking my face and barking and pretty much woke whole household up because i had a bad dream dogs are the best
my cats would do stuff like this they were both very affectionate normally but annoyingly so one was skittish any sudden movement and she d disappear whenever i was sick they d both come up to me let out a small chirp each climb into my lap and curl up my orange boi on my left and my tortiose shell on my right every single time it s been a year since i lost my babies
looooove beagles my family‚Äôs beagle would do the same exact thing i would get another one if they weren‚Äôt so damn obsessed with food miss you chester
see whenever i do this to girls they just call me a creep and i get kicked out of the supermarket
he looked at the camera guy like ‚Äòwhat do i do hooman help‚Äô
my dogs comforted me after one of them died i honestly didn t think they would care or notice that she died but they really did
my doggy gets wild with the kisses and the jumping on me when i cry this is great but im one of those really cute commercial or kids were nice to each other on a cooking competition criers so the poor thing probably things im near suicidal it s like he can feel me crying he comes barreling up the stairs and just launches himself onto my lap and gives me giant smooches he s about lbs he is not a lap dog god i love him
i assume this is a therapy dog now i don t need one but i d sure be happier with one
dogs are just the best thing to have happened to this world
my husband gets really mad at me when i do this with our dog ‚Äúemotional manipulation ‚Äù bah
someone once told me that if a dog sees us cry then they think that it s maybe because of them and they feel kind of stressed as well can anyone tell me if this makes sense or is it bs
animals are too precious theyre such emotionally intelligent animals my friends cat used to nudge my face whenever i cried
when i was a child my grandma had a lot of rescued cats one she got as a kitten and it lived to be years old that one cat but none of her others knew when you were sad even if i wasn‚Äôt crying but was just sad she would come and do her best to stare eye to eye and meow in a different and somewhat calming way she would keep at it even if you tried to push her away if you were actually crying it was even more intense of a reaction when you felt better the cat would go back to acting normal just a random black cat that a neighbor found as a stray kitten and knew my gram would take care of i think of that cat all the time
dogs are just the absolute best cya later fuckers gonna go play with my dogs
i had a beagle terrier who normally was a complete spaz however if you were sick and laying on the couch she would gently climb up on you and lay her neck across your neck then she‚Äôd give you a solitary lick and a look that seemed to say ‚Äúrest up i‚Äôll check on your later ‚Äù
this is my dog whenever i come home wont leave me alone til ive sat down and hugged him
if this were a cat it was just stare at you with shame
actually had a cat do something like this one time when i was feeling depressed
huge dog fan weirdly not too much into beagles not even a reason for it but this is just absolutely sweet and touching cracks me up though how he has to stop and shake for a sec possibly itchy because you know dogs ‚ò∫
we don t deserve dogs i especially don t deserve mine but i love him more than anything
the concern in her gorgeous eyes we only scratch the surface of understanding our canine friends
if you are teasing the dog please stop he looks so worried
what have we ever done to deserve dogs and i fucking love beagles so sweet
we don t deserve the purity of dogs sometimes my dog does that too when i m really upset he somehow knows and will scratch on my door to let him in then he ll stay with me till i m okay
she mustve have just watched the got finale and realized that was it
should ve laid the scarf on the ground and let the dog sleep on top of it since the ground steals more heat than the air survival
i m heart broken that the dog s homeless and crying that a lady left something of herself for a homeless not a person but a dog
this is nice and all but pretty stupid i m sure seconds later the dog got up and walked away like nothing happened and then for the next couple weeks there was a random dirty ass scarf lying around in the gutter on this street
i should leave my pets on the street during the daytime get some pretty nice free shit
i feel bad for the scarf having its heart broken by it s owner being left behind for a dog i mean sure the dog is actually living and breathing being and maybe a scarf just can t compete with that but is there no value in the relationship between a woman and her scarf anymore besides polyamory is more accepted than ever she didn t have to leave one to be with the other but no she left all of that behind for a dog
oh my gosh that s incredibly sad poor dog curled up like that just wishing someone would love him
oh god who is cutting all of the onions in my room right now
does no one have a problem with littering anymore s
to me that woman is what i considered to be beautiful
in fact that was a tablecloth she got as a gift from her mother in law
i pray he has found a forever home and god bless that wonderful lady Ôªø
its always the worst when you see an animal in need i sometimes feel its even worse than seeing a person struggle because they can t fend for themselves
very sweet but will a scarf help they are pretty thin still a good deed
dog s got a red carpet probably got the limo parked around the corner
this is so sweet i upvoted this for her even though i don t like the name of the subreddit ffs everything in language culture and religion is geared towards men why are women bros
is this worthy of a little prose by u schnoodledoodledo
i bet a crackhead stole it from the dog minutes later
what the hell how is it possible for people to even do this you d have to be a literal demon to throw a dog out like that also i would ve done more than give a darn scarf i would ve called someone at least or something a scarf doesnt help
stuff like this is truly great it‚Äôs one thing when people record themselves doing something nice for social media likes but it‚Äôs a whole other thing when stuff like this is found on security cameras this woman rocks
i couldn t help but find it funny that she left a thin scarf for the dog then picked up her umbrella and walked away like i get it but it was funny
take himm home or to a shelter u ass still nice of u but ughhhh
my brother got yelled at for doing this outside of an airport in india one time
kindness shines not in the bright light of day it is reflected back in the eyes of those gifted it in the darkness
another fucking dog apparently sleeping outside on a pavement more staged shit fuck the scarf take the dog
it s so sad that dogs are living in the streets all over the world if that were me i d take the dog with me
isnt this the cut version i m pretty sure another lady walks by like seconds later and takes the scarf
no one fucking said that i‚Äôm so tired of this show me what you‚Äôve done for animals that i can‚Äôt reverse search and prove you talk shit and do nothing
i m rooney the dog am no longer a pup but this is my face now that i m all grown up may not be front page or exceptional cute but love just as much when my frens boop my snoot i m no fancy pedigree don t have no floof but my human loves me n here is the proof they posted my picture n brought me such joy just showing the world this is my goodest boy
thank you for showing us he looks like a very good boy
he looks the like dog from howl s moving castle i m not sure why maybe it s the angle of the photo makes it look like he has tiny legs and a big head
he definitely looks like a kind and gentle boi give him a boop for his reddit fans out here please
he looks like he s got a phd in good boy and he s good boy certified
well i think that‚Äôs a really good idea he‚Äôs your best boy and he definitely deserves his minutes in the sun thx for sharing cheers
nice name thats the name we gave our pup hes an old pup now we are from pittsburgh and are rabid steeler fans so rooney was perfect üòÅ
rooney is the source of all happiness he s a cool breeze on a hot summer day and a soft blanket on a chilly winter evening
of course he s a good dog no receipts necessary although i am happy you shared his boopable snoot with us all
not like you need a reason to post a photo of your dog it s a doggie good enough reason to me cuuuuute
everytime i see one of these pictures i just wish i could pass my hand through and pull the dog out of the screen seriously
your dog is literal proof that older dogs are cuter than pups no one me gt
i ve owned dogs nearly all my life after careful examination and consideration i can say with certainty that rooney is an very good boy
shut up u egg and get out of cowells hole won t tell u again
there may be nothing unusual about him but there is definitely something special about him
this dog is so adorable but he kinda reminds me of the actor zach mcgowan the actor for jody from shameless and that captain in black sails
"what do you mean nothing unusual
he has a massive head uuuh what a good boy"
the average dog is a nicer person than the average person andy rooney
he deserves all the love just for being who he is ‚ù§Ô∏è
that looks so similar to my dog i‚Äôve never seen another dog that looks like mine until today wow
they are all good dogs until they mirror a bad parents personality pets to your good boy
the snoot drooped so he wants you to boot his snoot
good old fella lotta snow in that muzzle he s seen a lot deserves a warm spot by the fireplace and an infinite amount of scratches
profile created days ago and first post gets this many upvotes rightt
he is a good handsome boy sometimes you just gotta post the handsome doggos
i like how ‚Äòaww‚Äô is becoming a more exact definition everyday it‚Äôs not ‚Äòhere‚Äôs a cute thing‚Äô anymore it‚Äôs ‚Äòhere‚Äôs a thing that has been portrayed as vulnerable‚Äô this picture is the perfect example just a normal dog no there‚Äôs ‚Äúnothing unusual‚Äù about him so nothing that would give the masses a reason not to ignore him which then becomes ‚Äòaww poor dog being ignored by reddit‚Äô this is not a criticism just found it interesting how my own definition of all things ‚Äòaww‚Äô changed from ‚Äòcute things‚Äô to ‚Äòvulnerable things‚Äô and how with good rhetoric any picture could be framed as of something vulnerable
i wish i had a doggo especially one as good as rooney
oh my goodness hello rooney good boy give him a scritch behind the ear for me
give him scritches for me from hims fren from far away
i know a good dog when i sees one and i sees a good dog

man rooney looks really similar to my dog they could be siblings they‚Äôre so similar my dog is a mutt of unknown parentage any idea what rooney is
remembers wayne rooney rooooooooonnnnneyyyy as some kind of a boo
he is pretty unusual in that he has a rather large nose but it works for him
because you didn‚Äôt call your dog a ‚Äú doggo ‚Äù or ‚Äú pupper ‚Äù or ‚Äú woofer ‚Äù or ‚Äú fur baby ‚Äù or ‚Äú goodboye ‚Äù or‚Ä¶ amp x b note to future posters it‚Äôs possible to post a nice picture of a dog‚Äî and have it noticed and appreciated‚Äî without using stupid memes
he deserves to be virtually loved on just as much as the others he looks sleepy sweet in this picture ü§ó
wait two accounts claiming this picture u thekevinshow a year ago and he reposted his link to this new post which the user u xavipy is only four days old i don t know what is going on
thanks for sharing him we love good bois and they re all good bois üíï
go rooney you are special because dogs are the best ever
screw you man who gives awards for this type of reposting
you re a pathetic and borderline worthless piece of shit
wrong way to climb a ladder hold the upright not the rung
a kitten tree you‚Äôve struck it rich have you found the mum to trap and spay
serious question would it be bad if you put a little bowl of milk in there
north american kitten tree i thought those were extinct
i flipped over the log and found a tiny little stick and i was like ‚Äúthat log had a child ‚Äù
so here s the story i was removing ivy from the tree as i was told the ivy would strangle the tree and kill it over time while yanking away the ivy i found a hole in the tree and saw movement thought it was birds at first but upon closer instpection saw it was kittens amp x b after consulting a vet we decided to remove them from the tree as the hole is meters above the ground and the probably wouldn t have survived a possible fall we have kept them inside with us for the last few days all worm and cozy we re feeding them propper kitten milk x a day we re also tracking their weight gain they ve all gained g on average in less then a week the mother still shows up in our yard every now and then but it s a wild cat and we can never get within a m perimeter of her amp x b we ve already decided to keep we already have other cats the others are already claimed so happy we get to keep them for another weeks at least before they go off to their own forever home
what happened with momma was there no way to shelter them outside where she would find them
someone help i can‚Äôt tell what part of the kittens the black roundish spot is on the bottom right of the screen
is this where you harvest the kitties for pet season üò≠
oh my goodness how absolutely adorable and precious üíñüíñüíñ
so is this tree like a kangaroo keeping the joeys in their pouch until they re big enough to go out on their own
kittens were at least weeks old as that is when they open their eyes
please please op find a way to get those kittens into a home feral cats kill so much native wildlife and once kittens are a certain age they almost can t become pets
i‚Äôve never seen fury birds before but there very cute looking
please keep an eye on them and be ready to take them in if they stay outside they will become feral and unadoptable they ll keep breeding and the kitten population will grow exponentially you might be able to capture the mother in a humane cage and perhaps foster her inside your house to let her raise the babies or inquire with a shelter that has volunteers to help with that kittens born outside don t have much of a chance
how did the delivery go i read trees going into labour can shake up quite the storm they get really rooted going through it too right
oh they re going to fall out when they become active great hiding place though kudos to mommy no tom would think to look there lt
the birdsong and sunlight makes this the most idyllic thing i ve seen in weeks thank you
by law you now have to adopt them and make sure they grow up to make more tree kittens
of course the golden retriever is in the water with the baby water is like a magnet to them
if he eats the poop when the babe craps in the tub i m sold
wow that is cute they re gonna grow up together and be the best of friends
i m all for puppies and babies being cute sure but you put the puppy in the tub with your naked baby for a photo that s kinda fucking weird to me
if you re sexualizing a naked infant enough to think it s nsfw maybe don t
i think that‚Äôs the sound of my ovaries exploding too freaking cute
this is probably nsfw because no one wants to see another photo of your kids or pets karen
the fact that this is not safe for work makes it child pornography
when my bulldog crashes in on me in the tub it‚Äôs not nearly as cute
that puppy has the expression of total horror on his face s he has seen some things that can t be unseen
this is too much cuteness my head is going to explode
what is that small child so fascinated by what draws his attention away from the puppy
such a sweet adorable puppy the naked baby is gross though
does no one else think it‚Äôs super fucking weird to post a naked photo of your child to the public
better hope that puppy doesn t have something or bye bye baby
that‚Äôs the cutest puppy i would pay lots of money for that pup where did you get it from
our dachshund romeo once walked right up to a great dane and bit it‚Äôs lip romeo was an asshole god rest his soul
that poor great dane is probably terrified out of his mind
i only see two dogs in the picture am i missing something
my little guy barks his head off at german shepherds pit bulls boxers but walks right on by great danes they just don‚Äôt register as dogs to him
horse explain ur smo snausage no u horse lol heckin whaaaaat
somebody should put the mac startup sound under it just like they did in wall e
you can t charage to this coz he is natural and beautiful cat
ah yes since you guys so much about computers who‚Äôs gone put the sound underneath the video
step touch sleeping cat with charger step yell step post as gif and profit
when my phone is at and i run and slide into my bedroom and charged my phone right before it turned off
it was at that moment that kittynet became self aware listen and understand that kittynator is out there it can t be bargained with it can t be reasoned with it doesn t feel pity or remorse or fear and it absolutely will not stop ever until it catches that red dot
so cute cat and look at her pretty eyes it s eyes activities is so attractive i love it
i work with an older guy that looks exactly like this bird
the damn bird looks like it is too stupid to continue surviving neat
it looks like they got into a fight with a hammer head shark and lost
my daughter saw one at the zoo and called it the bernie sanders
no pets in the office shows this picture i ll make an exception because he looks very polite
if the pangolin is waiting to nervously ask you to prom this bird is his dad being proud of his son for asking someone even though he s so nervous
i shall stare into your soul and make you happy for the rest of your life
his name is eric and he swears hes going to leave the it department soon and start up his own tech company unfortunately hes been saying the same thing for the last years
how i look trying not to snap at stupid customers at work
damn we need to take care of this look at what happened from killing just one albatross killing all of them we re in for a bad time
time to ring the gong bois he he small foot reference
i have cats only one does this he hasn‚Äôt seen a piece of paper he doesn‚Äôt like lol
i hope he charges a good price i‚Äôve been asking my cats to get jobs but they just nap professionally
this is cute until you need to wipe your butt at midnight and your cat shredded all your toilet paper
argh paper towel i shall defeat you straight after this little nap
that brings back memories i had a little shredder like that he s almost now he s slowed down a little now he only shreds one layer of tp instead of all the tp
years ago i had a maine coin who loved rolls of paper towels i came home one time to find a perfect mountain of paper towel shreds in the middle of the living room floor he had taken a brand new roll that i had forgotten and left on the table and turned it into thousands of pieces none of which were any bigger than my thumbnail and they were all neatly piled up into a perfect little mountain there were no pieces anywhere else in the house
very adorable minus the giant stabby things attached to its head made me nervous
if i see a prey animal take off like that i get nervous lol
so fast yet they still get eaten ass first by hyenas
reminds me of when we went camping we caught some fish and tied our cooler up in a tree so no scavengers could dig through it we woke up in the middle of the night to a bear in the tree trying to knock the cooler down
seems sketchy anytime theres baby cubs youre basicslly fuckt
always thought climbing a tree when i piss of a bear would save my life
i imagine momma bear down there going ‚Äú you come down here this instant brian ‚Äú
that s why you don t run away from a bear play dead or make loud noises at least you ll die like a pro
kudos to the cameraman momma bear might be right behind them
wow it climbs as easily as walking down the sidewalk
they will do better than some human drivers on tight streets with many cars parallel parking
what a sweetie more power to the bears i sure hope that little fella can get back down again what a cuddly looking tushie Ôªø
jim tell him bears can climb faster than they can run
spiderbear spiderbear does whatever spiderbear does does he swing on webs no he s a bear just watch out for mama bear
am i the only one who had a world of warcraft flashback here
it s all fun and cute until they re adults and chase you
oh and the ‚Äúbears can‚Äôt run downhill thing ‚Äù so not true saw a video a while ago of a female running downhill and it was terrifying
as i was walking to tend to my marijuana plantation one day i turned the corner to see two baby bears the only aww was aww crap where is mom not cute scary
i love seeing cute animals in their natural environments just doin their own thing this is so much better than videos of animals in a zoo
get out the momma bear is there let s put it this way i would rather be at the top of a erupting volcano than meet a momma bear and her cubs especially a angry momma bear and her cubs
baby humans can t even climb out of the pit in my basement
i actually felt fear cuz i was scared it was gonna fall off
looks like me if there was a bag of swedish fish at the top
john what the frick are you doing i am the stealth all in british accent
yeah and he s the radio guy when it s no longer a stealth mission you ll thank him later
the other two look so worried that their cover has been blown
is this the inspiration for farfetch the pokemon from s might have butchered the name
this owl has been fitted with a transmitter pack that will not interfere with his daily routine now researchers will be able to monitor this bird s daily activities without outside interference
shall we tell george he s got a stick stuck in his feathers nah it ll be funny when he eventually notices
this was the moment when they found out their friend had been replaced by a bot
pretty sure the other two are just questioning the third s fashion choices
kowalski analysis skipper it seems private has an antenna coming from him ill be hoover damned
the owl in the middle reacts like a cartoon soo cute
they sort of look like robots that can‚Äôt process the new information
times i ve seen this times i ve laughed times i ve upvoted this level of adorable special never seems to get old
alright guys i got the wmd you sure man that kinda just looks like a stick
snake this is supposed to be a stealth mission with all due respects colonel i need this antenna to communicate with you like i am now snake antennas receive electromagnetic frequencies they were created for long range communication in due to this it also attracts the signal that activates foxdie electromagnetic frequencies foxdie snake for this section you won t be able to use the radio since you are at risk unnggh risk
love the way the middle one kept shaking it s head as though it got aneurysm
as may times as i‚Äôve seen this this caption is probably my fave
bird in the middle i ve told you this several times during the planning phase that this was to be a stealth mission emphasis on stealth
damn it bill we told you to leave that shit ash home this time
doo doo doo doo dooo doo dooo dooo game over owwwwllll owwwwwllll
the middle one shaking its head like ‚Äònope still there well i knew john was stupid‚Äô
one in the middle is so shocked then he says fuck it while the right one is still flabbergasted but the left owl is in the right you do need a radio guy
he s just starting a trend the others may think it s strange now but wait until it catches on who will be shaking their head then
i like that the burrowing owls that s what these are are just looking like they think he s injured
why otto you seem to have altered yourself yeah you think the missus will like it
fun fact owls eyes have a tube like shape and can t move around in their skulls which is why they move their whole heads to look around like that
‚Äúwtf hold on am i seeing this correctly guys you‚Äôre seeing this too right ‚Äù
they have to be home before the street lights comes on
watching mama cats hide their babies is so cool it s less cool if you ve ever had to witness the aftermath of them having eaten a litter but it s really cool when that doesn t happen
please get these little ones homes if possible they deserve the best life possible also if you have the space and time take the mama in or at least have her fixed
i‚Äôm in this same situation my cat had kittens somewhere on my neighbors property and we can‚Äôt find exactly where
i should show this to my judgmental fam when they call my floofy sheltie fat ü§®
next time you bathe your dog take a pic of him with his fur wet for comparison
reminds me of the first time i gave my cat a bath looked pretty freaky without the fluff
samoyed s because of their coats have no problem with summer heat in las vegas nv as long as they can keep their paws wet and cold
this is one of the worst posts i‚Äôve ever seen how is it aww because it‚Äôs a dog yes dogs are cute but that‚Äôs setting the bar pretty low the dog isn‚Äôt doing anything remarkable at all next we have this weird outline of the dog beneath its fur but the outline is weirdly muscular and way too big like some furry dog fetishist has drawn it to look buff please delete this
lol my shaved german shepherd was skinny as hell the definitely do not look like this under that hair
my mom shaved her chow chows one summer the males were super muscular under the fluff
this dog looks jacked i think you was a little generous around the jaw with the outline
what a lovely samoyed they can really be quite muscular under all that fur my samoyed weighs lbs but he doesn t look like it i was worried he was getting a little extra weight since that s over average breed standards but the vet assured me it s quite normal for an active dog so yeah this might look funny but they can be quite muscular looking they also do have large chests naturally
i fluff ball is like this when he‚Äôs dry he looks stocky and fat when he‚Äôs wet he looks half his weight and like a sad little rat
it s weird that your dog let you paint those lines on him like that what a good boy
brings a whole new meaning to all fur coat and no knickers
can relate my sister have a japanese spitz long fluffy fur
wait the floof isn t business if you think it isn t try shaving a husky and seeing how far you get in the snow actually don t do this because the worst case scenario is that you end up with a dead dog and the best case scenario is that you end up with a partially shaved and very pissed off dog along with enough scratches to immediately cause bandage manufacturers stocks to go up dramatically
my collie is essentially a drowned rat in a ghillie suit
top reposts all time doesnt make it less cute though take my karma you bastard
this would be a nurse dog a dog with the job of nurse a dog nurse is a human nurse who works with dogs
looks like the retriever is giving blood if i m not mistaken
pictures like this is the reason i‚Äôm sceptical about getting another dog until mine passes they get attached and one dies and i have to see my other dogs heart shatter
i wanted to be your one good boi but i‚Äôm your second and it still counts
our dog looks like your dogs twin what is your dog mixed with we rescued ours and they didn‚Äôt know
granted though it‚Äôs may nd and the pictures brightness is so high you can‚Äôt recognize the doggo
i read the title as paper boi and started singing the rap from atlanta still works with pupper boi
my baby girl looks literally the exact same i have so many of these nose images on my phone haha what a beautiful boy
brightened my day sometimes i just go to reddit to look at pictures like this
that‚Äôs a really lovely boi and yes my day is now much brighter thanks
it s brightened all my days for the rest of eternity
you re an awesome person this reminds me of a quote i heard about adopting older animals i choose to break my heart so they can live the rest of their lives without breaking theirs something along those lines it got blurry near the end when i first read it someone must have been cutting up onions near me at the time
what a beautiful thing to do well done op hoping you have some lovely memories with this fella i would love to help some older animals in this way gosh it would be heart breaking though
wonderful i m going to do this too with cats and dogs i m getting older and so are all of my dogs and cats when they pass on i plan to adopt old and sickly animals from the shelter much love to you you help balance the bad in the world
what a beautiful thing to do so happy that he ll spend his remaining time loved and cared for
that is a beautiful boy and you are a wonderful person ‚ù§Ô∏è
thank you for the gold no idea what it means but i m going to find out i ll get some vids of him up
this is truly heartwarming ‚ô•Ô∏è thank you for giving the little bugger a loving home
thank you for doing this i am doing the same thing i just got my first old girl kitty with some medical issues and like you it has been so rewarding she is so happy has a great personality and love to play she also has a tendency to snort cat nip so we are trying to break that habit but i m glad that even if her time with me is short she did not have to spend the rest of her days in a small kennel at an animal shelter and she got to experience love i know your kitty appreciates it as well
thank you for giving him the life he was meant to live look into colloidal silver as a supplement to boost his little immune system ‚ù§Ô∏èüòò
and here i thought i might make it through an entire day without tearing up what a gift you have given the karma train needs to load up on good things and stop twice at your house lt
what an amazing service you‚Äôre doing i‚Äôm sure the rewards are endless
i wonder how this works financially not to smaller your efforts and you are awesome for doing that but doesn t it cost a ton of money i mean sick and old animals do have to see the vet more often and they charge quite a lot how do you manage that
that s an awesome thing to do one day i hope to do something similar
that so awesome and wonderful of you can i make kind of a strange suggestion i was given a cat a few years ago that was very overweight and sick she had the kitty diabetes as well as being about years old my vet told me i shouldn t expect her to live more than maybe months but i did some research and read some internet stories and started her on a raw food diet lots of liver and bone marrow she perked up within a week lost about pounds which for her was a lot and she lived with us for another years
the world needs more people like you you help to restore my faith in humanity
thank you what a beautiful and meaningful way to give to animals they are so full of love and it‚Äôs so wonderful that someone like you exists and sees that they deserve to be loved and comforted in the end you are a beautiful person with a beautiful heart üíó
thank you for giving so much of yourself i m sure you are getting just as much back
you are an earth angel ‚ô° thank you for doing this for him and the others you will help in the future you are a true hero
the fev dear god i can only imagine the monstrosity that will result once it s run it s course
you are so strong to be able to do something as wonderful as this i envy you i‚Äôm glad people like you exist
i respect this so much please if it s not too much trouble post his progress as everyone else said you are amazing i truly believe i m not brave strong or courageous enough to do this bless you sir
this warms my heart so much you can‚Äôt even imagine üíï you are an amazing person i hope you make great memories with this adorable kitty he is very lucky to have you and i‚Äôm sure you will make each other so happy
get him on a real meat diet this can help greatly with blood sugar and weight issues either way good on you d
so awesome of you to do this we have a year old that could be his twin these old guys are the sweetest
dang that s dedication i didnt know animals could be saved from tar that deep
guys please see their youtube channel animal aid unlimited india they really do work hard have a look at their videos
the third pup probably got stuck trying to save the second pup who was trying to save the first very cute
i wonder what cleaning solutions they used to separate them from the tar i think that would have been fun to work on clean some tar feed them some water clean some tar give them a treat clean some tar boop them on the nose etc etc etc
not looking forward to the days when my dog is this old what a precious boy he is
this is the best i had an old boy make it to he‚Äôs a good good boy
oh man i wish i could give this good boy a nice scratch
such a good round boy hope he gets nothing but happiness for the rest of his life
he s not my dog but i saw him on dogspotting and figured you all would enjoy this good boy
maybe it s a benjamin button case and this is actually the biggest puppy we ve ever seen
you don t need to tell him that he s a good boy look at that smile he knows
give it a few more hours for the reddit veterinarians to start posting
that poor dog is severely overweight you should be ashamed
chunky boy is a good boy he perseveres that‚Äôs the secret to success in life
this dog is old and i‚Äôve been there with an old dog and people casting their opinions that they aren‚Äôt being looked after bless you and hope you make the most of your time i lost my old girl months ago she reached an incredible age for her breed and you love them more the older they get xx
anyone reddit here s why you re a terrible pet owner
he is also overweight put him on a diet and his joints will thank you
poor guy is the my lb life dog version wouldn t matter much that he is old if he wasn t so obese i hope he is on some glucosamine to help with his poor joints he s the best boy but his humans could be better
he reminds me of my uncle who is also big around with tiny legs
he mega chonk amp x b he is a good boi but still needs a diet to relieve stress from his joints amp x b i see a senior dog everyday i don t own him but each day he smiles as i pass him
get that pupper checked for a thyroid condition we had the same issue with our girl and within a few months she was a different dog slimmed right down
good boy no doubt but pls take some weight of his warn joints with some sort of diet
i‚Äôm sorry there may be a genuine medical reason for his weight and i apologise if there is but that is fucking cruel the dog can barely walk because of the weight he has to carry i do not understand how people can do this to their animals that they ‚Äòcare‚Äô for
my dog takes tri acta maximum strength for joint health it was like a miracle i was incredibly worried about his health when his he started limping and his joints seizing one or two days on tri acta he was good as new this sounds like a commercial but i am serious they have two sizes small and large it is worth it it has glucosamine which is what the joints are missing
the only thing aww about this is aww i feel really bad for that dog his owners failed him poor guy
i imagine this is what it will look like if manatees evolve and grow legs
our dog is almost human years and behaves like this
y‚Äôall leave op alone this isn‚Äôt even his dog and you‚Äôre acting like he belongs in the th circle of hell
put that poor dog on a diet amp x b it s horrible you let him get that fat
my dog is also overweight however so am i we are both working on our fitness now üôÉ i felt like shit when people called me out for dog‚Äôs weight and was real defensive also because i knew my dog was a direct reflection of my anxiety and depression i started seeking help and now i‚Äôm out and active which means so is he i am on a meal plan and now so is he üíúüíú long story long being overweight isn‚Äôt good for the pet or pet owner üòÇ
if you can afford it the hill science diet metabolic and mobility food has been fantastic for my dog she was a bit over weight and in pain at just years old it‚Äôs been months and she‚Äôs close to a healthy weight and has the same energy she did as a puppy
literally every step this dog takes is agony you are not a good dog owner op
my dogs now and shes not in the best of shape not overweight or anything but shes older now and just likes to sleep but when i catch her throwing her toys around it makes me so happy
oh mine was a weimaraner too bonny we list her two months ago at years old x
imagine letting your dog get this fat and then using it for internet points
i know a good boye when i see one and that‚Äôs definitely a good boi
glucosamine powder in food would really help s well as sprinkled green tea in food or water and maybe less fatty food good old boy
downvote these so people will stop overfeeding their dogs it s cruel and i bet that dog would look totally different had he had a proper diet old age isn t the problem here
that poor dog all that extra weight putting pressure on his joints that dog might be in some pain and walking is a painful chore a proper diet would extend that good boys life
this dog is banned from restaurants at will because he eats too much
surely this post is a celebration of dogs in their golden years although sad it‚Äôs a fact of life
awe wow that‚Äôs real old ours had lipomas all over her lumpy bumpy self she was all sass mixed with sweetness
hopefully the puppies get to keep their ears unlike mama
the insta is dtrevinoo if anyone wants to know he breeds bullies so there is tons of cuteness
thats my dad when the cindom broke and i came to this world
please stop breeding pitbulls they are dangerous animals
hopefully the breeding doesn‚Äôt result in any health problems they look cute though
are animals aware that sexual intercourse makes babies or is it more like ‚Äûwhat the hell why did these things came out of my weeweehole ‚Äú
lets hope the pups get to keep their ears i m not a fan of breeders in general but the ones that alter dogs i hate more
that‚Äôs not what i meant with my comment i meant the look on her face is saying don‚Äôt have children i support pitbulls as pets they also make great therapy dogs amp are great with kids
hey op stop breeding spend one day at an animal shelter
my apologies assumed it was yours since you posted i stand corrected
this comment section is so volitile i see more negative votes than positive can we all agree we came here out of mutual love for animals puppies are cute regardless of the circumstance of their birth
that‚Äôs it i‚Äôm gonna go out and rescue a pit bull tomorrow
her face tells us that shes gonna have a rough time dealing with the puppers
will be labeled as ‚Äúhound mix‚Äù when they go to adoption shelter
aww what sub breed of pit is this absolutely adorable
sometimes this dog wishes she lived anywhere but alabama
i hope the parents and all these puppies get spayed neutered and before people reeee at me over this look at the mother her ears are cropped only shitty owners do that
she s thinking i m never letting him touch me again
she looks like a tough as nails momma by is actually a softy and loves all her children
what are you guys doing whatever i just need to rest
impressive that s a i love you and a fuck you at the same time
ft boston whaler probibly s good boston will last forever
be careful kylie might have copyrights to that name
she s cute my cat is all like you want me to purr me yes cat i charge extra for that
my orange cat would just look at me like wtf and walk away showing me his rear end my black cat would start licking the finger and try to nibble on it
let me try no he immediately starts licking my finger
no the result of doing this to my cat would be the same as sticking your hand into a cuisenart
mine will tolerate the first boop then rip your hand off if you go in for a second
my uncle used to do the same thing to me wait a minute
what airline is this that allows dogs i like dogs but i m allergic and would not be happy in a situation like that
story time i was on a flight home after a couple of grueling weeks on the road running meetings all day every day and had taken my seat o the plane and kicked off my shoes to give my feet a rest a short time later i feel something furry plop it s butt down on them and figured out it was a seeing eye dog it was a little chilly so i giggled conspiratorially to myself and used the poor creature s ass to keep my feet warm and admittedly deliver some well deserved butt scritches to a fellow working stiff the plane takes off and i feel some motion and realize that fido has just farted directly on my feet moments later an unholy stench filled the passenger compartment the only two souls on that plane that knew who dealt it then drifted gently back to sleep
get all snuggly reach down to give little pet and loose fingers
i was flying home with my son s guide dog and he was curled up at my feet we landed a little hard and stopped a little abruptly and saxon slid right through the seats and slammed into the feet of the people in front of us i don t know who was more startled the sleeping dog or the guy who had no idea there was a dog behind him
would you care to elaborate on how she has saved you life
i ll show some love she s totally adorable she looks like she s a loyal bed snuggler cuddle bug
why do you pick the most horrid picture low quality just weird in general idk
i booped her snoots with my mouse pointy thing i do this to all the cute pups
comments and no upvotes people can be stingy my friend
everyone needs to stop the negative comments who cares this is a person telling us how much love they have for their dog appreciate it it s a dog its love has no bounds
how is it possible with today‚Äôs camera phones to only be able to come up with a pic that looks like someone tried hard to make a scary horror dog photo that‚Äôs prob why people ‚Äúshowed no love‚Äù before holy shit
boop to the snood and i get you ppl can be difficult i prefer my rescues and would choose them over any event party and such
you re a brave soul to post this from the same account and right after that tifu post good luck in future endeavors involving the ladies op
what s not to love this a sweet adorable looking pup
tfw you see blue jump into a photograph for the first time
chose a higher quality picture that doesn‚Äôt make her look like she got a lobotomy and more will like it
this is just a round about way to beg people for upvotes by trying to guilt trip them so have a downvote mom
all dogs deserve love my old neighbor loved dogs and his wife but one time he said a dogs love us the purest love do you know how to know that me no how neighbor if you locked your dog and your wife in the trunk of a car for a few hours then let them out only one of them would be happy to see you i guess it s an old saying but it was the first time i heard it he was good natured and loved to laugh before anyone asks he loved his wife high school sweethearts of i remember right
they re married and taking a nap together let them nap in peace
i have that same combo in my neighborhood orange tabby and black cat
they do not look too impressed by you maybe some treats
eh the only cats that live around where i live now are very skittish and run away the moment you get within meters of them i remember when i was taking my english courses there was a cat living in that neighbourhood that would come running to me for scritches from any distance in visual range was always fun
the black cat turned the headlights on just to let you know to move on
i loved all the cats in greece i fed many actually i fed everyone i met
that orange creamsicle cat looks just like my leeroy
ah greece the abundance of stray cats and dogs as well is crazy even outside of towns and cities
is no one gonna mention the drawing on the car window
for some reason when the black cat wakes up i think of joey and ross from z friends wanking up after their nap
no jokes i have cats and they look adsactly like these too all though i love in the uk
that black cat opening its eyes reminded me of the never ending story where the giant statues open their eyes to blast out laser beams
every time i come here every time you two don t you work
weird how i know this is greece within seconds of the vid
i truly don‚Äôt understand people that are mean to cats i know they don‚Äôt get them but the hatred i can‚Äôt figure out they‚Äôre just living their lives
i would give anything to sleep in public like that orange white cat
oh glorious zebbra butt tell me your secrets i mean cat butt
moments like these are the sugar on the corn flakes of life
my kitties look just like these they don t cuddle though
literally knew that was greece immediately fucking love that country spent almost three months living in kypseli
yes so do the bees in all countries although my bombay sang maria callas cantonese amp boulevardiere french local cats amp bees speak whatever they hear around them in their own dialect just like vivaldi s cat in venezia
the black one is going to kill you now for waking him up
those look just like my cats and they are brothers had them since they were born
i love seeing animals hanging out together where i live there s a pond where these two ducks live and they are always swimming around or having naps together it s so sweet
the first time i saw this i thought it was of the vines in the background facepalm
so since the title said every day i thought this was a compilation of op recording each day i watched this probably times in a row and i was just so confused why they were in the same exact position every day
the way the black cat opens its eyes is kinda creepy
these two are the sacred guardians of the sacred car
i love crete what a wonderful island also do you remember when greece won euros that was amazing
he s like out johs is you sorry didn t see you coming my eyes are not what they use to by how can i help you
‚Äúcome closer young one the hour grows late and the fire burns low but there is still time yet let me tell you of the days of high adventure ‚Äù

marvin is amazing can you please give him a smooch for me thank you
i feel like he‚Äôs trying to implore me to do something or not to do something
hey this is actually u mrmico ‚Äòs cat i can‚Äôt tell if your intentions are pure or not but judging in how you almost directly ripped one of his titles i‚Äôm going to assume that they are not
he s helped me find scps many times still is looking good especially considering the amount of work the scp subreddits put him through
he looks like he‚Äôs about to make me an offer i can‚Äôt refuse
i really hope that if a wizards gives him the ability to speak english he talks like marvin the martian
marvin just looks tired oh man you woke me up now i m gonna have to sleep at leaaaast extra hours now aw man so tired

this looks so much like my dunley when he was a puppy i swear his ears stayed the same size and his head just got bigger love this
this reminds me of my boyfriend‚Äôs old dog part great dane and part pyrenees looked just like this
my little girl does that too she‚Äôll even drag herself while layer out like that i love it lol
that s the awesomest stage of puppyhood when their legs grow faster their bodies for a while and they re just a bundle of extremely clumsy energy
i have a golden who was all legs as a pup she went through a very clumsy phase tripped over her legs for weeks now she is just a very tall and long doggo
she he tried to get on the cover of vogue but his her legs were toooooo long monday tuesday leg day

oh that pic made me tear up a little my cat when i was a kid looked just like that half mo and everything i didn t interact with other kids well and was scared of everything when our dog died i got really depressed because i used to talk to her so my parents got me a kitten we had to give her away when we changed countries about years later
umm cute i think the word you re looking for is regal üòº
the cat i grew up with made it to the last couple of years she was pretty sleepy but still chipper and glad to say hello she would still lie down in the sun and watch the birds fly by she was a great cat
he looks just like our kitten who is about half a year old
years old and he still has that gorgeous shiny fur you do a great job taking care of him op also stroke his chin for me
i hope he lives longer cuz my cat quite recently passed away at the age of
crazy thing is he looks exactly like my little girl cat who is only year old
you must take very good care of him i couldn‚Äôt tell he‚Äôs that old
i would have tried to get the cat out with the claw
love when people make allowances for and meals in their lives we all share this place
i would porbably try to convince the cats to get the toy i wanted
what do you mean i can t have kitteh but i fished him out fair and square
how often does this happen for a sign to be put inside
they should have an inactive one where people can go to look at the cats
you re a handsome fellow leo and i m so happy for you
god i have something in my eye this is so beautiful
when i am old n turning gray here by your side i m going to stay there s no where else i d rather be than here with you right next to me so many years that we ve been thru there s no one knows me more than you i bork you always know what for you follow me friend out the door n when is time to lay n rest is you who covers me the best together laying down to sleep is thoughts of you i ll always keep i thank my lucky stars above that i ve had you always to love ‚ù§Ô∏è
it looks like the head kept growing but the body didn‚Äôt
so adorable for some reason this reminded me not to use the wrong detergent for colored clothes
im sorry but the bottom one looks like a totally different dog black one looks thes same cute dogs tho not takig that away
we also have a basset and black lab mix for a second i thought i posted ours and forgot like yours they are besties and adorable
you left the brown one in direct sunlight for too long
why is the dog in the second picture looking hella fake
handsome ole boy is that a basset golden retriever mix
he just looks like part of the pillow in the nd pic
basset hounds are the most wonderful amazing incredible animals out there i miss mine so so much happy yours seems to be doing great
sometimes i wonder if doggos know how cute they are to us
i ve always wanted to have dogs that cuddle all my dogs like each other but i ve never caught them even touching while asleep if it was something you could train i d be working on it daily
before and after you leave a beach towel out in the sun
the beagle i think fur hasn t faded just went into an equilibrium i think again
bassadors are one of my favorite breeds so goofy looking but so cute at the same time
great pics tha k you for sharing humans could really learn from dogs
woah i didn t know their coats fade like all things but love for them will only grow
the difference in the colour reminds me of the anime vs netflix adaption memes for some reason
so wow i posted this just before i got on my flight after my wife sent me the older pic and then the one from today talk about a surprise when i got service back thank you all so much this is very special they are both yrs old and were both when my wife and i first met the black lab is now battling lymphoma and the basset is in heart failure it‚Äôs been difficult but they‚Äôre still together and each others best friend thanks again for all kindness love your puppies
serious question does the colour of a dog s fur really fade over the years
so we can all agree that the current photo shows a stuffed fake dog right
aww thank you for sharing this it s really cheered me up and given me all of the feels adorable dogs and the sweetest best friends
in the bottom pic the brown good boy looks like a bunny i love it
biggest ear i ve ever it looks like an elephant ear
i didn‚Äôt know dogs could change color so drastically over the course of their lives his mouth nose area went from complete white to soft brown
reminds me of me and my brother after years i can relate
me aww adorable bonded puppers my brain hey wanna flash back to reading where the red fern grows in elementary school
adorable dogs the bassett wins my heart i m such a hound lover and they did lighten up quite a bit
the old basset looks like a stuffed animal at first glance so precious lt
even though i am very lonely right now but still this post fills my heart with love
you re meant to use cold wash that s why they faded
awww my dogs want to kill each other how is this achieved
i love a big ole basset hound especially one going a little grey
i hope they pass at the same time so they never have to live without each other üò≠
the black dog looks like my dog who died last year üò≠
awww soooo cute my parents have a lemon basset hound interesting to see how his coat will change
it‚Äôs neat how red is always the first color to lighten with age i have a year old tricolor dog and his red markings have been gone for a long time
my family‚Äôs basset hound just died of heart failure yesterday hug yours close for me please lt
i kept going between sadness and happiness cause it took me sooo damn long to figure out if the basset was a stuffed animal in the bottom picture or not so my mind went from awww to oh no the other dog is dead
these are my doggy great nephew and niece hi jack and lolli
this is the exact reason i would never get just one dog
the old bassett looks like one of those worn out teddy bears worn out because of all the love it‚Äôs been shown over the years
this post has landed in my top favorite awwww posts
i thought in the second picture the dog was a fake because it had died and that it was a stuffed animal of the dog in the first picture and that the black dog though of it as his best buddy all the same and my ultra manly heart kinda got a little sad
this is the sweetest photo üòçüòçüòç i love the bond that animals have with us and each other ‚ù§Ô∏è
geese this brings a tear to the eye unwavering love is something truly beautiful
omg i love them üò≠üò≠ also your blanket comforter is beautiful
that basset is adorable u mean they both are but that basset hound ughhh
there beautiful better take good care of those angels
aww the basset hound reminds me of a plushie that s had so many hugs and been through the wash a few too many times adorable
everyone loves puppies but old dogs have always been more precious to me you can see the years of love and care you have had on them as well as received yourself it s pure content love it
i have a bassett hound black lab mix do you mind if i head canon these two as long lost family members
bassets and labs are just adorable ‚ô•Ô∏èi‚Äôm totally not biased because my dog just so happens to be a lab basset mix üò≠‚ô•Ô∏è
looks fade memories blur but the heart stays true these pictures are of them but also prof of your love for them too
i had a pair like that inseparable golden retriever f and a schnauzer mix m she was like his mom
bruh das another bitch right there in the second pic
fuck you you son of a bitch i promised myself i wouldn t cry with joy because i m going to have to cry later with rage over the finale of got tonight
completely irrelevant and will probably be buried but when i was growing up my aunt had two dogs tilly a basset and jake a black lab they were the sweetest dogs and i remember watching jurassic park when i was far too young and being terrified while it was also thunder storming and tilly snuggled with me all night i loved that dog so much
the world needs more heart melting love such as this lt
ahh this brought some tears all my childhood i had a black lab names lukey but he passed when i was my next pooch was a legged basset hound named willy who passed last year i wish they could have played together
that s so sweet i love seeing how nice animals can be with each other
those are some very good dogs give them pets for me üíñ üíñ
please soak in every moment you have with these babies i would give anything in the world to cuddle my gray haired faded baby one more time
my dogs snuggle just like the second picture and it s one of my favorite things of all time
dog really knows how to love and what is the real meaning of love hope humans too
i had no idea a dogs colour can fade whoa you learn something new everyday also they are the cutest
these are your animals yes if so i d like to make a request may i consume the lower one upon it s inevitable demise
he looks like he got sent through the wash too much
is that somekind basset lab mix funny looking fellowüëç
i think you washed the orange dog to much and faded it should have used cold water to keep colour in
weird does anyone know why this happens when in humans the hair just turns white it almost looks like a washed out photo filter
i know its the camera angle but damn the tan dogs head looks ridiculously huge
the last year has been so emotional over these two and their health concerns it has been extremely comforting to see and read all these sweet comments and hear stories of others old dog pairs that have passed on we will never be ready to lose mr jack basset basset hound or oodalolli ‚Äòlolli‚Äô black lab these two are the ‚Äòdogs of our lives‚Äô and knowing that it‚Äôs in the not so distant future is a tough thing to come to terms with this post becoming popular has added a bright spot in a particularly difficult month so thanks to this community for loving on our doggos and warming our hearts
never knew that dogs skin color can change so much over the years
awe that‚Äôs one of the most adorable things i‚Äôve ever seen so sweet
ugh forever the sweetest puppies my two pups are just beginning to fade if ever there where photos to make me smile and tear up in seconds
looks like a mixed german shepard to me had one that looked pretty similar a while back
i am from the cat cleaners union and this is a violation this cat looks underage
look its a giant thumper from bambi had to go there
what an amazing cuddle this bunny must be all that floof i am not certain but he looks like a flemish giant
i had to google huge rabbits to make sure that this isn t a toy
i could see a chihuahua riding one of these giants into battle
is that a small girl holding a normal sized rabbit or a normal sized woman holding a giant rabbit
i just imagine instead of the squeak they make it just plays pure bass anytime it moves
never fails to melt my heart to see how much huskies love babies
this is my human there are many like him but this one is mine ‚ô•Ô∏è
this is wonderful and beautiful end with little boy just snoozing next to that sweet patient girl
wish i could upvote this a million times animals watching over babies is my weak spot
there s so much love in that dog s eyes it s so touching
i love how dogs instinctively know that they need to be more gentle with babies
love how she s a little bit skeptical at the start but by the end she s all in on this new pack member lt
pups loving babies is the realest kind of love they expect nothing in return they just want to watch out for their humans
is there a browser extension that will automatically hide baby and dog posts op s know what they re doing farming karma and outrage these threads are always spicy and controversial
when i heard his voice i was like isn t this millperthusky
it s cute af moments like this that make parents forget all of the sleepless nights and bad days and yes that baby is a unit
those two are gonna make so much trouble together as that kid grows up i can t wait for the gifs
the way dogs just naturally take to babies is fascinating
i love how the baby fell over after his support left like wait how do i stay up on my own again
they have a channel on youtube milperthehusky on youtube cant link using mobile
i wish i lived that too when i was baby never had a dog my mom doesnt want it
i dont remember but this is from a yourube channel that owns two big huskies and this theyre son
wow i scrolled through and haven t seen one comment about how they shouldn t let a dog near the baby and so on where are you guys
that is beyond adorable and when the pup butted her head against her human at the end d‚Äôawwwwwwwww
my youngest is and my doodle has only recently realized the baby s valuable snack to dog ratio
gummy baby smiles make me want to have another one omg
ah yes the dog was the cute one here not the fatass fetus thing that the good dog decided to hang out with
its seems to me that huskies seem to be a step up above other dogs when it comes parenting their hoomans they literally wont leave their sides
just a note not a siberian husky it s a malamute you can tell from the ears
"the doggo knows that kid will get him smackos down the road l
ong con"
why do puppies and kittens get to be so cute but babies look like lumpy old potatoes
kid looks like the guy from the beginning of full metal jacket
balto here ready to protect the baby even if he needs to cross the arctic tundra to do it
that kid had teeth at like four months old i‚Äôm very sorry for mom
oh gosh this is so cute but seeing such a big dog with such a delicate baby gives mr undue anxiety i understand that hes probably a calm soft boi tho so sweet ‚ù§
this makes me want to change my life and have babies
i just hope the husky doesn‚Äôt pass before the kid‚Äôs too young to remember him
i ll accept the downvotes but posts like this are fucking stupid you don t know any dog that well one wrong move and the dog could accidentally kill that baby and it wouldn t be the dogs fault it s the fucking parents and people taking pictures of this shit no i don t give a shit about your anecdotal story of your saint of a dog yes i know the dog has to acclimate and get use to the new person in the house but that doesn t mean shit like this
best part of it that husky would die before it let anything harm that kid once when my daughter was a baby my wife was yelling on the phone at one of her siblings while the kid laid on the couch the baby started crying when my wife went to pick her up our husky who was about months got in between them and growled at the wife he thought she was mad at the kid wouldn‚Äôt let her near the baby until she relaxed that was almost years ago to this day he‚Äôll do anything to get near her if she cry‚Äôs and won‚Äôt let anyone touch her if they‚Äôre angry
you make that little guy‚Äôs day they grow fast cherish every moment
this baby is so fat it makes me think it s parents are fat üòÇ
i wonder if dogs watch human babies grow up and think what is taking you so long
when my mom was carrying me our neighbor s husky kept getting out of the yard and breaking her bind chain to come be by my mom she did this so much that the neighbor eventually gave her to my mom saying it was best i don t remember her husky i know generic much because she died before i was two but my mom said she d never leave her side while she was pregger and wouldn t leave mine after i was born dogs are awesome
these are always heartwarming and i m glad to see stories of others who grew up with dogs i only had my grandparents dog until but sugar white german shepherd was basically my nanny for those years as an adult i m glad my family and i went back to raising the next generation with dogs
what‚Äôs the sub that‚Äôs about questionable ages or this baby‚Äôs face says baby‚Äôs body says baby
our son and dog were like this completely inseparable
every once in a while it suddenly occurs to me how amazing it is that we let these animals into our homes and families the level of trust on both sides blows my mind i m so happy that we share our lives with our pets the way we do
i think i may have just fallen in love this was so beautiful to watch thank you for sharing
that s such a cute and chubby baby i want to pinch his cheeks
i so wish i had video of me growing up with my pets this is adorable
the dogs like what the woof kind of puppy is this its been a year and its still the same
why does this baby look like a toddler version of potential history
what a great dog ours just threw endless tantrums and walked over the baby if he was in her way small dog and refused to acknowledge that he existed because she is the baby and will not be replaced years later same attitude towards her human baby brother
eww god please don t let your dog lick your baby s face
oh it s that kid that always wants to chew on doggo s ear adorable duo right there
i trusted my dog but if he made some of the faces the husky makes like around i would tell people strangers mostly to better back off but the funny thing if an adult would touch and even just slightly brush his ears he would squeel but when kids grabbed them like this baby does nothing happened oh and small women i miss you boy
there is so much evil in the world idk this really made my day these are the type of things i want to see
the last part of the video where the beautiful doggo rested his head on the baby ‚ù§Ô∏è
at first he s like gt i must proteck and then he s all like gt i no sleep for days kill me
that‚Äôs the happiest baby ever always a big smile so cute
the facial expressions on that baby are fucking hilarious
its milperthhusky on instagram in case anyone is interested
my family watched my aunts rottweiler for a few months my sister would walk him and take care of him i didn‚Äôt like her walking him alone because i thought he would be too strong for her if he got into a fight with another dog one night we‚Äôre watching movies in the living room and otto the rot was on the floor with us me and my sister are talking and i smack her with a pillow i had she screamed like i hurt her but it was a pillow and she was being funny otto jumps up gets a few inches from me and lets out a deep growl i know he wouldn‚Äôt have done anything because i‚Äôve known him since he was a pup but he did not like me hitting my sister i told him to lay down and he backed off but you could tell he didn‚Äôt like anyone getting near my sister i felt better about her walking him after he had her back big time we‚Äôre very lucky to have dogs
i know this is probs a repost but it would be so cool to have a clip from every month of the life the baby and dog share together all the karma for the bestest doggo goodgurl
he she can officially say that he she was raised by wolves
she is millie from milperthusky i love their channel
cute pair lt looks like that kid will treat its doggo with love
very nice to see that your dogs are gentle around the babies have seen very many dogs who want to play with the baby or believe that they are being attacked when the baby plays with their ears or something similar did you train the dog beforehand or is she just very gentle naturally
this baby is a stark has a direwolf he‚Äôs the prince that is promised wait wrong thread
i don t really think it s a good idea to put such a dangerous beast next to a poor baby like that did you see how it grabbed his ear
for some reason i look at this baby s face and imagine that he s going to be a very friendly person in the future he just looks like a good person
how many times must this be reposted everyday i see it and love it but my god let me breath
what makes it was is when the dog dies while the child grows
we don t deserve dogs as humans but this little human looks worthy
this kid is going to have the biggest existential crisis in about years lol
omg that is the cutest thing ever i‚Äôm all warm n fuzzy
the laughs of his her father are overwhelmingly wholesome
it s crazy how just accepting and patient the dogs are of the young boy
this is too sweet thank you for posting it s made my day
oh god this made me cry i remember growing up since before i had a memory that we had this beautiful white dog that protected me from stray dogs and once fought a pack of wild stray dogs while i was walking home too late he was the most beautiful good boy ever and it hurts so much that i cannot remember more memories of him he died after that attack but i got away its one of the only memories i have of him i was maybe four years old i remember my cousin an unloved and heartless asshole who poured a bucket of freezing cold water on my good boy in the middle of winter i cried so hard as a kid knowing he was freezing out there god i hope there s a heaven where my mom and my doggy will welcome me one day
dang if why‚Äôs my dog have to be such a neurotic mess
baby needs to start sweating to the oldies call richard simmons
hey quick question what do you do about the dog hairs
omg i‚Äôm getting really emotional thinking about how much this doggo loves their human
the baby looks like a future highschool football bully remindme in years
years in pediatrics and i have to say that is one of the most adorable babies i ve ever seen holy shit just beautiful and that pup what a sweetheart
i ve said it before and i ll say it again every child should be raised with a dog unless they re very allergic i guess
sorry if this question sounds stupid but is this a husky the reason i asked is because i recognized most of the huskies have blue iris and a little black dot as the pupil very seldom i see with both iris and pupil being black this is because of mixed breed or something
god i hope if i have kids they can have this kinda relationship with there furry friend
it s interesting to see the dog become more comfortable with the baby when he grows up in the beginning he s sorta like boss what is this tiny fake human and then he s like okay yeah human puppy i can deal with this d
omg that baby falling over i can t stop laugh crying
is that augustus from charlie and the chocolate factory
the blue tracksuit at gave me a weird optical illusion of the baby being crudely greenscreened into the picture

bowser has to be the absolute best name i ve heard for a dog suits him kinda wished the bearded king was also named bowser
i had no idea a dog could rename a human let alone adopt him
tell him to stay away from princess peach and then mario might give him pats
isn t it illegal to own black people cool dog though
can dog bowser replace doug bowser as new nintendo ceo
i don t think it s allowed to adopt black people anymore
shouldn‚Äôt he be running nintendo i don‚Äôt think reggie approves
you cant adopt the president of nintendo of america the heck also tell him to let mario and luigi go please
be sure to feed him well take him out for walks and make him shave that beard good boy
how many times has he already kidnapped the princess
is he ok with flying or is he going to drive with you
he looks excited to move on to his next adventure awesome pic

as an added bday present get toys and stuff for gravy that s a good name for a brown cat is the kitten brown or the one in the pic
i dressed up as doc for halloween a few years ago but i wasn t nearly as cool as emmett adorable
are you sure that isn‚Äôt an artificial created being born of rick sanchez and jimmy buffet‚Äôs dna
when this baby hits mph you are going to see some serious shit
gotta love christopher lloyd he nailed it in bttf and he was also great on monkeys
aww so nice to have such a memorable moment love it how he s smiling ear to ear but his fists are still clenched haha
doc went back to take a pic with himself as a kid just for internet points
is it a coincidence that christopher lloyd was in the bttf and that he‚Äôs been years old for the past years
i thought your kid was dressed as rick from rick and morty
does his kid look like macaulay culkin from the first two home alone movies to anyone else
i love pictures of kids who don t yet know how to smile naturally those big awkward goofy attempts at a smile crack me up
what a badass picture to use to celebrate your cake day
is anyone else disgusted by this old dude having a kid when he has foot in the grave
he voices the hacker on the pbs kids show cyber chase i just love hearing his voice while my kids learn
i have a son named emit and he has the same outfit minus the lab coat haha
first time i have ever seen more than emmett in a room and thats coming from an emmett
such an amazing picture this will be one of the highlights of his life i m so happy for you
soo i m a little drunk shit housed is that really christopher lloyd with his son named emmett as in emmett brown if so there is hope for humanity actually now i refuse to believe anything else this is the most wholeso thing i have seen today and if you don t like that then well fuck you and the horse you rode in on
omg i d be stoked the just showed back to the future in a theater near by last week on one of their throw back days the theater was packed it was great
so does the kid have any idea who the guy is or is this some weird vicarious thing
there was an older game called toonstruck that featured chris lloyd some of my fondest childhood memories are from playing that game with my cousins i m glad to see youth these days still looking up to him
am i the only one who thought that christopher lloyd had a year old kid
man i was at megacon those pictures are so expensive worth it for the kids though
my wife and i just had a new son and named him emmett nice name choice op
i just flat out love christopher lloyd camp nowhere man camp nowhere
ok not gonna lie for a minute i thought you were doc brown and was kinda confused on how old you had a kid at
my wife and i are expecting our nd a boy and emmett is on the short list jury is still out that s about all i have to say about that
love i‚Äôm actually watching the psych episode clues that he guest starred in
could emmett be any more excited cute kid one of my favorite actors in the world lt
your son looks like macaulay culkin from home alone a little either that or i m high as fuck
sorry if someone‚Äôs already said this but his face kinda looks like kevin‚Äôs from home alone
emmet was the name of ross and rachel‚Äôs kid on friends
okay it‚Äôs late and i‚Äôm incredibly stoned and i thought an old man adopted a little boy and i was so fucking confused now i can‚Äôt stop laughing because i love back to the future and i‚Äôm amazed that i didn‚Äôt recognize anything in this photo and feel like a fuckin idiot
he is both terrified and excited at the same time lol
big day for the kid or the dad who is obsessed enough with a movie to name his kid emmet and get him to watch the movies
so i know he is named after doc brown rick from rick and morty is ultimately based on doc brown but that kid looks a lot like rick as a little kid lol glad he got to meet him gotta enjoy them while we have them around still
the look on emmett s face oh my god best picture ever
my kid is too young to know it yet but he was my belly while i watched bttf on oct his original first name was robert and got changed to emmett
god damn christopher lloyd is up there i m glad he s out there doing his thing but i feel sad to see him so old as well
this is the most adorable thing i have seen all day
your kids adorable i like that he looks like he is being held hostage by christopher lloyd also they have similar ears which i guess means you probably have similar ears are you christopher lloyd s son you don t have to answer that mr lloyd i m just going to pretend that you are
hey morty i turned myself into a kid again morty i‚Äôm tiny rick
this is that rick and morty looking throwback young rick with an older rick
i love how your son clinched his fists in excitement one can tell he was stoked
look at how excited he is those tiny clenched fists
oh man i‚Äôm so high i thought you were christopher lloyd and you were posting this on reddit what an age difference
yay for him is your son named emmett after doc brown or is that just part of why he identifies with the character
megacon i didn t get to see him or michael j fox or steven amell or tyler hoechlin i did quite literally see john barrowman i did however get my photo taken with david tennant and in my mind that makes up for all i didn t do
the huge grin and how hard he s squeezing his hands is so cute pure excitement and joy
emmett til would like to speak to you from beyond the grave
my name s emmett and i ve only met one other but not with the same spelling that s so cool
i have been staring at this for two minutes thinking how wonderful it was that christopher lloyd decided to adopt a child who looked up to him so much and that was why it was such an important day for them then i checked the comments you re a good dad op
same face i made on my th birthday when i met katee sackhoff username relevant lol
just learned that his grandfather was a business tycoon and one of the founders of texaco üí∞
good to see an old college friend on the front page üòÄ
megacon orlando i m out in california and missed it this year and i m incredibly jealous i m from jacksonville and when megacon is in orlando i always try to go especially this year because it had the bttf cast and david tennant
this is amazing bttf is my favorite movie of all time though part of that may be the nastalgia as it and it s sequals were two of the few movies my grandmother had and i binged them every time i stayed with her top gun homeward bound and and titanic we re the others
more about op forcing his bullshit fandom on his kid
i thought christopher lloyd named his son emmett and made him a mini me
did anyone else this this was christopher lloyd s account and that was his kid christ i m an idiot
i ve never seen bttf and i am not well versed in any pop culture thought you were the man in the picture was confused
when i first saw this picture in the thumbnail i thought the kid was a grandma and the guy was like and a half feet tall
i don‚Äôt have my glasses on and didn‚Äôt recognize who was in the photo i spent more than a few minutes trying to figure out why the father was so old and exactly what was happening
must be a bit painfull for him as he had no kids irl great pic
is it weird that my favorite role i ve seen him in is in the pagemaster he s perfect for eccentric characters and i dearly want to see more of him in that type of role any recommendations beyond bttf of course also lil emmett looks so happy d i m glad he had a good time op
look at the complete emptiness of devastation in lloyd s eyes and he meets the parent of a kid named after one of his characters
i thought this post was from christopher lloyd and it was him announcing his son to reddit i see i was mistaken
that kid looks like he‚Äôs going to invent a quantum computer and break out of the simulation
he is he should not have any children younger than yo what was he thinking
it took an embarrassingly long time to figure out that you aren‚Äôt christopher lloyd it‚Äôs possible i‚Äôm a bit too high happy cake day
lot of posts about christopher lloyd and back to the future but honestly i wanna know how old you are and how old the kids mom is was there any trouble making this little dude your sperm was able to produce a child what‚Äôs it like being an older father i have a lot of questions you can dm me if you want
i thought it was dangerous for someone to see their other self in a different time
well if you have another kid i d go with great scott
the kid looks the dad looks late s early s honestly thought it was his grandparent
also saw him in i am not a serial killer recently he did amazingly
when i was a kid i was obsessed like so many with bttf emmett brown was like a silver screen grandfather to me shortly after watching bttf i remember asking my dad what the guy who played doc brown was up to i have no clue why my dad said this but he told me that christopher lloyd was dead now i‚Äôm not religious or anything but i believed this and almost a decade later i found out he was still alive that is about as close to a second coming i think i‚Äôll ever get
look i love christopher lloyd and the kid looks great but i m my oldest is and my youngest is i know i couldn t do it all over again at my age now if i had a ton of money to hire staff to help well
met him once he picked his nose before shaking my hand
i had a weird feeling today that he would die soon and then i opened reddit and saw this and now i‚Äôm worried it‚Äôs some sign from the universe
it s a fantasy people there are no rules in telling the story of how marty and doc are friends
is it wrong for my first thought of your kid was a mini guy fiery i only noticed bttf after i saw the comments
your son liking bttf and wanting to dress up as doc cool him also wanting to meet lloyd great but there‚Äôs something so so weird about his name being emmet
i dont understand the meaning of this pic why is it a big day can anybody plz explain
its kinda selfish to have a child at that age but whatevz
you guys are cute amp cool wish i had such a pics with my old timer kids hairstyle reminds me of grindelwald and thats amazing
holy shit i was sat here for minutes trying to work out what was going on cool photo
this is such a wonderful picture it truly warms my heart
looking like the child version of rick of rick and morty
i was so confused for a second then i was like ohh yess of course back to the future üòÇ
so took me minutes to realize the title is op saying this is a picture of christopher lloyd and op s son right op is not christopher lloyd confusing
this kid s face expression looks like hahaa twitch emote
i ve got a photo that i had taken christopher lloyd at a con this one time a friend who had never seen bttf was visiting saw it and commented that i really looked like my dad couldn t stop laughing for a solid ten minutes it s now a running joke that my dad s a time traveller side note i know we all like to think we could play it cool when we meet our heroes when i showed up for the photo i could barely blurt out a hello cha cha smooth
is it bad i recognized him from malcom in the middle first
now that we ve cleared up the confusion about who the kid is and that op is not christopher lloyd can we please discuss the fact that christopher lloyd is dressed up as george carlin
looks like little rick has been initiated by old rick into the council of ricks
didn t realize who the father was at first and thought the kid was dressed as rick sanchez
it s interesting how you can almost tell people s age by the comments for this post
"girl ziva or luna
boy thor or baldr
or just cutiepie ‚ù§Ô∏èüò¨"
sparta then you could say this is sparta when you introduce it
she looks like she has a crown on her side so freya or juno
that name made me laugh out loud what a great dog name
my kitty pancake and i say hi ü§ó ps my pancake says you have the best name in the world üòÅ

i thought from the thumbnail i was aboit to see a harry guy with his shirt off
you ever have one hiss at you from the shadows in the middle of the night not cute
until you try to evict one from your basement then you learn they are able to summon evil from dark places that mankind was never meant to see
if only the pig checked it‚Äôs phone and made an ‚Äúahh ‚Äù face before that dramatic turn
for this video and more check out kittenxlady on instagram
the pig just used his abs that s all all bacon skid
piggy had just claimed he could stop on a dime trot trot trot stop just like that
reminds me of kylo ren skidding in the last jedi to see is rey is there
ive held a pig in my arms once i have it printed on a bag now
when you forget why you entered a room for a second
when my mom catches me running to the kitchen at am üòî
i‚Äôve seen a lot of babies today but this this was cute
otherwise known as how i enter every room with sanded wood floors when i have socks on
he was definitely up to no good and realized he was spotted another time human another time
is there a youtube channel or instagram for this pig
i hate when piglets make a sudden stop and turn without signaling to the traffic
look at joshua s pretty little tippy tappy toes omg check out the kitten lady on instagram and youtube she provides the best foster cat content and information out there and is such an incredible advocate and rescuer of kittens and obviously other awesome animals too fostering kittens is the funnest cutest way to save lives seriously
for a minute there i thought it was going to do the moon walk
why is this video watermarked by two different people who don‚Äôt own it it‚Äôs from iamthecatphotographer ‚Äòs instagram
when you re quietly heading to the kitchen to sneak midnight snacks then suddenly hear your mom coming
when your internet connection is horrible and your download stops
reminds me of when you are walking to get something and you forget what it is you are walking to get for a second but then you remember again üòÇ
oh you re approaching me instead of running away you re coming right towards me
la la la stop did i have my daily belly rubs no no definitely not yet
i couldn t help but hear the breaking sound effect in my head
when you forgot something to bring and you realize that u already put it on your bag
its skid was actually satisfying to watch i can t stop replaying it
if i saw that running across my living room floor i‚Äôd stomp on it until it was nothing but a little brown stain i quote
all i could hear was jontron and iiiiiiii holy shit will always love yoooou
wait a minute did i sent that papers to my lawyer oh well
all these videos of cute pigs and cows makes it hard to remain a meat eater
hybrid between a james bond title clip and that confused pig sheep dog movie
stop wait a minute fill my trough put some slip in it take a sip sign the check julio get the tractor
when you re just out of the house and you realize you forgot tour phone
thought the video started buffering when the pig stopped
i showed this to my husband and his response was ‚Äúme when i see the booty‚Äù
anyone have a link where i can download this with audio this video really got me out of the dumps after a shitty start to the week
it stopped because it saw the person filming and wanted to say hello
awwww what cuteness i have stumbled across this morning lt
if i had a girl like that i‚Äôd be excited to see her every chance i got too
how could you leave that beautiful pup for three whole years
this is the first time i‚Äôve genuinely smiled all day it‚Äôs p m thank you
you‚Äôve spent your whole life a broad ba doom tsh i‚Äôll see myself out
my heart breaks for that pup if my parents abandoned me as a child so they could travel for years i guess i‚Äôd be excited to see them too it‚Äôs amazing how loyal dogs truly are
you could power the eastern sea board on that dog s excitement
wonderful what made you want to leave then come back
why do dogs do this cycle charge thing when they re happy cats just kind of jump on you and stay there
dang op years is a long time imagine all the treats you could of gave that pupper luckily i can take mine with me when i go visit my native country lots of treats and love
hate to be the jerk but you can t leave for years and call him my dog
we got a dog to help with my brother‚Äôs depression i didn‚Äôt really like dogs before but i‚Äôm in love with my dog and other dogs now i don‚Äôt know what i‚Äôm going to do once i have to move out of the state in a few years
aww i am a little surprised no one peed on the floor
how dare you post such a thing without sound i need to hear my happy dog squeaks
‚Äúhec‚Äù ‚Äúhec hecing hec‚Äù ‚Äúmy hooman is bacc‚Äù ‚Äúi lic mlem‚Äù
my dog acts like this after not seeing me for three hours
that s got to be an unbelievable feeling my cats wouldn t care if i didn t wake up tomorrow morning i love them anyway
wow is part of your house in the conservatory glass outside that‚Äôs very cool
pretty much how any dog would react nothing about these posts are special
please tell me you will never leave the doggo again
years yeah i‚Äôm pretty sure your dog thought you were dead and is freaking out understandably can you imagine losing a dog and it coming back after whole years that dog can not believe its luck üòÇüò≠
after years it still doesn t forget you that was amazing
this is how my dog reacts to not seeing me in a week cant have dogs in my apartment complex and him being left alone for hours of the day is also bad
three years is a long time where are you from and where d you go
if you spent three years away from the dog then it isn t your dog who does it live with it s their dog
this is exactly how my dog behaves when i see her after days so heartwarming
man i hope my dog is that happy to see me when i finish my enlistment here in okinawa years months to go
dogs are the most lovable and trustworthy person same happened with me when i returned from abroad and that moment made me cried
had malfunction in my eyes something wet came out happy for you and your doggo
not sure why you would leave your dog for three years is it even your dog any more
but why did you leave him behind he must have been depressed i know my dogs missed my mom a whole bunch when she was a broad for months they stopped eating well
when i came back home to my dog after a year he was like hi cool you re back i got stuff to chew on bye
cute doggo but all i can think of is why is your christmas tree still up
i pretty sure that if you leave your dog minutes alone he she will be as excited
i read this as my dog seeing me for the first time after i ve spent years a board and let me tell you i was so confused but this is honestly so sweet thabm youdjjsj
he seems to be nosing your crotch a lot was it a long flight
this is how my dog acts when i get home from the grocery store
my god that s my dog after i m gone to work for hours if i were gone for years she d probably explode
if you leave your dog for years is it really your dog
my dog seeing me for the first time after i ve spent hours running errands
omg how could you not have visited your dog in years üò≠
i m an idiot and was scrolling too fast so i read it as my seeing eye dog for the first time after i ve spent years abroad and i was like hmmm
wonderful video but no sound is also a tiny little bit disappointing
dude if you think about it he s been gone a while years of his life
my dog has the same reaction when i leave for minutes
while the gif was loading i thought it was going to be a plot twist where op was standing there encouraging her dog to come over and then the camera pans over to the dog looking at her suspiciously
this is what my dog does everyday it s cute but boy does it get old fast
you why were you even years abroad i see no reason to not be able to visit in those years
i ve heard that dogs don t have time awareness is this true so it could have been years
my dog does this when i walk out the front door for seconds
is it just me or is it weird that i saw this minutes after it was posted
your yr old boy looks just like my yr old such a handsome man
brownie maybe i ve always liked the name terra if it is a female
such a good boy d hope he has many more healthy years to come
i m buddy the dog yeah one night i showed up was wandrin around i was one lonely pup you tried to find humans i lived with before but they made me feel they don t want me no more so no luck you say that nobody was found well guess what my friends i am one lucky hound i decided to stay cause you said that i could n i am so thankful you made my life good ‚ù§Ô∏è
my friend s parents had a badly wounded and skinny black lab limp up to them one day when they decided to do something unusual and sit outside the garage to watch the sun rise on a friday his leg was torn wide open either barbed wire or an animal fight got him good they cleaned and bandaged the wound while he laid on a rug they put in the garage when they were done they gave him food and water and left the garage opened he ate and then slept for almost days once the weekend was done they took him to a vet that is happy to volunteer time for strays people take in they said the wound looks to be healing well so they just cleaned and bandaged it up again he ended up being an incredibly smart and protective dog he d walk carrying his own leash my friend s mom somehow snapped her acl one day in the shower and he got to her then walked with her leaning on his back to the phone for an old lab and their hip problems that had to be extra tough he had a strong hatred for anyone wearing a hoodie for some reason take the hood of and you were a friend again one day an old friend of theirs showed up and he went a bit crazy and took him to the ground by the neck as soon as he walked inside he didn t do any damage at all just made it very apparent he didn t want them there just held him behind the front door with all his hair standing up on his back a bit later a syringe fell out of the guy s pocket he didn t have a medical reason to have that i got a lot of stories of that dog like when i was dog sitting for them locked myself out and he opened the door for me sadly he passed away a few years ago from an unknown infection that antibiotics didn t help but he had the crap spoiled out of him while he was there
this dog looks exactly like my dog who recently just passed no joke his name was buddy too he was the best friend anyone could ask for love him forever every day is precious
he looks like a sweet and gentle soul so glad you guys found each other
he is just wonderful very sweet lucky dog lucky you
dogs know good people and he chose the best what a sweetie
so the previous owners never tried to find him again
are you in la area you dog looks just like ours and the same age haha
so sweet my old girl cybil showed up in our yard in in a very rural neighbourhood she appeared to be less than a year old and at the awkward high energy undisciplined teenage stage we did everything possible to find her owners but after weeks we figured she was dumped she s geriatric now mostly sleeps has bad eyesight and very deaf but is dearly loved whoever dropped her off thank you
i also found a dog years back jack russell terrier and couldnt find the owner i couldn‚Äôt take care of a dog so i gave her to my cousin and they took care of her for over a year but then she ran away one day and never to be seen hopefully she found a new owner that took care of her
are you anywhere near texas he looks just like my dog and we always dream of finding his litter mates
how do you know he d been trying to find his previous owners
laugh with me buddy jest with me buddy don t let her get the best of me buddy
every dog my girl has ever rescued was initially obedient and then became a jelous bastard that tests my patience i wish a good rescue was all it took but not all rescues integrate well with other dogs in the family
ollie been searching for you everywhere amp x b amp x b amp x b nah i m just kiddin
i m so proud of him even though i don t even know what are his accomplishments
he didn‚Äôt need to go home he was home when he came to your house
the boi seems to have made a good move give him belly rubs
awww your parents are gems buddy lokks like a very sweet loving amp wise pup he knows where he belongs lt
this picture just makes me smile thank you for brightening up my day üòÅ
way way better than docked i feel so bad when i see them with the itty bitty ears
i spent way to long wondering how he grew back half an ear than realized it was folded super darn cute
love the folded in half ear floppy ears are the best
i think it s the st time i see one with full ears and i love it one ear salute ftw
beautiful puppy who is rocking a set of adorable ears
i hope i wasnt the only one thinking he had lost a piece of his ear in the first one
and when you‚Äôre walking them they flap like butterflies
agreed great looking pup safe to say he still has his tail as well
that s quite the beauty you have there give the big chest a rub from this internet stranger
i don‚Äôt know why there isn‚Äôt more of a movement to make docking ears amp tails when there‚Äôs so much furor over declawing cats natural is so much cuter it suits their faces better
ok he can t really be that cute i think i ll have to hold onto him for a while just to make sure you wouldn t mind right
can confirm neighbor has one passed them on jog today he received pets on his ears
pitbulls are ugly change my mind lmao i‚Äôm pretty sure this comment will be downvoted to hell
i don t get docking them they don t look good at all although i m sure its for other stupid made up reasons i love the kind ve dog ears that flip over tho and u gotta put em back
i hope this is the image that comes up on google what a beautiful doggo
my pups ear does the same thing i call it earectile dysfunction
cropped ears are so terrible people do it all the time in my state and it sickens me it should be outlawed unless its done purely for health reasons and the vet has proof of reason why for any dog not just pits boxers shepherds great danes dobermans
the fact that people spend money on unnecessary procedures is beyond me let me spend money to chop my dogs tail off or do it myself or just don t do it or don t have a pet ¬Ø „ÉÑ ¬Ø
impossibly cute pibble this is not acceptable you‚Äôre not allowed to have a pitty this gorgeous while i don‚Äôt
when i first looked at the picture on the left i thought the dogs ear was missing in the one spot
my pit has them too love when my mom calls him stiff ears lol
love them floppy flops i adore when people leave their ears natural same as on dobermans too super cute
yes yes i have never been with getting their ears trimmed
we project our human values onto other species it s simply not there
awwwww that curled ear looks exactly like the chunk a pitbull took out of my dogs ear huh
for a second there it looked like there was a chunk bitten out of the dog on the lefts right ear
everyone asked me why i did not crop my pits ears my response is always the same how about i cut the tips of your ears off and see how it feels my nikita has her tail too sure it s like a whip but you just get used to not putting cups near the edge of the coffee table
he‚Äôs got a ‚Äúi‚Äôm not sure you know what you‚Äôre talking about‚Äù look i love it
are pits prone to ear issues my mutts a mix with big floppy ears but she always seems to be bothered by her ears and one time the vet said she had an ear infection so we did an ear flush and drops for a while but even after that cleared up she still seems to always scratching rubbing at her ears
where i live it‚Äôs illegal to crop ears and tails because there is no good reason to why it‚Äôs necessary it‚Äôs only legal if it‚Äòs for medical reasons it makes me so sad to see really cute dogs with cropped ears and or tails and people defending it with some ludicrous explanation
it s super weird that you people never use the name pitbull like it s some forbidden word or something
i‚Äôll never understand why people feel the need to clip pibble ears or crop dobermans ears like honestly how can people justify that they have naturally beautiful ears
i m in nz and i ve never seen a dog with cropped ears until i saw it on reddit i thought it must be a us thing but i could be wrong
why does everyone on reddit call pittbulls pitties i had never heard that term before i joined reddit
beautiful awesome pup and yes to natural question for fellow redditors what about the dew claw do you think they should be removed we recently adopted a puppy oh my that‚Äôs another post and she still has her dew claws all except one of our previous pups and adult adoptions have had them removed i may totally be wrong please tell me but i was taught to believe that keeping the dew claw was always a risk that they might tear it etc your thoughts just to be clear i have no intentions of asking a vet to do anything now
my girl s floppy ears crack me up all the time and her tail is so expressive can t imagine her without either i mean you can t leave drinks on the coffee table with her around but it s a small price to pay
they don t stay like this after they get older though
i got a doberman puppy and his previous owners cropped his ears it‚Äôs literally the worst part about him he is an amazing dog with dumb ears because some eejit wanted their dog to look like batman he literally the only dog i‚Äôve ever owned in years that didn‚Äôt like his ears rubber i love grabbing an ear in each hand a rubbing my thumb on the flaps of their ears and he hates it and it makes me sad the good news is that my other dog doesn‚Äôt mind taking his ear rubs and he loves to get his chin scratched more than any dog i‚Äôve ever known so there‚Äôs still a happy ending to the story just a happy ending with really dumb ears
so that s what my little kita is going to grow into i ve been trying to find pictures but it s been a struggle
slightly less aero dynamic when chasing down children
gotta watch out for those lunks with their big floppy ears though they do sometimes get them in trouble mine was shaking his head next to the coffee table one day and whacked his ear which turned into a sub dermal hematoma and required surgery now his ear is all limp and jacked up and i still find blood on the walls ceiling in random places from the recovery period of him having drainage tubes and deciding to shake his head laughs
luckily ear cropping is actually illegal where i live i always feel bad when i see a pooch like that
i m curious why do people crop pit bulls ears so much is it a health concern
i love pibbles and amstaffs pibbles are one of the breeds with breed specific legislation in australia which makes me sad cause they‚Äôre less dangerous than my dachshund she‚Äôs more likely to try and eat you than a pibble is
i legit have no idea why anyone would lop off such adorable ears
well floppy ears can get infected quite a bit easier as told to me by my vet i love my dogs ears and tails so i don‚Äôt do it and she just told me way to help make sure they don‚Äôt get infected eat rinse mainly
protip hold the treats behind their head a bit so when they look up and back you get perfectly standing ears then sing i believe i can fly
love love love this my pitty has those big flippy ears and i can t get enough of them
while this subject is here can we maybe not have our first reaction to be an ass to someone who has a dog with a docked tail or cropped ears often they arent the ones who did it they may have adopted the dog from the shelter already like that or recieved the dog from someone else who had it done
so are rottie tails if it s not for a medical reason it shpuuld be banned
i am actually i get irritated when people make dumbass assumptions or inject themselves into topics they probably know nothing about most likely if they add nothing to the conversation they re just saying something stupid to get a chuckle for fake internet points
also while we re changing the world and everything stop cutting up baby boy penis too thanks
we lost our boy who looked just like that two months ago beautiful pitt
why people cut their dog s ears tails tho aesthetics i always thought it was because of dog fighting
oh no i chose to specifically comment on selected posts what atrocities
while i hold no actual prejudices against any breed it‚Äôs amazing how much more approachable they seem with natural ears
our pit bull‚Äôs ears are natural as well and they are adorable too she‚Äôs beautiful
no you need to mutilate them so that they look tough s
look at that belleh lt ponies can be ornery so if he wants me to call him a fierce stallion i will comply
i don t know why but the longer i stare at this picture the more i think the appropriate sound to go with it is a fart
i love everything about this photo this stallion holds the confidence i desire to have one day
something something little sebastian parks and rec give me karma
am i the only one who thought this cute lil kitty had his mouth open o
i have that exact same blanket on the floor for my dog üòÇ maybe it‚Äôs just not meant to be a human blanket lol
i m having real cute aggression right now i just want to squish the kitty
congratulations on many years of snuggles and goodbye to sleeping in mornings
at first glance the preview image looks like an arm and hand held up with half of the skin ripped off
this little cutie just makes me smile lt ugh thanks for posting and sharing the cuteness
looks like he belongs in a south park episode with that look
what is this sorcery the cat doesn t even seem to mind
wtf it s like the pretty popular girl in rd grade when you re playing kittens at recess
wow those eyes could stare into my soul beautiful kitty
no offense but i wanted to ask the cat lovers what exactly is it that they look for when keeping cats as pets for us dog lovers we gain a lovely and faithful companion which i believe is not true when it comes to cats in pretty sure they are loyal to food and companionship is close to
i want that bow and i want that cat do you do free shipping
those dilated pupils scream im about to fuck up your shit
this kitty looks like she is doing chores around the house all day
wow looking so cute in a pink bow her eyes are love wanna kiss her
i would slap somebody in front of their momma for this cat
its like the same picture that i saw last week how can cats be so similar o
this is the best post i have seen on reddit all week
all she needs is a pink halter top and skin tight denim shorts
is that the cat from shrek puss in boots now puss in pretty pink bow zomg zomg sequel
big pupils khajeet is humiliated human your jugular is exposed
i am not subbed here why did i got this notification but i accept it and it brought something cute in my life this is cute
o gosh the eyes are so cute it can make anyone aww d adorable
as soon as i saw this i was thinking the kitty had a toothache
a living being a toy good thing you don t have to face these questions you paid the money for this soul so it is your thing and you may do as you please with it
first time posting here i think what‚Äôs the equivalent for ‚Äúwho‚Äôs a good boy‚Äù
cute reminds me of the old timey pictures of someone with a toothache
look like she s going to rivet some p crossmembers while the menfolk are off fighting the nazis
those are the eyes of a cat who s about to jump you those dilated pupils mean business i speak from experience
i feel oddly offended at how fucking cute this damn kitty is ffs man wtf
for whatever reason it made me think of the movie mama mia
this creature is the visual representation of kindness
no matter how hard i try i just can t see how the cat wouldn t hate that can anyone offer sources on cats actually enjoying being dressed up like that bc frankly i don t believe it s ever more than bearing it and i don t think that s enough
poor cat i can tell she hates it her eyes arw seriously dilated
‚Äúladies don‚Äôt start fights but they can finish them ‚Äù
i wish kittens could stay kittens forever my cat was so cute i miss those days
this bow is not pretty it s messy the kitty is cute though
my one cat did that he didn‚Äôt get to properly feed off his mom so he always would suck my fingers or try to suck my nipple if i didn‚Äôt have a shirt on
waiting for the one redditor that flips his shit over this and accuses people of being bad pet owners even though they‚Äôve never been an expert in anything in their life
my cat also does this üòò i believe it is due to him being separated from his momma far too early but i love him all the same kitty is a cutie üòò
what are you up to op the usual watching some netflix while my cat sucks me wtfbro
bottle fed strays often do this armpits and beards seem to be the choice of most stray kittens that we ve had
that is so very precious and easier than your neck mine is bonkers
when my dog is stressed he ll use my finger as a pacifier like when he was a puppy he s will be in october
ewwweee your finger smells like kitty mouth cats have stinky butt breathe
my one cat does this not sure why i don‚Äôt think she was separated too early her brother doesn‚Äôt do it she‚Äôs and has done it since we got her when she was a kitten i‚Äôve always thought it was a security thing like a security blanket
had a cat who would nurse on our earlobes it was the sweetest thing
my cat started doing this a while back but only when angry or playing she will kinda gnaw suck on the finger and makes really weird noises it s either that or biting my hand so i guess it s alright
congratulations you are now a cat servant do as you‚Äôre told and everything will be fine
put up some signs and take it to a vet to check for a chip or if anyone reported a missing kitten then enjoy your newly acquired position as kitten servants
theres no way that cute kitten is a stray anyway thanks for taking him back to his owner
so y‚Äôall just found a cat outside and say damn guess it belongs to me now way to cute btw
hopefully it‚Äôs a proper stray and some wiener somewhere isn‚Äôt having a panic attack
this is exactly what i want to find outside my house asap so cute
who abandons such a pretty cat and why does it never happen where i live so i could pick one up
omg congrats beautiful little kitten he fell right into you how could you say no got a name yet

that‚Äôs the cutest smile ever by any chance have you tried letting your kid ride on your dog i mean only if it‚Äôs possible
i m not a big fan of babies but goddamn that is a cute baby
be careful your baby and pig will turn into sherlock and watson from watching all that british television
ok i love that dog but seriously can we talk about how fucking adorable that baby is and i don t like babies that is one damn adorable baby
speak no lawnmowers hear no lawnmowers see no lawnmowers
quick update this photo was captured a few months ago credit goes to my girlfriend thanks katherine she asked me if i can share it somewhere since they have been given to a new owner and that she misses them dearly she wanted to make the most memorable picture more memorable thanks for any and all support you guys i‚Äôm sure bae will be grateful
oh my gosh that‚Äôs adorable especially the middle one they all need a cuddle even irl as cats today
just stop for a second and consider how dumb it would sound irl if you say baby kittens instead of just kittens
from bottom to top kittty get off me kitty i m very scared please protect kitty ugh why are we hiding
that is so cute i want to hug them they are all amazingly cute but i have to say the one in the middle stole my heart
time to get a push reel mower to placate the cat it s what i did
so which one is your girlfriend how can her mum be mowing and be behind the couch and are you a cat
top here lemme in middle hai guys bottom fuck those are fat
kitty on the bottom has a look on his face that says so this is what happens when you re first not last
omg do you have more pictures of the the bottom cat my cat has an almost identical pattern
wow thank you for the info looks pretty similar to our stoats but not as pretty
i read eminem are great at first and i have to admit this guy actually is not that far away from eminem as i would have expected
i love watching cats carrying things i don t know why
cats like i must find a secluded place before i can show my soft side
i think i remember this post from awhile ago isn t this the cat that likes stealing plushies üòÇ his trot gets me every time üòª
this will remain my favorite video on the internet while i‚Äôm alive
this is exclusive footage of a blacksite interrogation
i was honestly expecting a kitten but the birb was even better
you can hypnotize a chicken like this but you hold the chicken in place
anyone else reminded of the old bugs bunny cartoon where he finds himself in the bull fighting ring and starts leading the bull around with the cape
i was expecting some little murder mittens to pop out from under that blanket
made this mistake of doing this with my cat had my finger under the sheets and move it around laughing as she attacked the motion of my finger hilarious until i needed to scratch my nose and she attacked
i love how goofy parrots are such silly beautifully awesome creatures
expected the finger to come back from the right like in japanese movies where the protagonist cleans the wooden floors with a rag to and fro
i thought the title was an order and followed the finger with my eyes
i love birds but you scraping your nails in the sheet is so bad
birds are such jerks they befriend a few people then bite everyone else
for some reason i immediately thought of a dinosaur when i saw the bird then i remembered
reminds me of the chicken hypnotization thing with the line in the sand i wonder if that works with other birds
i don t have any plans of getting a dog ever i m a cat person but i don t dislike dogs but if i was gonna get one it would be this one
what kinda tv did you get also yes handsome puppy but what is he she chewing on
he s cute but at the same time it looks like someone told him he was adopted
could we stop with this picture for a day or two maybe
the dog assistant so beautiful what breed is that husky
was thoroughly confused at why a vegetarian would have a comfort dog then my tired brain finally got with the program
if that was our husky she would be like ‚Äúyou‚Äôll be fine carl but just in the off chance it goes bad where did you bury that bone and i‚Äôm having your toys too‚Äù unplugs life support
comfort doggo if¬†you gaze¬†long enough¬†into¬†an¬†abyss the¬†abyss¬†will¬†gaze¬†back into you patient doggo ok who hired this guy
saw the capital w in way and thought i was in for an mcr joke lol
this is hilarious and so typical of our beloved cats
i was just scrolling through new and found you again that‚Äôs a beautiful cat you should get a fishing rod and bring it some food by reeling down the line to it
i dare you to get a ton of twine a small bucket some treats
now let your hair down so that prince can climb up it
are you sure it s not trapped many cats easily get stuck when there s a rectangle shape they can lay in
looks like your dog s pillow was so comfortable that the cat decided to live there for the rest of its nine lives
did you move like two appartements higher up in your building
i dunno if that s cool kitteh looks like eagle bait my wife s great aunt had her baby snatched by a golden eagle in oklahoma indian territory
the kid that lost the ball is heartbroken i hope the cat is happy tho because it all about the cat smh
that ball has been very carefully misplaced to be stuck on the edge of the roof like that
these are the kinds of quality updates i‚Äôm here for
now drop a cardboard box so the cat can build an empire
can you imagine how awesome it must ve been for that cat just wandering along the roof and hey free pillow nap time
oh man his quality of life has been improved so much
that roof looks like it was built without the aid of math
this goes to prove that everything happens for a reason
is the cat stuck on the roof can it get off and get to food and water
i wasn t sure how a bed fell on a roof but now it s clear that s the roof next your building
now drop down an umbrella to cover them from the rain
don‚Äôt know how much it rains in turkey but if it ever gets gross you should throw down a new one
totally unrelated but i never gave this much thought before how is it that rain and snow not end up in people s fireplaces when they have a chimney that is open like that
roofpillowcat could easily become a karma factory rpc needs a ball or some toys
you ve commited expecting a daily update stranger kthanks bye
pretty expected update the cat is sleeping would we anticipate anything else üòÅ once it rains that pillow is gonna get nasty
i m honestly impressed that the wind hasn t blown that pillow away yet when the cat isn t on it of course
i m struggling with the urge to fly to turkey strip and refit that roof do they not have angle grinders there
in other news generalissimo francisco franco is still dead fortheolds
i feel bad that when it rains the pillow is going to get all wet amp soggy
has it rained yet can you send down a little canopy for the little guy so he doesn t get the pillow all wet
we need a picture of the pillow with no cat on it to prove that pillow cat is alive
this is one of my favorite followed threads on the internet please tell me you have a friend with a zoom lens
things i know about cats they land on their feet they are assholes they have incredible skills at finding a comfortable spot
live stream pillow cat i won t donate but someone will
roof pillow cat is thanking the cat gods for this comfy gift from cat heaven
i feel like you could see roof pillow cat on a gphy url
i think this is just karma mining at this point lol
can you drop down catnip mice toys too please and cat treats i ll help send some
arent you sure the cat is dead you‚Äôve been updating pics and he hasn‚Äôt moved at all
do you get alot of sun incase the pillow gets wait we d be at peace knowing the cat only has to wait till the sun comes out
this is the best update thanks op i wonder if pillow cat has an owner maybe it s time for you to have a cat d
i just hope that pillow won t be washed away when it rains hard
i m wondering how much water comes down into those chimneys and pipes
good to see that the football and the rock is still accompanying the cat ‚ò∫
dog will just rip it apart if he ever gets it back too funny
i don t know what s better the fact that you found a cat who actually lays in the shit you accidentally provide for them or the non euclidean architecture everywhere
roof pillow cat roof pillow cat i just need a roof pillow cat
keep an eye on the weather forecast and retrieve the pillow before it gets wet it will get moldy

people who grow up in the city are missing out on experiences that can be had within a rural environment one of my child hood friends was a bull named elmer it would not be unusual for me to go into his pen alone when no one else was around and hang out with him he would literally follow me around like a dog the first time i ever saw him i got to feed him with the nipple bottle and give him salt licks grew up very quickly it seemed i think the op got the question backwards will society be accepted would they understand that animals of all types can become great pets

what you do in the bedroom is between you and your cow apparently
cows are national animal of my country and worshiped here
does anyone here not realise that a diet high in meat amp dairy significantly increases risk of heart disease

cows are really cute i m a city kid and i never thought they were anything more than big lumps of meat even going to a farm on a school trip did little to change it the cows were huge and smelly and just passive it s actually cute internet pictures that got me to change my attitudes and actually see them as living feeling animals
i am ok with it as long as you respect the animal rights in this relationship

ooga booga go back to the caves from which you came
my wife is obsessed with cows i ve slowly come to realize their cuteness potential
yta because this sounds like attempted coercion she likely values her family and relationship with them if you all eat together weekly it sounds like you re using this as a tool to get her to start using sexual favors to please you so you ll help maintain the familial relationship i would leave you
lets hook this bucket in this cows mouth for upvotes jackass

suffering is part of life for all creatures only in modern times have we developed the technology to avoid suffering or at least hide it to the extent that we start to think it is a thing to be avoided to cause suffering without legitimate reason is cruelty to cause suffering with proportional consideration to the achievement of a goal is life consider that we put our children in a time out as a consequence for unacceptable behavior consider that we endure rush hour traffic to get to work on time consider that we require everyone in a group to pull their weight even if it is inconvenient for them i don‚Äôt know cows if putting a bucket in his mouth somehow harms him then it‚Äôs not worth the picture but if it‚Äôs just uncomfortable for the duration of a few snaps then it‚Äôs totally worth it
isnt it ironic how he loves cows but the ropes around his head are leather
i love cows as friends to be clear they can be friendly and cute but in the end they re still going to be dinner and it s even more special
i stopped eating cows when they became my neighbors‚ù§Ô∏è
that is the cleanest cow i ve ever seen did you bath and scrub the cow before taking this pic cows in the wild are covered in dirt poo and have flies around them

this post about loving cows turned imediately into comments about fucking jesus maybe hindus are onto something side note pasipha√´ the wife of king minos loved cows too the story tells it that she had craftsmen make her a cowsuit to get freaky with the royal cattle she gives birth to the minotaur which king minos creates a labyrinth for
when you say cow lover do you mean cow lover or cow lover
there are two whole countries where you will feel at home india and switzerland
reminds me of the old joke about the difference between a good ole boy and a redneck
taken out of context that is an uncomfortable question
at the last place i worked our hr manager was obsessed with cows she had cow stuffed animals and knick knacks all over her office her office and her car were painted with cow spots oddly enough though she wasn t fond of the real thing

wow i just notices it has probably been years since i saw a butterfly in the wild
aww the butterfly and the stone in real life one of my favorite books
a bunch of mothras vs gamera the new godzilla movie is going to rock
that looks cgi af but i know nature is absolutely beautiful
i see disney is really trying to be more inclusive with their next disney princess movie
something about this just brings an overwhelming sense of happiness
you realise they are trying to drink it‚Äôs tears right
i read somewhere butterflies can only take in sodium by drinking the tears of animals
thought that floating stick was a snake in the water
i‚Äôm waiting for sir david attenborough to start narrating this scene
and here we see a pack of wild butterflies surrounding its prey before going in for the kill
seems this is where disney got their inspiration from for some of their older movies
kind of reminds me of the lord of the mountain from mushishi
this reminds me of master oogway the turtle from kung fu panda
you guys think this is cute but i ve watched enough cartoons to know those butterflies only appeared after that turtle got bonked on the head amp x b turtle head trauma is no laughing matter people
the poor turtle i hear that those things can strip a turtle of all its flesh in mere moments
they‚Äôre drinking the turtle‚Äôs tears they get certain nutrients from the tears that they otherwise wouldn‚Äôt get from their normal diet
i think that turtle is dead and they are feasting on his flesh xd
turtle tears the last actual magic left on earth amp x b butterflies eat for free amp x b cost for everyone else amp x b one soul amp x b please and thankyou
if you look closely you can tell it s fake it takes a trained eye but i have the expertise
butterflies drink turtles tears that is why they are swarming around sadness can be beautiful
they re probably drinking it s snot and tears turtle don t mind tho he s just chillin
the butterflies do this with crocodiles too they‚Äôre eating the salt and water from their tears
i didn t know why you had to pretend this is your image it s been in the internet for over a year at the very least just say look at this dog on a boat

would hate to tell him he missed auditions for the sonic the hedgehog movie
owl reminds me of cosmo kramer and his over the top entrances on seinfeld
so absolutely cute managed to stay still for a picture too even with all that corgi goofiness and the crazy pom in this lil pup
why would this little puper need saving who did this to him
i feel like corgs are seldom seen in rescue shelters either way that‚Äôs a cute puppe
if there was just a tiny bit more of pomeranian genes inside their house would be completely filled with fur trust me i have first hand experience
omg look at lil paws and his lil mouth i have never seen anything this cute
oh my god this is literally the cutest lil dog i ve ever seen in my entire life d
i love how corgi mixes just look like they re a corgi just wearing a costume of whatever they re mixed with amp x b this corgi wearing a pom costume is adorable
lol you mean my cousin i posted this a couple years ago smh
u better hide that dog or u won t be seeing it anymore
why can‚Äôt i be the one to rescue a pupper off the street
jesus christ you didn t even bother to change the name so you re directly lying for fake internet points
awwwee sweet little bean and yay for rescuing my puppy is a rescue too its so rewarding
wow that is shocking very cute but so different from mom
they look so amazingly adorable i wish i could adopt one
aside from this not being op s picture why would someone foster an unfixed dog if their own dog isn t fixed
i guess you could say i have a thing for paws but i am not in to kittyporn
i never knew something like this would bring me such joy
my desire to hold them floofs is strengthening by the second üòÇüòçüêæ
we have different definitions of little that s bigfoot territory
kinda unfair to not show his pads the lil toe beans too
if there s one thing i wish it s that my cat would let me hold her fluffy little paws
perfect little feet just perfect god s creation always perfect now someone please post their newborn baby s feet please
kind of reminds me of white winter boots with faux fur
they have such neat feet well mine has fluffy bits between his pads which makes it hysterical to watch him slip on the wood floors but i love them
i suspect he knows you have a lovely bar of something that he could eat
how cold is your office that guy is wearing a winter coat
aaaahhh the keyboard of champions the mark of a gentleman and a scholar
you sure he‚Äôs not staring at that peanut butter nature valley bar aka the best nature valley bar
i‚Äôve seen things while you fell asleep bob i‚Äôve seen it all my judgement is upon you
he doesn t pet me during work greg it s time for a change of pace
‚Äúdidn‚Äôt you feel that connection we had was it only me who felt it ‚Äù
you work at athena if so i‚Äôm coming to pet that dog
why dont you stop posting dogs and just kill them all dogs should die
why do people repost stuff on reddit like seriously why
dog is like you were in the parking lot earlier that‚Äôs how i know you
i went to a cat cafe and they all ignored me i m a dog person simply because i cant handle the aloof rejection of cats
cute little fur being stuck was for sure worth it in our city is a cat cafe as well with main coon cats unfortunately someone let the door open and the cat got out they hung up a lot of papers but it never came back so sad
my local humane society has a cattery and for awhile i was employed at the computer repair shop that serviced the humane society i always loved going on service calls there because the first minutes were me fixing some trivial issue then the next minutes were me entering said cattery and letting the cats swarm me looking for attention and likely treats it was the most glorious thing ever
internal screaming x i know this is top comment but this is love
that s their plan now you have no choice but to order more drinks
baby donkey doot doot doot doot mommy donkey doot doot doot

in case you don‚Äôt get any tonight here‚Äôs a little ass
thank you i used to have a donkey foal pic on my wall along with the landscapes and birds and buffy actresses all lost to the bedbugs
this sub is almost as limited in its range of animals as it is in its choice of topic titles
i had this picture saved on my iphone from reddit this old like proper old
i have been traveling in morocco amazing country for past week and my main take away was donkeys are the cutest trash collectors
ops first post is a repost welcome to the karma farm karma farmer
donkeys are underrated i ve always found them cute they re so innocent
gosh that s the most cutest ass i have ever seen in my entire life
dude your number and address are now on reddit thanks to your dog tag
theres a dog safe wood chew out there its called gorilla wood and is teak wood roots iirc it crumbles instead of splinters my one dog loves chewing all things wood especially as it was from outside i just move the gorilla wood in and out she loves it
sounds like my pupper picky and we eventually found a couple of kong toys he loves the grinch and teddy bear but he refused all bark box toys and treats hopefully he doesn‚Äôt start to chew on rocks like mine he‚Äôs adorable
sticks leaves rocks and dirt are just nature s toys my dog is just as likely to play with a blowing leaf as store bought toy
wow exactly like my toddler she is playing with all the sticks leaves rocks and also grass basically anything but her actual toys
thx my family and i have been looking for a dog it would be our first one and we were wondering which type of dog is a good one for first time owners
they kinda look like mini earths adorable nonetheless
they re not blind they can see the universe maybe not their paws but they can see every single star
they look like opals she can see all the possible futures all of them
he is so adorable my little kitten is getting blind as well it‚Äôs still hard on me so i really appreciate sharing this photo
should this cat be up watching the gates of valhalla
it looks like it has seen the cosmos and knows the meaning of life
this is a repost i have seen the original post but i can t link it sadly
it looks like one of two things she s seeing into the future or she has two galaxies in her eyes
this is how you become a cat lady even if you are male
if you stare into the eyes long enough you might finish my sentence
when the kitty is so cute that you experience critical existence failure and become a pile of your component atoms
aaawww too bad it just uses her cuteness to make you it‚Äôs slave and doesn‚Äôt care about your well being at all
this is how reddit convince me i need it a cat cat owns me now
thats so cute wait why is there pink stuff on my seat oh shoot my heart melted
he s gonna get you and that thing and that other thing hey look a plant
just like that golden puppy video only it s a kitten
give him a year and he ll be able to stare at a wall for hours unflinchingly
it‚Äôs like that one gif with the puppy and how short his attention span is
thats him battling the odds of not passing that exam you guys just dont see it or maybe todays long hours of accounting exam preparation did kill a few brain cells
i just think it has shit to do and can t be bothered
attention span this murder floof just killed enemy in seconds
why is it so cute i want a kitty now it s so fluffy
tail pen leaves it doesn t get much better than that unless it s a sibling to chew on
i love that little doofs ears and everything else about him
oh my this is the perfect kitten equivalent of the golden pupper that has been endlessly reposted
scratches own ear ‚Äúyo what the hell is attacking me ‚Äù
this is crazy similar to the attention span of a puppy webm
"plant plant plant plant
pen pen pen paper paper
paw paw paw paw paw void"
american curls are my second favorite cat breed right after scottish folds
that plant is heading right for us oph we re safe once again thanks to me omg that pen is heading right for us no need to thank me citizen holy samsonite my foot is heading right for us the city is safe one against thanks to there is trouble over there
when he slides on the floor for a dramatic effect then looks up at you to see if he did a good job my heart exploded
dog ‚Äú am i done yet hooman now how about now have i done the good ‚Äù
"looks at the director to get an approval d
what a beauty"
my year old sister says ‚Äúyou should tell him ‚Äòreal cute‚Äô from all of of us‚Äù
what if the dog actually died and the op lied about it playing dead
i like how he she looks up at the owner and is just like ‚Äùdid i do a good ‚Äù
omfg i love him i have several dachshunds and in a few years when my daughter is old enough i want to get her a corgi or a sloth
good on you man i too am a mature student keep thinking ahead and keep your head down you can and will do this
you are the favourite grandchild or the only grandchild
as someone with no living grandparents i am jealous treasure the time you get
this is extra cool what a great grandma and kudos for going back to college
and he knocks you down and leaves you to die damn is he like john wick
we were doing inventory at my old gig shifting and moving pallets of lights speakers and cables the owner brought his dog to hang out after a series of near misses the dog finally managed to get itself run over year old dog with a broken paw was a pretty horrible sight to see the owner even tried to fire the employee who hit the dog who was crying because they were so devastated about what happened she had to fight the termination at tribunal anyway all the best with that dog
it looks like a movie poster for a dog that investigates a murder
anyone up for creating a gofundme page for getting the old man a wagon and a bed to put in it
why are there people lying around in your warehouse
and by the look of it knock them over like a good boy should
how is it that there has never been a sports team named the labradors
so here they are the lab bros black lab the leader threaten the group he‚Äôll destroy every shoe in the house yellow lab the jolly one always up to belly scratches loves to be called good boi brown lab the smart one there is nowhere in the house you can hide dog treats without him finding them which one you pick
omg the black one faded with age and the brown one darkened with age you can t explain that
could have just flipped one of the images so that they‚Äôre in order and looking the same way
of the kinds of labs just missing mine who is of the meth lab variety still love him though
yellow labs are such dorks i have of them that face can get away with anything thanks for sharing
the one in the middle is was tired of the camera before no he has a look like where s my treat motherfucka
they are not in the same order in both photos this triggers my ocd
it is apparent that the doggo in the middle is the happiest
two shit quality pictures of two different sets of dogs
it s like the jonas brothers before and after getting back together
i love how much personality they each appear to have
i live in labrador canada and got confused for a second
these doggos are photogenic af look at those smiles
the golden looks like the goofball of the group i love it
i love how the white puppy has his arm over another ones back
these are literally both top results when you google labradors
brown and black playing jokes on the middle class white this is too political for me
the white one in second pic is like ‚Äúwhat the fuck did you just say ‚Äù
i may be mistaken but i m pretty sure the photo of the adult labs on the bottom is a very old and well known photo iirc we had the same image on our family mouse pad when i was growing up roughly years ago
you forgot to mention that in the top one they got the same haircut to trick their trainer into not being able to tell them apart
why did the brown one turn black and the black one turn brown
this reminds me of this little book series i had as a child that came with three stuffed labs all these colors
it should be left justin black lab middle travis chocolate lab right griffin yellow lab
the white puppy has his paw on top of the brown one cries in silence
read that s as labrador brothels interesting concept
milk chocolate doggo white chocolate doggo dark chocolate doggo
it s really cool how the brown one turned black and the black one turned brown as they grew older
i don t know if they are the same dogs but these might be the that work at the place i get my oil changed
he s putting his little puppy arm on his little puppy brother s back
why didn t they just pick up the puppies and place them in the same order
i love the yellow lab in the center he s so happy to get his picture taken
r mildlyinfuriating the dogs are the wrong way round in the other picture
that brown lab is up to no good the black one is thinking damn it he did it again the white one doesn t understand
cant believe my dog is gonna turn into that my labrador is weeks old btw
this just gave me a flashback to stuffed animals i had as a kid one large black lab a medium yellow lab and little lab puppies black brown yellow so it was a little family i wish i could remember what i named them
are they when they grow up seems to have stood in the wrong position they grew up together and will grow old together i only need one life like that
wtf black panther come and collect your cat it s murdering again
evacuate the city engage all defenses and get this cat a pet
that s the cutest and scariest picture of a kitten i ve seen
why are you tormenting this poor baby he‚Äôs terrified
i m so confused is that a cat wolverine as a furry or black panther
he knows he can still land on his feet with lives to spare
please coÕème back inside kitty and never go out there again üò¨
my mind be like no no pls no and my heart beat a bit fatter second by second to the video
that cat will still land on its feet gracefully cats defy the laws of physic
my heart almost stopped just from watching the video
i ve seen my cats fall off of too many simple things this video scares the daylights out of me
cats have a fairly low terminal velocity the fluffier the lower and are very capable of absorbing fall damage but they have to be oriented correctly to absorb it cats have worse injuries when they fall from a relativly low height stories iirc because they fall in a bad orientation
at first i thought the picture on the left was another dog so glad it is the same now happy one
not your dog nice work cropping out the original caption to make it your title though
this has been reposted so many times are you even trying
i think the more i see this picture the plushy is gonna come to life
these hyper realistic felt cats are getting out of hand
wow just wow i need an ambulance my heart has melted
that facial express though that little one was me who was reluctant to take that picture with my mother at the local walmart photo area
the second kittie was like a sucker punch to my heart it was too much cute in one picture
this looks like ctrl c ctrl v and then the copy was made smaller
it took me a while to realize it was a plush oh god
the other cat was like mooom i don t want to take a picture and the other cat was like no jeremy you ll take this picture or no ice cream
mom cat looks like she will take some teefies to any encroaching hand
the little one totally looks like huckle from the richard scary books i read to my yo
these cats have better eyeliner game than i do and i have opposable thumbs
i‚Äôm too distracted by the beautiful ring to look at the pup
‚Äúfearless exploration of the frozen northlands is rly tiring brb üò¥‚Äù
i mean look at her she‚Äôs freaking wasted what did you expect
the fact that this cant possibly be scripted makes me love it more
now he is thinking to himself iguana have to eat off the floor
what a cultured gentlemen have his elbows raised off the table and everything
this makes me so sad lizards don t like falling any more than humans would in a similar situation perhaps less why do people think it s so funny or cute to see a distressed animal
all i can hear is cleveland in his bathtub ‚Äú nonono nonononooooo ‚Äù
feel so bad it was an accident tell her she s loved and everything is fine she s beautiful btw
i love iguanas there probably my favorite animal i would love to have one but i don t think i ll be able to give it the best care as much as i would love to i was also told that i shouldn t get an iguana even if i could care for it because there so easily stressed that unlike a lot of other reptiles they do better in the wild
jerry lewis would be a more apt name goddamnit this is funny
this is becoming the norm due to cheetahs being high strung the dog acts like a service animal innately
then you find out the last photo was taken before the cheetah finally ate the dog the circle of life
cheetahs are said to be more doglike than other cats Ôªø
this is the problem with man s best friend should be friend of all
dogs‚Äô ability to bond so well with other species is bad ass
what are the blue socks the cheetah has on in the cage declawing
this was adorable until the declaw casts photo i m stressed now
i used to work at a zoo food and beverage and found that they do this because cheetahs have bad anxiety social anxiety and they do this to help the cheetahs be more social and it helps them not be stressed out if they get moved around from different zoos or enclosures
great thing to do good bless you for taking the time to help another living creature
i m curious i ve seen quite a few videos showing animal rescue in india saving doggos trapped in tar why does this happen so frequently
do they use dish soap to get them clean from tar like they do from oil
that little kiss the woman gave the pup melted my heart
how do people get away with this shit the son of a bitch that did this deserves a year sentence thank god there are people that care nice job guys thank you for caring
how long was it before they ended up back in the tar
animal aid do great things and save so many animals check them out on yt
hello üáÆüá≥ thank you for your kind heart so glad you saved the pups good will come your way someday cute little fellows
my god these pups look like my doggo and i m crying so hard huge thank you to those amazing people that cared enough to save those precious babies
videos of dogs getting saved from things always make me cry
how is this not violating rule number one this is not what i come to this sub to see
clearly one of those puppies knows whose idea it was and is giving them an earful
they must have used gasoline to get that tar off like that
pups have their lives saved immediately fight each other
can you believe there are people out there who don t like dogs
i love that he can tell when it s his turn and gets himself ready üòçüò≠
i wish i could have more of these videos i‚Äôve never seen another dog this awesome at soccer lol
i like how the dude in the shorter shorts softened his kick so the dog would get less impact
with my current motor skills the best i could be is the guy holding the camera
that mini scorpion kick to keep the ball in play still was nice
is that the southern california coast looks like santa barbara or the bu
when you said ‚Äúlike a professional player‚Äù i expected the ball to barely touch him and he rolls around on the ground clutching his leg
the dog is like i‚Äôm not going to be known as the dropper
is that an australian accent right at the end of the video
"i assumed the dog was going to start crying and fake being hurt
kinda disapoinged"
i ll take things a dog can do better than me for alex
i m worried about his quality of life later on cte is real
great video the smudge on the bottom right corner was distracting though
gt he plays like a professional player that s funny i didn t see him throw himself on the ground rolling and crying about being hurt
i was wondering who s out of those three would screw that up
legitimately if they were kicking the ball to me instead of the dog they would have lost far sooner
not sure why but i appreciate being able to see the volley until they lost something about that closure is really satisfying
i m kinda hoping that these were in their own playing and this random ass dog decides to join in perfectly haha
it brings me such joy that this dog is so excited and smart
why is this kitten looking to adopt looks way to young to have a kid
wait if both your hands are occupied how did you take the pic
oh dear what happend to your right hand s thumb nail üò•üôå
fairy godmother and cinderella now you can go dancing to the ball
thats awesome and so damn cute she was very impressed
she looks like she s been practicing for that moment
dangerous to repeater the need for little girls to be princesses we need to promote women and girls saving themselves
where was this when i was little i love sleeping beauty she is my favorite
imagine having a gown like this for your wedding walking down the aisle in what is a nice and simple dress then turning it into an amazing gown when you reach the end of the aisle except you would have probably spent all the money on the dress and just get married at the courthouse still those city employees would be gooped
i thought it was cool and wanted to buy one for my daughter so i looked it up for the cheapest one for a mid priced ones and they go to like k now i realize i will only be buying dress for her and it will be a prom dress and that s it
where can you get these dresses in adult sizes asking for a friend
she was definitely prepared to pretend to be impressed and then was legitimately impressed cute gif
anyone know where i can get one of these except instead of a dress i want to turn into batman or iron man
i love how the disney princess goes from faking being imoressed to just actually being inpressed by it
i love the cast members at disney they are amazingly genuine
i‚Äôm love this more than the first three times i see it maybe i‚Äôll repost it next
after seeing this reported enough i only just now realized the interlacing in this gif lol
i love these actors that work at disney honestly they‚Äôre so nice and human it just warms me
what a sweet little aryan girl it is her future that we fight for not our own
not just a princess i m a grown man i m impressed with the kid s skills too is it hard to do these changes
i like how you can see the disney princess‚Äôs reaction exponentially increase from content to mental freak out
seen a few times before but never realized how big her little girl heels are on her it s so adorable that she wanted to compete the full outfit regardless of comfort lol adorable kid
that s not a real disney princess it s just a woman in a costume
how to impress a disney princess more like how to impress anyone that was seriously awesome
if disney is not selling costumes in the park that do this they re missing out on massive upside
but when i did that i was escorted out of disney and told never to come back
props for pulling off that twirl in those shoes they look sizes too big
literally better reveal than some ru paul drag queens
i think this is the little girls who‚Äôs dad makes her the dresses
pocahontas at disney world was the hottest chick ive ever seen super model worthy if i were more well prepared i would have dressed up like john smith and hung out with her all day
she went from the acting excited to genuine amazement
the performers at disney parks are legends they go all out with enthusiasm for the kids even in scorching weather and they never fail to go with the flow and play along
this is my friend‚Äôs daughter and she actually is a talented seamstress and sewed it herself not a designer daddy dress just for those curious
anyone know where i can buy this for my year old daughter and win daddy of the year
dang even team ricket would be impressed by that quick change
to be fair rapunzel had fun stepping on grass and watching ufos she s impressed with anything
is there a full speed version somewhere the magic about these dresses is that you barely see the change during the spin so putting it in slow motion kills the actual effect
so you re telling me if i wear a dress to disney world i can pick up a princess and not get arrested
now that fox is with disney is that the princess who works at at coffee shop
there are websites showing similar reveals there s apparently a lot of technical logistics involved some of the reveals i ve seen are even more impressive than this one involving even more layers and hair being let down etc but this is still good
i‚Äôve been binge watching these videos on youtube lately so cute
baby you are a princess ü•∞you are fabulous sweetheartü§©
this dress makes me wish i had a daughter so i could buy one for her
have never cared much about fashion in my life but this little girl is cool as fuck
i love her reaction i hope both their days were made
oh okay i thought she was going to turn into lynda carter s wonder woman lol
for some reason i thought the little girl was gearing up for a spinning roundhouse
now if she can spin the other way to lock it back up even walt would be proud
reminds me of this fb story from one of my friends who interned at disney gt being in housekeeping i rarely get a lot of guest interaction but today just made up for that and then some i was having a rough day today my rooms were all super bad and i finished super late i was tired and frustrated because i had to wait for the later bus because i finished late so while i m at the bus stop this adorable young mom and dad sat next to me with their young child i wasn t really paying much attention when the father said excuse me miss do you know if the magic kingdom bus comes through here and it s then i looked up and saw the most beautiful probably or year old girl i had ever seen decked out in a gold princess belle dress she was bald and wore a celebration pin that read i m celebrating beating leukemia she clung to her dad s arm and looked at me with big eyes and an even bigger smile i couldn t help but play with them a little i said why of course thank goodness we ve found you princess they ve been waiting for you all day at the kingdom i asked if i could have her autograph and she climbed up on the seat next to me and we chatted about all things magical and silly for about minutes before her carriage took her to her castle before her mom got on she turned to me and said thank you and god bless you i m years old and i will never get over how magical this place is i m so glad izzy got a chance to see it
if only new disney movies were as good as the parks
nope i can admire the dedication while still disagreeing
no need enjoy it i think it got unlocked by admins console controls
a gun should fix it that s what i did when my cat went dog mode
there s a switch on the belly you have to scratch it to activate good luck
this is me when i play video games all night then hop in bed with my wife
please tell me someone is watching that live at all times
wtf is wrong with you letting a huge nasty dog sleep with your kids man people are dumb asses so un safe
willing to bet that years from now that little girl still sleeps with a big dog on her bed maybe two
lol why the hell did i get downvoted i m joking people good god
do you want a best friend forever because that s how you get a best friend forever
and doesn‚Äôt wake up in the morning due to being dismembered by a fucking pitbull shit dog for shit people
that child should not be alone with a dog regardless of the breed
read this as little girl fucks pitbull before bed i hate my brain
bull breads are nanny dogs my friend had a pit i don t think this is a pit though and when he had his son considered giving her a new home his dad convinced him not to do that turns out that dog knew right away the baby was part of the family and would always look out for him one time he smashed his fingers in a door and the dog went crazy barking and ran to find one of the parents when there were thunder storms the dog would not leave the boys side i loved that dog rip lucy
i wonder which parent laughed so hard they peed themselves
coming from someone who owns two pitbulls she is not tucking him in she is wrestling that blanket to cover herself mostly tucking in the pitbull was priority number my two pitties sleep in my bed with me and take up the entire freaking bed so wrestling them for blankets is an everyday occurance
if i even move on my bed for long than seconds my dog will let out a sigh and get off the bed and go into the other room that dog is patient as fuck
it never ceases to amaze me how much people trust their pets with their little precious children i don t care how big the dog is how much you love them or what breed they are you don t leave children and pets unattended this is how children get hurt and never in the history of dog bites have i ever seen an owner not say ohmygosh they were the sweetest dog ever we never saw it coming
not quite as cute but when my cat came home from her vaccinations she was drowsy and uncomfortable so when it came time for me to go to sleep she was still sleeping in my spot on the bed i slept in the living room on the couch so she could get her rest i love my animals so much
if you raise them right they re no monsters the dog too
i wonder if she ever gets the feeling she‚Äôs being watched
that dog right there would give it s life for that little girl
downvote me but isn t it a really bad idea to leave dogs alone with infants
they used to call pit bulls nanny dogs because they re so good with children
oh look one of these creepy insecure cameras anyone on the internet can probably log into cheap cameras should not be in your child s bedroom if you font understand how the tech works don t buy it
when they make sure to get the ears someone is raising this kid right
what horrible parents allow pit bulls around their kids
something tells me the op put pitbull in the title to get that controversial karma
someone doesn t have to deal with monsters under the bed
or she tried to suffocate it after the video stopped
that was so cute and i don‚Äôt even like kids that dog is like twice the size of that little girl
this would put an end to child abductions next baby shower gift for sure
absolutely terrifying no way that toddler‚Äôs mattress has the lumber support for a full grown pitty proper sleeping habits are their own reward ladies and gentlemen
it‚Äôs things like this that reminds me why these dogs were once called america‚Äôs dog
the way she gets up our of her cumfy mode to do the whole deal like they say if you do it do it right
there s one kid who will never worry about monsters in her room at night
how sweet of that dog to let that little girl sleep in his bed
only question is why they got camerad in her room i understand baby security and stuff but she will cry if anything happens so why tho
every time i see something like this i cringe so hard suuuuuuch a bad idea
he s so cute with his head on the pillow next to her dogs are the best
i don t mean to be that guy complaining about small children around animals amp x b but i am gonna say that i don t really think a child that small should be near any large dog alone maybe not even a small one when they re sleeping i mean kids can literally die just from sleeping so introducing a large animal into the equation seems risky to me
am i the only one hoping that s a drum kit in that childs bedroom
soft doggie warm doggie big ass ball of fur happy doggie sleepy doggie bark bark bark
jeezus h i misread the word ‚Äútuck‚Äù and the well yeah fasting does a number on the brain
what a lovely girl her parents should be so proud of her and themselves ‚ù§Ôªø
last time this was posted people kept complaining about how bad the parents are for having a pitbull leaving a toddler alone with a dog the dog can suddenly lay down on the baby and smother it to death as though the baby would just lay there and accept its death it s not an infant it s just a toddler one mobile at that
just fucking say dog don t say the whole fucking breed to sound cool or for a subliminal message
if this isn t the most adorable thing you ve ever seen
look at that evil aggressive crazy and dangerous dog s
after this kind of love this is now the safest baby anywhere
that s cute but she shouldn t be sleeping with that thing pitbulls attack children on a daily basis
psa objectively that s a catastrophe waiting to happen kind of like leaving a toddler with loaded gun vs a water gun i know i know raise em right i know i know you met a nice pit so have i i know i know it s the owner not the breed an unsupervised child can still poke or prod any dog whether it be a teacup maltese or a pit bull and both dogs can still react in defense regardless of how that dog was brought up or raised what dog wouldn t react defensively to being poked in the eye though one of them is like x likelier guess which at any rate only one of those scenarios is capable of being catastrophic due to physics and mechanics alone muscle mass mass in general sharp teeth strong jaws temperament being equal one of those things is not like the other also don t assume that attacks exclusively happen in defense sometimes they are unprovoked amp x b source am an industry insider who directly comes into contact with these cases on a daily basis tons of cases where pits ripped kids faces or limbs off if not killed them and they are times not exaggerating pits i would highly recommend and advise leaving a young child alone w such a powerful dog and with any dog in general looking upon this as cute only serves as to promote the culture that makes this sort of behavior possible which when attacks do occur doesn t exactly help your case in defending pits it s just better all around to not let babies or young children be in an enclosed space together cause once that action starts there s little you can do to stop it we re talking mere seconds if not milliseconds amp x b still disagree fine if you re right then i m just embarrassed if i m right well do i need to say more
i don t ever want a kid children are so violent and unpredictable this one seems cool though i d probably keep her jokes
let‚Äôs see the vid where she freaks the pit bull out and it rips the little child to shreds
a dog any breed has no business in the cot of a kid that age
pitbulls are amazing creatures always remember there‚Äôs no such thing as a bad dog only bad owners these owners are obviously amazing
now the pitbull s feet are going to be cold for the rest of the night job
a dog breed that literally bred and selected for violence over hundreds of years hey let s keep it next to our toddler
this is me now with my dogs and i m weeks pregnant so i can see my little girl doing the same i love snuggling with my babies
mfw i ring the doorbell and the pitbull freaks out and mauls the toddler
oh sure because that s a safe thing to do don t suppose you ve also got a pet coyote in there somewhere too
i feel bad for her her parents are garbage degenerates
so adorable what is it about pit bulls and babies man they always seem to have a connection
i love how the the blanket was kinda fine at first but she keeps pulling it more and more over his face haha so cute
ever heard the saying let sleeping dogs lay i had a lab slept with me every once in a while dog was dreaming and woke me up i sat up and it bit me in the face out of reaction the dog immediately felt bad visible by body language but it was a reaction not a choice by the dog having a pitbull in bed with your infant is ignorant and incredibly dumb people say its not the breed its the owner very clear here but its both
that child is going to strangle herself with all those sheets
cute my friend saw this and was like o h i thought it was something else
doesn t matter what breed the dog is this is one of the stupidest things you can do as a parent and dog owner never leave your kid alone with any dog unsupervised
dog is laying there with his eyes open thinking when will this end
wow i can‚Äôt believe that they put them in so much danger everyone knows that babies are vicious that poor pitbull
i was really apprehensive when i clicked on this because i was expecting the rapper
i love pitbulls idk why people think they are so aggressive it s the owners that are training them wrong
and look at those wonderful natural big floppy ears
looks annoyed nermal s flight to abudabi got cancelled again
i can think of garfield without remembering eldritch garfield

that s not cute that s an overweight cat which impacts its life expectency by multiple years
fat cartoon cats are funny real life fat cats are sad and will die sooner
linda that lasagna better have meat in it this time or i swear to
we have a similar large orange kitty named aslan or ass as we tend to call him eats everything not guarded
i thought this cats name was lasagna for two seconds it‚Äôs been a long day
how he did that at the end his name human cat binkey barnes this cat is cursed by ancient power you must sacrifice they or it will cause genocide
omg give that cat some more treats he‚Äôs in pure blissful heaven from them and i love it look at those little licks and that face
my cats lose their damn minds for friskie‚Äôs treats your treats look like those but they might not be that said my cats truly sell their souls for those treats
i don t know horse rearing at all but it just seems like the baby horse is all like i can run now run with me run with me
‚Äúcan‚Äôt let mom see this but i can‚Äôt control myself‚Äù
this makes my heart burst my first horse ever called jiffy was a spunky palomino and he was my best friend i had him for at least years he just crossed the rainbow bridge not to long ago thank you for posting this it brought back some age old memories
i love the idea of catching the zoomies like you sneeze or something and all of the sudden you ve run around the house times and you re not sure how you got in the other room
does everyone else call their pet running for no reason the zoomies too
mom mom mom mom momma mamma omg look what i can do mom mom momma momma look what i can ungfdffsshhddsaasfff sorry i bumped into you mom mom look what i can do mom momma mamma
horses are so muscular i don t think i have ever seen a obese horse
i dunno i think the baby crashes into her on purpose for attention lol
beautiful color is there a majestic name for it or is just plain ol tan or nudeü§îüôÇ
please tell me you don‚Äôt leave that halter on in the pasture
look at this a fecking one month old can run while what do humans do at one month old fecking sleep
month and it s scurrying around like that human babies can t even walk when they re months old we re a bit rubbish
horses doing this is the most entertaining and heart warming thing ever when i had a horse he would always do this when we moved him to the bigger field and bigger barn even when he was older it was so cute
come on ma play with me oh well guess i‚Äôll just eat in stead
no need for the down vote folks i noticed my punctuation fail as to answer your question there can only and will only be one
if the idiot holding the phone knew people s eyes weren t vertically placed perhaps we d see more of the surrounding area and the horse itself instead of the sky and ground
awe look at her learning fine motor control just like a human toddler trying to work a fork
the zoomies how cute i say my cat is parkouring when she does this and jumps off the furniture in our house
looks to me like the horse is freaked by the dangling rope off its face i would be too that s one scared fowling
my dog scratches the living hell out of me when i try to put her in the bath she d probably be cleaner if i just kept her inside all day but she s basically a mini panther and needs to be outside hunting it s at the point now where i just leave a window open for her so i don t have to put up with her meowing at the door all the time
he‚Äôs bertiebertthepom on instagram a super cute boi
literally me everyday after getting out of the shower
looks like my dog when he has been outside in the burrs
i think you re mistaken that s a spikey bear for sure
i know he‚Äôs a brownish area with points and i love him
this would make a nice water color sketch where them people at that do that
finding this subreddit is the best thing to happen to me in months it makes me happier with each picture i see
if bakugou had brown hair and was turned into a doggo
looks like it will be mince meat soon if it doesn‚Äôt get off the road
your just gonna repost a top pic from yesterday with no credit to the photographer or op
looks a bit like wile e coyote after a dynamite blows up in his face
fox looks angry he is not happy at your lack of giving noms and treats to him
i don t know if majestic is the word i would have used but very cool looking
its eyes are very vibrant and beautiful against its black fur ‚ù§
any way i look at this majestic animal i do not want to see it when i take out my garbage at midnight in my shorts and no shirt
it also looks like its judging me for decisions i made in college it knows
is it crossbreed with a wolf it has a long nose and ears
that is obviously a kitsune will it bring good fortune mischief or perhaps transform into a beautiful woman to beguile and temp you
he looks like he crawled up from hell so he can get some cuddles since no one down there wanted to give him any
looks like a fox with fire powers born in the darkness
looks dark just like your soul for reposting this without credit
secretly an arsonist and watching a house fire behind the camera
i don‚Äôt think majestic means what you think it means
live action rendition of the new shadow flame type eevee evolution
pretty sure this is just a red fox with a lot of melanistic influence
looks like he ate a stick of dynamite in an old loony toons episode
heimdall has been reincarnated into a cute organism
what a cutie i d never get anything done i d be spending all of my time cuddling
why s he so sad i wants to cuddle away the sadness ‚ò∫Ô∏è
poor little thing is so sleepy can t keep his eyes open
please tell me his name is something halloween themed
i want him to have a super power other than cuteness
i would like you to respect my personnel space lord vader thx palp
i wish my black eyes were as cute i just look soulless and dead
that‚Äôs a beautiful dog you have and yes she is truly very very cute as well
she s gorgeous and her eyes make her look like the sweetest little floof
her eyes reflect the endless possibilities of the universe she has no need for sight when she already saw its majesties in its full splendor she has seen the beginning and the end and yet she remains happy she has given us a grate gift this day for our future is a bright one
i personally think animals are cuter alive than than they are stuffed but you do you also happy cake day
you probably never lost a pet yet because why would you say smth like that
was gonna say that‚Äôs just mean to put bowl in from the pupper and not offer him one üíô
i have a dog named cupcake she doesn‚Äôt like cupcakes but she does like pancakes
my pup‚Äôs name is tater tot too i just call him tater though i just knew i had to name him something potato related
i m aorry for your loss but this shows that you have a kind and beautiful home i hope these guys have a beautiful life together
the peace on julie s face is evident i m so glad that she got a new friend to cure her loneliness
that s cute if only my mom s cats and dogs could get along like that instead the cats kick the shit out of the dogs if they step too close
i m so sorry for your loss sending lots of love from the barkbox office
i don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs part bear pretty sure you just have yourself a bear cub there
super cute i also have a long hair gsd be prepared for the furpocalypse
my first dog was named pepper i hope your dog has a long and prosperous life like mine did
i bet your vet and vet tech were in puppy heaven on this visit
oh my god that is one of the most precious puppers i have ever paid my eyes upon including my own
definitely part baby bear does she steal pick a nik baskets yet yogiforever
i knew someone who thought this was actually possible they were convinced they had met dogs who were part bear special kinda folk
she looks so much like my childhood pup is she schipperke
as someone who has seen several pictures of bears i can confirm this belief
wait how tf did would a dog be part bear its really cute but i m just saying thats one strange relationship
ah yes if we measure the floof to cute ratio i can confirm that this pup is in fact part bear
i used to have a pure bred chow chow growing up named pepper she also looked exactly like a small black bear
hate to break it to you someone sold you a bear cub as gsd
it would be nice if the floof to mass ratio remained the same as dogs grew up
just so everyone is clear on it dogs and bears cannot interbreed as they are different species and their dna is completely incompatible
am i not the only person who saw another face under the dogs face
we have one exactly the same now months he looked so bear like as a tiny pup we called him teddie he even has the same white toe
i work at petsmart and the best part of my job is giving treats to the good bois and girls that come in i love you hellena stay beautiful
shes so cute so little and her ears are already standing up it took my gsd loki s ears about months to stand up completely be warned if you re new to gsds they are very vocal not just barking but whining and moaning too
did mcr write a song about her a song about how cute she is
love the dog but your title is the real winner here
this is a shot of whiskey he is my favorite dog he‚Äôs grey and has black spots like a poison dart frog today is whiskeys half birthday so wish him a good day this boy deserves the best so please don‚Äôt delay
month old whiskey no thanks try posting again in years people will love whiskey when he is years old
nawww about a year ago we had to say goodbye to our big boi irish wolfhound cross his name was whiskey i miss him a lot this lil boi whiskey is
the only shot of whiskey i d enjoy having i had two dachshunds when i was younger marshall and charlie loved those goobers so much
upvoted for cute title and cute pup amp x b is this your first dachshund we have a little dachshund mix that we adore getting him was the best life choice
just a heads up if he ever breaks his back as doxy‚Äôs are prone to do try acupuncture first our little guy got completely paralyzed and needed back surgery but we tried acupuncture and redlight therapy and he now jump up on the couch again and instead of it costing upwards of grand is was like for sessions
oh my goodness what a perfect and sweet doggo i would want all the kisses if i saw him pass by
how is that face scary that is nothing my loveable right there ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
it doesn t help that someone elected to surgically alter his ears look like a fighting dog the cruel arrogance of humans to do this to animals they claim to care for just nuts
people tell me to be scared of pitbulls but recently i ve been watching there behavior and really looking at them and they seem to be a great dog
i still don t get how people find pits so scary they are the coolest dogs with rotties and dobermans so cool but such nice dogs if they aren t bred for attacking bestest dogs if you aren t treating them like pieces of meat
the wat hes prancing around like that hes making an ass of himself
but i thought i already gave op s mum all the attention she needed
mine broke out and went to a nearby farm today my dad went to collect him and he was so happy to be home love donkeys so much
reminds me of the time we rode donkeys down the grand canyon amp my brother handed me a cool rock to keep it was heavier than i thought and i fell off trying to hold it i was totally stoned off my ass
i once walked into a brothel with a jackass and honeycomb
i got chased by donkeys too many times üò™ they scare me
there are herds of wild donkeys in the hills near my house and they are fucking rad definitely deserving of more attention
donkeys keep animals like wolves away donkeys are very smart and very strong and can protect real good they walk away from the herd looking like an easy prey but then the kick comes
i have a special place for donkeys in my heart after seeing that saddest fucking movie ever made ‚Äúthe mouse and his child ‚Äù oh no i‚Äôm gonna cry üò≠
donkey s are smart animals show them affection and they will remember it for the rest of their lives they rarely make the same mistake twice and recognize the humans that love them back
ya just gotta love donkeys now that we‚Äôre no longer hauling bank heist money from the bolivian hills and getting involved with shoot outs with the entire bolivian army donkeys are cute
you should try trimming a donkey‚Äôs hooves let alone shoe one then tell me how much attention you want to give them
i walked past a donkey this morning and almost died when i yelled behind me
what a tiny cute ass never thought i d say that outside of an nsfw sub
donkey was not always shrek s buddy he used to be an adorable young donkey running throughthe fields of gold
they also kill coyotes and stuff to protect livestock always amazes me
my irish grandma used to have donkeys living in a field right next to her house besides the occasional extremely loud heeeeehawwwwww at am they were extremely cute and the of them would but heads to eat bread crumbs leftover from dinner and would even let us pet them they were good boys also you could tell when they were about to yell as they would exhale with their teeth displayed realllly loud like some weight lifting dude whos pissed off but knows he can t hit anyone cause he d shatter their teeth least it let us get away before our eardrums were ruptured lol
when i saw this post i had to think of gordon ramsey screaming at someone you absolute donkey
freakin adorable take my upvote before i wanna take this adorable pup üòÅüíô
those ears look like they feel exactly like little velvet purses
looks so much like mine does üòç akitas are my favorite
i ve had akita s in my life first one was saki and the second one was max saki lived until cancer took her at she s still one of the loves of my life after saki passed for my sons th birthday i got him max as his first dog max was awesome he and saki are two of my many pets in life that can still bring me to tears saki passed away in the mid s and max passed away around ish anyway akita s are fucking awesome if you have the patience to deal with their quirks and the shedding beautiful pup i want to say male because of the head but can t tell for sure
akita s are the best breeds in my life i ve had shadow who passed when i was younger and mysha who is still going strong shadow was the best dog xd despite stealing my peanut butter sandwiches when i was baby
i have a german shepherd and akita mix when he was little he looked just like this lol
i grew up with akitas have had great family dogs and absolute war machines
cute enjoy akitas are great dogs my uncle had one for years and she was the best most loyal most goodest girl
i just imagine yojimbo yelling daigoro everytime i see an akita
had akita‚Äôs much of my life they taught my oldest how to walk great family dogs love them
looks like a stuffed animal so much perfect floof lt
all dogs are good dogs but akita s are best dogs i haven t been able to get another pet after our last one passed away because it was too sad seeing a family member so close to you go away so soon loved coming home and having her say hello i still say she was trying to say hello in english to us when she howled miss ole waggle butt
o m g that is the cutest pupper i have ever seen in my whole life
i grew up with akita s they are amazing dogs i hope you enjoy your adorable pup
that looks identical to the akita i had years ago god i loved that dog they‚Äôre such good dogs
be sure to play with it s paws a lot as a puppy my family had an akita that was very aggressive when it came to his paws pretty much snapping at people
fuck i loved my akita first dog i ever had they are family for life
my tenant has an incredible looking male he named baloo i want his dog so bad but baloo is very attached to his people
you are now and forever puppers slave you have no will of your own especially with that head tilt
oh thank you for this had akitas when i was a girl and my first one keko looked like this and would tilt her head she was a real nanny dog to us i hope you have many years of fun with yours
it is the spitting image of myakita he‚Äôs gone now but seeing your pup made me smile they are the best of dogs
my family currently has akitas and we are getting another one soon best breed ever most loyal breed too my mother and i show a couple of our girls we have had litter so far with the father argo being the male akita in the us hope your baby is happy and healthy
has your puppy ever been groomed did the hair gel like that naturally
this akita is adorable i used to have an akita named cujo when i was younger wasn‚Äôt the best name lol he was great when he was still a baby but once he grew up sweet jesus he became a beast he attacked anything and everything in sight we had a german shepard named lassie while we had cujo cujo bit him one day and a few days later he passed away sadly my brother told me he had some type of disease i can‚Äôt remember what exactly it‚Äôs been years but one day cujo went berserk and broke through a fence and attacked a couple he was put down sorry to put a semi sad story i just saw the adorable little akita and my memories came up
please please please keep an eye on their hips get a ramp for car access i started mine out on one when he was four or five wish i d done it sooner do whatever you can to go easy on their hips they are so prone to hip issues whatever you can do do it early and be consistent
i have an akita wolf hybrid who is the most ridiculous dog i ve ever had lbs of pure love and fur good luck with your small bear
human look he‚Äôs tilting his head so cute doggy if i tilt my head and look cute my human will spare me
looks so much like my little boy ‚Äô he‚Äôs months get all that puppy love in now they grow so fast
the hair that dog sheds will kill your hvac blower motor replace the filter more often than normal
reddit needs more akita inu i had one from my to my pretty rare for a purebred dog she was my best friend and the sweetest girl in the world
i grew up with akita‚Äôs they have all passed on now but this one looks like my baby boy his name was choco very cute pic ü•∫
i really want an akita so stinking adorable my heart
are akitas bred for fighting someone told me that once
this is my boy joe he s weeks right here been the best pup my first akita but i think i ll be getting these the rest of my life amp x b i appreciate the suggestions from the fellow akita owners i m religiously taking him places and getting him socialized with other people children and dogs as i ve read that without socialization they have a tendency to be intolerant of others outside of their pack mainly animals amp x b he s very intelligent already knows sit down come and stay at weeks he s so tuned into people and he s an amazing companion these are really special dogs even though he s a handful
i m curious how did you teach her the counter was off limits
my childhood cat knew that she was not allowed on the dining room table but loved to play with the objects that were frequently left on the table so she would sit on a chair and just blindly reach up with her paw until she found something to knock onto the floor and play with
now do you really expect poor roxy to distinguish conceptually between being on the stool and not being on that fascinating counter where you are forever involved in the most interesting of projects oh yes and considering how much she loves you
i m happy that i m not the only one who has always trained my cats chair ok table tops big no no
pretty sure i just saw this scene in john wick parabellum
i have the same two paw rule for the my table my cat walter will lay on it with his back paws hanging very smart kitties
you can tell the cat slowly slid further and further on the counter without fully committing because it wasn‚Äôt sure if it was going to be scolded or not
we re so lucky to have cats let them do whatever they want
my cats were allowed on our island barstools but not on the island i smacked them the first time and then started snapping at them and they got the picture pretty quickly it was funny a little while later one of them was sitting on the barstool when we started to prepare food he got curious and put up his paw so it barely touched the island one little snap and he brought it back down he knew his boundary and that he crossed it then a few months after this i caught him on the kitchen table laying down like he belonged there snapped my fingers and instantly he was off my dad was like how d you do that i told him you teach the cat boundaries and he ll learn it is amazing how quickly my cats shape up at the sound of my fingers snapping now
well there is chicken to steal the things we do for snacks
that face is too cute she knows she s being a pain haha
i imagine roxy also enjoys her front row seat to that meat being served behind her
looks more like she s allowed on the counter and not the barstool
my cat would do the same thing but also we d catch her in the sink when she thought the coast was clear that rascal
‚Äúroxy on the counter‚Äù implies entirely on the counter which she is not video review shows one toe clearly on the stool so no foul also awarded bonus points for being adorable roxy wins
my cat knows all the places he‚Äôs not allowed and purposely goes to them to get me up when his dinner is late cats are smart
i remember seeing this like years ago with the same title
i can t help but laught when pet owners think they ve trained their pet to stay off furniture and work tops y all know your pets put their butts where ever they damn well please the moment you leave the room
can we discuss this perfect cat face like sorry not sorry
she‚Äôs a very smug and smart kitty that‚Äôs a face of ‚Äúi‚Äôm still on the stooool can‚Äôt tell me off ‚Äù
haha this is so much like my cat joni s personality it even kinda looks like her
hey this is my photo from a few years back glad roxy can still bring in the karma
my cat would be going crazy for that in the background
i enjoy seeing animals that are smart enough to understand the limit that has been imposed or maybe i like to imagine he actually thinks it s just his rear paws you dont want on the counter
omg my kitty does the exact same thing with our barstools and the island i know she‚Äôs gotta be hopping up on there when we aren‚Äôt around
one of our dogs is the same way except with the sliding glass door to the back yard he knows he is not allowed in so he lays partly inside and partly outside the door all the time
you can tell by the look on her face that she doesn t give a shit about your rules
roxy can do whatever the hell roxy wants to do she is beautiful
my dog would do this when i would say ‚Äúin bed‚Äù when we would be eating dinner at first he would have his entire body in and he would slowly inch out of the bed leaving only a paw behind he knew he wasn‚Äôt entirely wrong and i never had the heart to tell him he was it made me smile
roxy also knew her owner was a pushover she also just buried a turd with those front paws
so punt her into the other room she ll get the message
hey buddy b p you are a cutie pie you look like my lukie
hey there buddy you have a very nice face glad i got to meet you
he s an old soul look at his eyes he s a handsome pup enjoy him peace
get you a girl that looks at you the way that cat looks at rotisserie chicken
i hope you made sure to remove those thin leg bones they can choke on
super curious what the actual situation is is that a yawn is the cat looking at something else
i don t know why but this picture feels cursed to me
just thin a headless corpse propped up with a birthday candle in place of its head ogled at by a cat
whos fckn cat is this get this fckn cat out of this fckn chair right fckn now
i wanna boop the shoot outta the snoot so darn cute congrats
do not buy adopt there are many animals that will love you for free
"i read this as the dog‚Äôs name is ‚Äúmeat coconut‚Äù i have been in reddit for too
long today"
cute puppy but other puppies a being put down due to the fucked up industry your supporting
i want to hug the puppy coconut is adorable thank you for giving him her i wasn t sure a home
who still buys with so much information available about this congratulations you re part of the problem
hey congrats so cute i‚Äôm sorry everyone is shitting on your happiness but welcome to reddit where people feel the need to apply their opinions to a situation they knew nothing about drown them out and enjoy
coconut like when you broke a coconut to drink the milk
while i agree with adopt don‚Äôt shop i also feel bad for everyone trashing on you you just wanted to share your cute pup not being a shelter dog doesn‚Äôt make him any less cute people make bad decisions but it‚Äôs too late now what do you expect the guy to do take it back
what a cutie since you mentioned this is your first i‚Äôll share what my dad told me when i got my first pup ‚Äúall he has is what you give him‚Äù i‚Äôm not saying you need that advice but i always always try to keep that in mind and wish more people did
ugh commence the adoption bitching i don t see these people complaining about the cheap food source shelter animals are to their current pets yeah you can complain about people not adopting but i don t see yall complaining about how cheap it is to feed your adopted shelter mutt other shelter mutts that didn t get adopted if that s wrong to you then feed your animals real meat cuts for every meal maybe your empty wallet will teach you to not be self righteous and understand that life feeds on life the other lesson is to let people live their lives the way they want to downvotes are angry people who can t handle themselves after learning their beloved fido has been eating canned unloved fido that was still purchased and not adopted in the end
i think peanut would be a better fit lol cute doggo anyways
you bought this dog from craigslist great now we have another dog owner that‚Äôs going to feed it‚Äôs dog fat and ole roy
hmmm cute dog but i know what reddit does with coconuts
my mom just got a purebred chihuahua puppy from a shelter for also craigslist is full of backyard breeders which are the reason so many dogs are put down each year lastly every single person i know that got a craigslist breeder puppy has lost it to parvo so i recommend getting your dog to a vet asap to get it checked out
that dog is so cute its a beautiful name for a beautiful dog
coconut is so damn cute please please go to the vet as soon as possible to get checked for parvo and begin the vaccination regimen necessary for new puppies i used to volunteer with and foster chihuahuas for a rescue in tennessee and saw so many of these stories of buying a dog on craigslist or a puppy store only for the new owner to lose their pup too soon i do agree with the adopt don‚Äôt shop thing but hell you‚Äôve got the dog now and he‚Äôs adorable give him the home he deserves
jesus fucking christ some of you people are sitting way too high on your horses some people want a specific breed of dog and sometimes those breeds are extremely difficult to find outside of breeders after my beagle died i wanted a non shedding dog small breed dog so i signed up on multiple adoption sites and looked at all the new postings for over months until i found what appeared to be a great fit i applied and was chosen to adopt her and while i m not giving up on her what i got is barely what i wanted she was a year old yorkie mix which is great but she sheds a pretty good amount for a lb dog which isn t great because it s not what i wanted but i accept it the rescue also said she s a sweet loving little girl dudes she s scared of her own shadow literally she s run away from her own shadow before and large leaves that suddenly get picked up the wind and stationary objects like trash bins or parked cars if i wasn t playing with or petting her within the last few minutes she won t come to me because she s too scared and i ve been working with her for almost a full year now i mean she s much better than she was but if i move too fast around her she still gets scared as hell listen adopting from rescues is great but stop pretending all rescues are great and they ll come into your home as the perfect little or big pet some of them have major issues either physical or emotional and not everyone is willing or able to deal with a situation like that sure try to find a good reputable breeder and sure this guy said he didn t care about being from a breeder or finding anything out about the breeder but also not everyone read that comment before condemning him just stop being so damn judgemental
this dog looks way too young to be separated from its momma
i want to ask a question and i hope someone can answer is dog breeding much worse in the us i know that cruel puppy farms exist here in the uk but it seems that most places you can get a puppy either pay or free are just people whose pet dog has given birth there‚Äôs still a big ‚Äúadopt don‚Äôt shop‚Äù movement here but it‚Äôs certainly not safe to assume that all or even most cases where someone buys a dog it comes from some horrible puppy farm like all the comments on here are assuming what is the deal in the us regarding that
it s not this cute little guys fault he was bought he s adorable now go make a donation to your local shelter and tell everyone on this thread to shut the f ck up you get it now
bought bought have you ever thought to adopt a pet from a shelter so you don t support the torturing of animals
no matter the source all the pets of the world need homes you probably saved coconut from euthanasia the politically minded fools in this thread aren t concerned with coconut s welfare you are maybe the solution to the backyard breeder problem does involve innocent animals dying but not this animal and this animal what this thread is about you have nothing to be ashamed of
i m for adoption and against back yard breeders i live in tampa fl and we ve been looking for another dog for a few months now all the normal shelters are almost all pitbulls or some variation of them nothing against the breed but we simply can t have them where we live and i have small dogs it s actually been quite difficult to find another dachshund chihuahua maybe a corgi something that would fit our lifestyle and where we live not fair for us to adopt any dog that expect high energy run walks per day or a big yard we go for walks but only about min x a day sometimes there just aren t really any suitable dogs at the shelters and it s been this way for awhile
good for you but but pleas next time and yes there will be a next adopt don‚Äôt shop too many good dogs in the world who need a home
don t listen to most of these millennial twats most dogs at shelters are not good for adoption they re often not well socialized or trained you don t know their history or anything plus you miss the cute puppy phase
me don‚Äôt say it me don‚Äôt say it me don‚Äôt say it me don‚Äôt say it me don‚Äôt say it me don‚Äôt say it me don‚Äôt say it me don‚Äôt say it me don‚Äôt say it me coconut
maine coon or norwegian forrest cat probably gorgeous
well its a maine coon so theres no doubt in that plus its grey with a bit of black
i have a maine coon i love em this cat has the same look and color blotches on her face and such as the cat i have just her fur is a different color as mine is brown black and her fur has a bit missing due to burs i sadly had to cut out i couldn t get out that sadly really was hurting her and i had no choice regardless i love them and all cats cats cute motherfuckers and she catches and eats many mice she literally will eat most of it after catching it and i ll find just the tail and hind legs remaining crazy but she s the best cat i ve had for sure getting old she is but she s still got a lot of play and energy thought i d share
wonderful pic of the wonder innocence and curiosity of young animals
gt my phone camera i always want to believe i think i do this time
having a good day today but this still brightened it
looks like my baby cousin when i let her play my talking angela on my phone and the next thing you know there are a million selfies of her forehead oh my phone
every day is bad but this little kitty makes this one a little less anyone ever think how awesome it would be to be a cat or some other pet sure you can t open your own cans of food and are prone to licking your own ass with a sandpaper tongue think of all the upside though no existential dread no wage slavery no worries about family or relationship issues that aren t solved by a good staring contest etc and best of all some miserable ape like us to take care of you
this looks like my little girl before she got chonky
i read that as here s a young camera discovering my phone kitten
thanks op i really needed that would love to see more pics of that cutie too üò∏
just seeing this picture made me involuntarily say look at that cat so it think it worked üòÅ
i do not look nearly as adorable when i open my front facing camera as this good boi or girl does
looks like ron burgundy when he was in his downward spiral and had that full beard
the way his little ear rocks back and forth once he looks down is just too cute
ya but hes cutw i just look like a loaf of bread with my double chin
no way in hell do i look that cute from that angle or any angle
i wish i looked this cute when i opened my front camera
i m when i accidentally open my front camera i give that sort of look then dissolve into wracking sobs as i wonder where my life went
does he look a little bit like sam from lord of the rings
the first thing you see when you die and go to heaven
i don‚Äôt know why but this made me think he‚Äôs a blue collar dad of two
that s the look of a dog that s about to boop some snoots
it‚Äôs cause we‚Äôre looking down exposing our double chin we didn‚Äôt think we had lol
i wish i looked this good when i opened the front camera
this is my favorite view of a dog if that makes sense ü§î
this good boi looks like roger clark another good boi
have an upvote as it remind me of our dog she was irish setter the most beautiful one ever she had teeth deformity that s why she didn t participate in any shows but she would ve won them all easily i am sure of it either way i wake up hungover turn over on saturday from left to top view and this is what i see a loving dog face and she waited just for me to turn so she can lick my face and try to push her away no she has a task in her mind she has to wake me up
to get this effect easily lay down beside your bed have dog on bed have dog ponder wtf you re doing
this does actually make me feel a little better if i were furry with floppy ears even i would be cute
holy shit this dog looks just like roger clark guy who does the voice for arthur morgan in rdr
karen how do turn this thing on oh its on now which one is facetime
i lay on my floor on my back to get this view from my neighbors dog when they come over
looks like my old man when he makes video call instead of voice call
i wish i looked that cute in my front facing camera
only i have a double chin and don‚Äôt look this fucking adorable
why does this dog remind me so much of will farrell
i dont know why but when i look at him i think of chris hemmsworth thor
this was me when i strapped my gopro hero on my bike it was just a bunch of stills and second clips of my face upside down because i didn t read the manual
this pup looks like roger clark the voice of arthur morgan
i was expecting the dog to bite the camera and for it to fade to black then transition to either the dark souls you died screen or the intro to skyrim
how nearly everyone over the age of gets their profile picture
i feel like that dog had a sense of self awareness when he saw his own reflection and then immediately shook it off when he caught himself
this is me except i always get startle like who s this double chin mf oh wait üòÇ
me ooooft due to anything in the area between nipples and knees having just had a golden retriever land on it dog oh good you‚Äôre awake breakfast my morning view for the last years same baggy face and uncontrollable tail movements can‚Äôt get mad at that face
how could dogs and cats look good in any angle and people like me look trash in any angle
i don‚Äôt know why but he strikes me as a bob kind of guy
when you open your front facing camera but it doesn t matter because you re beautiful
if dogs spoke i d expect arthur morgan s voice out of this pup
almost accurate he s missing the look of disgust right at the end
thos dog resembles chris hemsqorth to me for some reason
okay that looks like the guy from elf what s his name
why he look like a disappointed dad looking at the second born at the older sibling s graduation
he looks like my mom trying to read something on my phone lollllll
double chin squished up eyes yeah looks about right
i wish i wad this cute when opening my front facing camera
no one looks nearly this good when they get caught by the front camera
i upvote this because i just did it and i bet i look just like that
big dogs looking down is probably one of my favorite things in the world
to whoever is reading this i hope you have the best day ever remember who is the greatest you
that s the look my parents gave me that one step before i knew they were about to snap
i have literally never looked that cute in the front facing camera
damnit such a surprise and a treasure this will be when in the future this doggo has moved on
yeah but i m not that cute so i close my front camera immediately
and i always look around in hopes that no one seen my face before i could switch to rear facing in seconds
i‚Äôm suppressed breath giggling in my bed next to my sleeping wife this is hilarious
front facing cameras cause body dysmorphia maybe has anybody ever recorded themselves talking on their camera so they know what they really look like
dog stares at the camera so long that it‚Äôs just impossible not to laugh
don‚Äôt know why but that dog reminds me of chris hemsworth
reminds me of that video where shaquille o neal realises a kid is filming him during a photo
anyone interested in my art or if anyone wants me to paint their pet please pm me
i love it the pink is a fantastic contrast to the kitty to make him or her pop out but not too much the details on kitty are still very evident and you can tell you put a lot of love and effort into it
commissions i have two pets that i love very much and something like that would be beautiful
i think it‚Äôs very beautiful i also love the pink you are very talented artist üë©‚Äçüé®
how much i would very much love one of my two kittens i will gladly pay for that
i love it it‚Äôs helping me get the courage to try painting mine
my year old son loves cats more than anything this picture made him hug my phone
this is amazing especially for watercolor it looks so realistic
stunning love the colors and the expression only constructive criticism is that the head seems a little big for the body i‚Äôm guilty of that every time i draw animals prepare your inbox for commission requests you‚Äôre a talent
simply gorgeous you ve got a wonderful sense of texture there you really captured the fluffy floofiness er floofy fluffiness er fliffy the cat looks really huggable ok ü§™ü§™
cherry leaves in the background here take my orange arrow
that is the cutest i could watch a good hour or more of the puppy pan diving competition
i think this husky will go snorkelling on holiday and is already practising in his water bowl to breath out calmly under water
nobody husky pupper grbrbrbbrbrbbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbbrbrbrbrbrbrbrb breathe grbrbrbrbrbrb
ok i am way to high to be coming across this stuff right now i laughed way to hard at this
yep him with his water and me with my chocolate milk
i was wondering when he was going to come up for airl i was holding my breath along with him and nearly died haha
i have a video of a bear doing this at a sanctuary the audio is terrible though so i d feel obligated to gif it first if i were to share it with the world
my yellow lab does this he also scoops up a mouthful then tilts his head down slowly watching the water slowly pour back into the dish hes a special boy
i thought huskies were just permanent petulant toddlers
it would be funnier if he peoceeds to dive into his buddies bowl
i clearly can see that little fella jumping around just being happy
its all cute and stuff until you literally have them go underneath the electric wire and eating our neighbours crops
this is the song that never ends yes it goes on and on my friend some people started singing it not knowing what it was and now they are still singing it just because
after watching drag me to hell everytime i see a lamb it reminds me of that demon lamb and it s funny or was it a goat
you‚Äôre garden is beautiful and green and the ü¶ä made my day such playful souls thanks for capturing the magic
get a ball and next time they re out there toss it to the and see what they do with it
baby foxes are on my family crest this is the first time i ve seen real ones in action though and i might need to have a word with the designer lol
this sub is making be believe every briton with a garden has a fox family living in them
these foxes prancing about the greenery make my day
how lucky you are thank you for providing a place for them
arizonan here i can only dream to have a yard this beautiful
what disney movie do you live in and how did you get there
your garden is so beautiful it makes them look like little pokemons
i‚Äôve got loads more videos of the family in my post history if anyone wants more there are five cubs in total
i have a very young family of foxes living under my deck if i walk out there my legs will be covered in fleas i used to think foxes were cute üòï
ahh how i love early summer the bright green is just full of life
that gardrn makes me feel like two victorian ladies are about to cross through on their way to have tea with a duke at table just off camera
i love your garden in the wilderness do wolves visit your garden sometimes
thank you for blessing my timeline with this gem ‚ù§Ô∏è
beautiful post thanks for keeping up the quality on reddit
i never see anything that green been in the desert too long lol
it‚Äôs all fun and games until they dig into your cider cellar
seems like everyone got foxes in their garden except for me
if there s a bustle in your hedgerow don t be alrmed now it s just the capering of vulpine kits
reminds me i need to go give my shooberoni a big hug and a belly rub
my duck army is on the march to conquer the non believers they will tremble at our coming our feet will grind their bones to dus ooooh a puddle
cute but fyi ducks can bite learned this the hard way by trying to pet one
kinda reminds me of a can of fishing worms squirming
this is how i want to go if i am in hospice or such just unleash the puppies
it blows my freaking mind that great danes can have this many puppies
the best kind of infestation bring them all to my house
oh no look at the poor man being mauled by all those vicious looking animals i hope his therapy worked for him
we had bunnies the first time we took them to the vet she was like a little kid ‚Äúcould we let them all loose in the room at the same time please i never get to be around this many bunnies ‚Äù and then we all sat on the floor
this is terrible there aren t nearly enough people in that room to pet all those puppies i volunteer as tribute
after all those people go through that sounds like a good way to destress
that vet has nowhere near enough nipples for that lot
weimaraners often have large litters i have lived with three puppies to life companions who all came out of litters this size
where s the vet i i don t know the puppies dispersed and he was just gone
little me thought this was the typical work day a vets the first time i took my dog to the vet was the day my dream of becoming a vet crashed and burned all they did was use a rectal thermometer but the betrayal that flooded my dog‚Äôs eyes when she realized that my mother her favorite person helped this stranger hold her down to take her temp hurt me so bad i never wanted any animal to look at me like that it looked like her entire understanding of the world caved in on her the good part about that day is that we were totes best buddies because she had no one else gt
midway he makes a fast ear check i m working this is all hard work
one of my dogs is from this litter they re blue great danes
something that i really find fascinating about dogs is that even from puppyhood they seem to have a fondness for humans just see how they gravitate to that vet as if he is a magnet
where s the dog cloning factory oh right they re terribly common üò•
if i could this just a few minutes everyday i am sure i could off my meds lol
what‚Äôs up with cats and cherries mine does that too
where is this i can t figure out the language printed on the coke bottle
video ended too early i wonder where he went with the cherry
cherries are lethal to cats eh especially the pit which contains traces of cyanide just a friendly heads up dogs too
me getting cookies from the office s tin after i ve told everyone i m on a diet
poor kitty hope they have the sense to put it down in time
a little thief has stolen not only a cherry but my heart as well
i like to see the person in the background making cherry coke the authentic way
but what is the person wearing a dress a blanket an elaborate camouflage
that one cherry costs about cny close to cents in usd
for some reason this reminds me of in pocahontas when the raccoon keeps stealing the dog‚Äôs cherries
my cat had bowl surgery to remove cherry pit that tore his intestines horrible experience for cat
so cute but sorry little paw they captured you on the camera d
as much as i dislike cats they seem so much more funny and deliberate in what they than dogs
you people are a lost fucking cause stop breeding these stop thinking its cute its fucking horrible and so are you
this cat has the shortest legs i ve ever seen it s like the dachshund version of a cat
stop fucking breeding cats with short legs you sick fucks
poor little mutant those stupid little legs make that cats life unnecessarily difficult
why would you breed an animal that loves jumping and running to have short legs so fucked
dachshund cat hybrid with the personal property morals of a ferret
what the hell cat what s wrong with your legs any shorter and they ll have left you propped up on bricks
good thing they re too busy looking at their phone to see me
people are evil as fuck breeding animals just so they are cuter eventually we end up with abominations like the pug
that post description was perfect made me laugh so hard
she is so cute and pretty thief who is stealing the cherrie
i can hear the mission impossible music when watching this
oh my gaaawd she probably thinks she caught a mouse
i don t usually like cat stuff but this is painfully cute
who the fuck keeps cherries in a bowl by the side of their bed
sorry for your lose remember all the good times you guys had together
i m so sorry for your loss he looks like he was a really god boy
just this side of heaven is a place called rainbow bridge when an animal dies that has been especially close to someone here that pet goes to rainbow bridge there are meadows and hills for all of our special friends so they can run and play together there is plenty of food water and sunshine and our friends are warm and comfortable all the animals who had been ill and old are restored to health and vigor those who were hurt or maimed are made whole and strong again just as we remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by the animals are happy and content except for one small thing they each miss someone very special to them who had to be left behind they all run and play together but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance his bright eyes are intent his eager body quivers suddenly he begins to run from the group flying over the green grass his legs carrying him faster and faster you have been spotted and when you and your special friend finally meet you cling together in joyous reunion never to be parted again the happy kisses rain upon your face your hands again caress the beloved head and you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart then you cross rainbow bridge together
he looks like one of those once in a lifetime pets my heart goes out to you
"the most honorable thing any human can do is make the right decision for our pets i had to let our family dog of years go and it was for her many people want animals to live forever regardless of their health and that‚Äôs a cruel and selfish approach he‚Äôs in heaven with my susie qüôèüèª
it will get easier and just remember all the love he brought to your world we all are better for the love that an animal brings to our life"
he‚Äôs family just as much as the rest of your family i‚Äôm so sorry my heart hurts for you cause i‚Äôve been there a few times
we just lost my daughter‚Äôs dog she‚Äôs in london and will be returning to an empty house it‚Äôs heart breaking i‚Äôm so sorry for your loss
boxers are magnificent only problem they don‚Äôt live long enough
he ll always be by your side just in a different way now‚ô•Ô∏è
there is no equal to the love of an animal what a blessing you were to each other my deepest sympathy
blowing kisses to heaven for your doggo my luke will keep him company while they wait for us
it‚Äôs so hard to lose such a piece of your heart and life sending you a virtual hug
cute but not sure about full time job once a year would be good
looks like you could get that job in an impoverished third world country
job requirements you have to be an elephant you must be under years old and above years old must have ability to play with water cutely should not be afraid of camera willing to work with non native customers
god that elephant is just so happy the visual representation of happiness
imagine giving birth to that thing amp x b fuuuuuuuukk
it is so one of my bucket list items to get to personally interact with a baby elephant
you do realize that the person who gets to clean the elephants cleans everything including their poop right
well you gotta go to usc and be comfortable making minimum wage after graduation pretty much all it could take i bet
r kelly will gladly let you do this if you are a female under
the funny thing is the poor worker is just trying to keep that mini pool filled no one told him nothing about a baby elephant
lol professional elephant bather what a thing to put on your resume
oh my gosh i m so glad to read that you don t have cancer you are so beautiful and confident and you have a lovely kitty
don t mean this in a rude way but do you have cancer it looks like you have no hair and i think chemo kills hair cells
reminds me of my cat i taught him to headbutt when he was a kitten and if he really liked you he d give you a headbutt when you weren t expecting it i lost him a couple of years ago i still have his sister and she ll occasionally give out a headbutt she was the more independent of the two
side note if you wanna see more of bart he does have an instagram because i‚Äôm that kinda crazy cat lady feel free to follow him bartthemeatball
op i am loving your lipstick would love to know brand and name if you care to share you and your kitty are beautiful
he‚Äôs so like ‚Äúwait pose with me c‚Äômon let them all gaze upon our beauty ‚Äù lol what a charmer
bart reminds me of my childhood cat so much he s adorable
everyone wants to touch the bald head keep your filthy paws to yourself
how old is he he still has young kitty fuzz in his fur lt
some cats are attention monsters and those are the best cats
i swear kitty nuzzles are the best in the world my little donut jr takes every chance he can to nuzzle my face if he gets on a high enough perch
you need a healthy supply of glasses cleaners with a cat like that i have two dogs that always manage to give mine a good smear before i head out for the day
why d you do it i get that she was abusive but you had no right to kill her
coming from someone with alopecia areata this melts my heart you are beautiful and i hope that i have this much confidence someday ‚ù§Ô∏è
this one is even more wholesome because you found her people ü•∞
the were very happy to have her back she seemed to have a very loving family
i found the sweetest cat hanging around our lakehouse last summer i took her to the vet and they found a microchip the vet left a message for the owner saying i had found her cat and to call me asap days later her owner finay called me and just said i don t want her back you figure out what to do with her and hung up broke my heart for the poor little baby
and here s a tip if you got temporarily acquainted with a dog or cat you found and are heartbroken because you had to return your new buddy remember that shelters everywhere are full of absolutely awesome animals who desperately need your love and the comfort of a new home we adopted our cat a few years ago and later brought a stray in and could t wish for more awesome animals my life would definitely be much worse today without them
"cute your laundry basket is the same as
mine when i was a kid has it for plus years then it broke on me we used to sit in it and slide down the stairs brought me back"
she was probably daydreaming and forgot how to get back home silly kitty
i have a cat that had ended up getting lost last year that looked quite similar to this one and i would like to say thank you for putting in the effort in letting the owners get reunited when we found the posters it was a huge relief it s certainly a joy when you get an actual chance to be re united with a friend you thought lost
i‚Äôve spent too many years with cats to know you took this picture at a dangerous time
yeah she was very playful at the time she jumped out at me just after i got the picture lol
it was definitely a plesure to get her back to her family she was very loving and playful and im sure they were devastated when they lost her i know i would have been she was great kitty for the week or so we had her
in the us we refer to them as ‚Äúcougars‚Äù but she doesn‚Äôt look old enough to be one of those
this is fascinating i would be terrified close to an animal that can end end my life in a blink of an eye
cheetahs actually don‚Äôt look as fierce as i thought they look so cute
do you have any idea where that tongue has been not to mention the cheetah s tongue
i‚Äôve felt my cat‚Äôs tongue when she licks me and it‚Äôs rough i wonder if a cheetah‚Äôs is any rougher if so ouch
they forgot to show the part where her skin was gone due to the aggressive sandpaper tongue super cute though
she can be my cheetah girl of course i mean the animal
i have a friend who had a bucket list item to pet a baby cheetah how we do dis
that awkward moment when even the cheetah has a cute gf and you‚Äôre still single
can someone please post this another five times before i go to bed tonight
it must be such a cool thing to be able to bond with a cat that size judging by house cat tongues i bet that feels awesome too
this is cute until you realize that cheetah just ate the ass out of a gazelle
i had the opportunity to be licked by a cheetah roughest tongue you could ever imagine
that s adorable and everything but i definitely wouldn t want to be that close to a cheetah or any other large predatory animal like that
i cccccaaanttt stop licking ohh nooo i cccccaaaannnnttt stooooppp
cheetahs just seem like the chillest of the murder machines that giant cats are
what is the nature of this animal are they calm by default or mostly hostile
everyone is talking about the cheetah but the girl is super cute
her instagram followers most cool cat story i‚Äôve ever seen
no one will ever know but there is a human inside this cheetah loving how he gets taken care of by this stunning ladie or got eaten alive
you think she cheetah on her boyfriend with this cat
whatever kind of schooling i need to get here i‚Äôll do it
i recently saw this how men vs women take pictures meme and god damn is it accurate any time i see a video or picture where it s a person unnecessarily in the picture it s always a woman i ve seen like just on this sub over the past few days
i‚Äôd like to exchange kisses with the caretaker hot dayum
can they mosey any faster the sight of the truck gaining speed is frightening
"a moose once bit my sister no realli she was karving her initials on the moose with the sharpened end
of an interspace toothbrush given her by svenge her brother in law an

dentist and star of many norwegian movies the hot hands of an oslo
dentist fillings of passion the huge molars of horst nordfink mynd you moose bites kan be pretti nasti"
is this cropped to a square because another dumbass recorded vertically
rdr ‚Äúwow what a rare creature time to take its skin‚Äù
i was sitting there eyeing that truck thinking he better slow the fuck down cause if not i m gonna be pissed
rip to my anxiety watching that truck going towards them
aren t we gonna acknowledge the fact that the truck ws coming right at this car on the wrong lane
according to celtic welsh myth animals that were white and had pink ears came from the otherworld and were forbidden game for mortals i can see why
if you got a problem with canada mooses you got problem with me and i suggest you let that one marinate
likely around the kelowna kamloops area seems to be lots of albino moose genes floating around in that population
it‚Äôs never a good idea to give locations for these animals or even give people an idea of what province it‚Äôs always a shame when they are hunted due to their uniqueness so be sure not to provide details on locations even when they are near a protected area like a national park
oh wow eh what a beautiful couple of moose fucken eh man
i saw the hump on the moose‚Äôs back shoulder and all i could think of was ‚Äúcanadian camel‚Äù my brain is weird
is it bad that i thought the older moose would get ran over by the lorry
that s not awww thats aw hell no moose are fuckin mean they ll kill you without a second thought and that one is probably some sort of alpha
source lisacubbin on twitter his name is mr mcgregor from his profile black and white merle seal english bulldog named after thenotoriousmma l like sneaking things out the house üì∑ and putting them in the garden location liverpool
i did not see the dog at first he is really good at hiding in plain sight
the doggo is adorable but that chair looks like it s been shat upon by a thousand pigeons
there is no dog here i m reporting you for being off topic
for one split second i thought this ball of cuteness was all white as was the couch and he had gotten into an actual gallon of cookies and cream ice cream üôàüòÇ
is the chair supposed to look like that it looks like it was in a building that caught fire and then it was left exposed to the elements to mold over after it rained
cute dog burn the couch and throw the ashes in a fire
you might have to look before you sit down in that chair
did you buy the chair to go with the dog or the dog to go with the chair d lt
yeah is that mold on the chair or is that the why it was made
i‚Äôd be goddamn well scrambling around the house in a panic wondering where the pup went the first time that happened lol
if you don t behave you will end up like your brothers and sisters
the chair is made out of the skin of the previous litter
that‚Äôs a real sweetheart ‚ù§Ô∏è i‚Äôve always loved juvenile cows grew up around cattle farms
nice title stealing that‚Äôs been reposted a million times and there are plenty of cows posted on here
dissapointed with the lack of complete cows on this subreddit only front legs allowed
where did you get the white fur blanket you have on him ikea
you and the other people posting cows pics just today said the same thing i don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a shortage of cows anymore
right i almost unsuscribe from aww every week because i‚Äôm sick and tired of cats but i end up staying for cuties like this seriously look at this lil nugget you just want to kiss this nose and cuddle
don t know what you mean i see cows here from time to time
belted galloway i m not mistaken dad used to breed them
not trying to be rude but at first glance i thought it was a very large mailbox
as someone who doesn t eat meat anymore is there a responsible way to consume cheese i can do without milk but i can t get over my slave cheese
do you own this cow is he a dun belted galloway he is adorable
well i guess it s probably because they were somebody s lunchü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
reddit needs to dial back a bit on the cow if you ask me
there are plenty of cows on this subreddit just not the animal type
i‚Äôve seen different pictures of cows with the same title on here for years cows are cute too but can you guys come up with your own titles thanks
except it s flooded by cows pretty much every week or so
oh jeez here come the vegans you can t be throwing cows around on this the most judgmental of subs
in space you cannot hear moooooooo surviving mars project laika
cows are ugly and ungainly in my opinion amp x b this was is less ugly in the degree that it doesn t look all that much like a cow
the average human has a cat or dog or a friend with a cat or dog but i can t think of too many people with cows
you re a little late to the party bucko but cows are perfect so yes keep posting them
you should come to india then there‚Äôs too many of them and they are all cute
the issue is that every time someone posts a cow the comments have to be locked because it turns into a vegan vs non vegan flame war
my favourite farm animal longhorn cows specifically
i met a calf once who had a perfect on her forehead and she was adorable and i loved her so much man and now is my lucky number
i live in farm country i see enough cows thank you very much lol
do you know what breed she is looks like a lab but i also see some collie in there
love how much more she is standing tall in the second pic she s obviously in a great loving home
awww she looks so vulnerable in the left pic but totally happy in the right great job üëç
she looks identical to our girl who is a golden retriever mixed with a boarder collie
i am certain she is happy and in love with her family lt
i couldn‚Äôt believe the change in personality when i brought my shelter cat home makes me wonder how many poor pets go unadopted because they just don‚Äôt shine in such a scary stressful place üòû
it‚Äôs almost as if she‚Äôs smiling she certainly looks happy to be yours
my girl also had a really sad adoption photo when i look at it again it just makes me glad i found her kudos on choosing rescue
this is why you should adopt a dog from a shelter instead of pupys from bread breeders
she looks so much happier hope you have many many years with her
of course she is don‚Äôt you see the change she looks like one happy doggo
she looks so happy what we can t see on the picture is her wagging her tail i m sure of it
she looks exactly like my dog newfoundland rottweiler
they call two color cats like that piebald so she‚Äôs a piebald tabby call her whatever you want though she‚Äôs adorable
he looks like a tabby to me fwiw there are very few male calico cats so if he‚Äôs a he he‚Äôs most likely not one
he would be a tabby genetically almost all calico cats are female and according to my vet any calico cats born male which is extremely rare are sterile a calico is white orange and black in colour any other colours such as white brown and beige etc are tabby source answers from my vet when i asked about my calico fur daughter he is a gorgeous tabby cat üêà üòª
your majestic floof boy is a beautiful piebald brown tabby he has an m on his head dead giveaway for tabby cats
tabby there are no actual orange patterns he s beautiful regardless
i thought the same of my cat he‚Äôs male he is much nicer than my calico i didn‚Äôt know calicos had a reputation though lol
tabbies often have the white paws and white nose front but he has bigger white patches than normal which makes him look a bit like a calico handsome guy
i looked at the other pictures you link on imgur he really is a beautiful cat and in some of the pictures his spots do look quite orange it s only that he is a male that makes me so sure he isn t a calico enjoy with lovely spirited playful fluff boy üòªüòª
sadly all of the farmers markets i ve been to say no dogs allowed
i go places so my dog can get petted by strangers we did some yard sales this weekend and it might as well be trick or treating as much as she likes it oh aren t you so pretty what a good girl oh she s so sweet over amp over thank you good and kind people who greet and enjoy my dog when she s out
why can t people obey no animals allowed signs it s like the entitled assholes who bring their animals inside a supermarket fuck selfish people
agree one of my favourite things about just going outside in general is that there are dogs out there ü§ó
crazy how similar this looks to the dog i rescued last year
one of the reasons i never go places is because i want to touch everyone‚Äôs dogs but i know i can‚Äôt do that
at our old town we used to call the saturday farmers market the dog market because of all the doggos wandering around
patrick what do you normally do while i m gone wait for you to get back
i got a job that lets me take my dog to work soooo worth it
awww but now i feel that much more guilty for having to leave mine each workday at least they have each other
reminds me of a quote i ve heard before that goes something like your pet is a part of your world but to them you re their whole world good post my dog is currently the reason my legs are asleep but i gave him a head scratch
this weighs on me now that i can work from home one day a week i am more likely to get another dog
i miss my bassets i was their whole world and they were mine for yrs
awww i love my pup so fucking much and all dogs i love dogs
my cat probably is just happy the human can opener and poop cleaner is back
i can almost hear the tail wagging in the first picture
i miss seeing that reaction when i wake up still thank you for sharing his morning love ‚ù§Ô∏è
my lab shadow used to wake me up like this every morning but he would be standing on my chest trust me nothing gets your morning going a lb black lab standing on your chest with his face in your face lol
dogs are incredible üòç they ll wait for us to come to our senses and notice them
my dog will do this at night nothing like slowly waking up to a dim outline of a wolf shaped shadow at the edge of my bed she only does this when the blind pug needs to go out
our shih tzu kim may he be happy wherever he is üíïüåà used to do this all the time our mattress is on the floor and every morning i would see him standing by my feet intently looking at me and when he notices that i m awake he ll start giving foot and face kisses and jump around the room gosh i miss him so much
i‚Äôd give that snoot a boop and then roll out of bed to start my great day
is your dog blind or do you regularly sleep with your phone in a picture taking position
my dog used to do this the first pic makes me more convinced that dogs know when they re being adorable and they do it on purpose
the only word i have to describe this is ‚Äòprecious‚Äô
so you weren t awake when you took a picture of him with your phone in the first one
picture focusing brain waves on my hooman picture mission accomplished
nothing matches the unending daily enthusiasm for sharing love and connection that dogs have nothing
i have the same comforter has you lol and my dog does the same thing üòù
and then you get a face full of hot dog breath to wake up to
my pound miniature dachshund would first lay on my chest and when that failed would proceed to lay on my neck
dude i literally have the same dog golden r right i just woke up minutes ago and this is what she does too ahahah that s amazing
ok but he saw you take a photo and didn t realise you were awake i hope you don t let him drive
that is a cute face to see first thing in the morning
hey you you‚Äôre finally awake you were trying to cross the border weren‚Äôt ya
so when a dog watches you sleep it s called cute but when i do it it s called creepy and how did you get into my house i m calling the police
to be treasured by a dog is such an amazing experience your mere presence is pure joy to them it is something i wish everyone could experience at least once in their life
he is so adorable and cute i want to squeeze his cheeks ‚ò∫
yay time to go outside for a walk hahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
that moment when you realize that op is a sleep photographer
my step mom‚Äôs golden used to wake me up like this his expression was identical to these pictures he died a few years ago i still miss seeing that face in the mornings thank you for sharing your pup made me smile
the actual best part of waking up is snoot boops with your pup
makes me miss my ole girl she used to do this all the time she was a shepherd rottie mix who passed away just over two years ago
bullshit how did he not know you re awake when you had your phone in your hand taking photos people are stupid
it‚Äôs less creepy when pets do this than when your children do this
this is so precious especially the st picture for me awww
i have a springer spaniel and i can feel her looking at me with my back to her or if my eyes are closed as soon as i open my eyes or turn over she‚Äôs on the bed licks my face snuggles down and goes to sleep then a few minutes later she‚Äôs jumping around on the bed and on me wanting to go downstairs
you have no blinds or curtains on your bedroom window
this makes me miss the golden retriever we had when i was growing up ever morning my dad would open my door and she d come in wake me up like this getting a little teary just thinking about it
i wonder how long he was awake staring just waiting for your appreciation awww
i dont really like dogs this much but this makes me smile i love it
my dog does this until i open my eyes so naturally i try to keep them shut as long a possible lately she‚Äôs gotten impatient and tries kicking them open üôÑ
he didn t realize you were awake when you took your phone out to get the first picture yeah sure
my dog does it in the middle of the night when she s scared from bad weather but she makes sound with her mouth which wakes me up right away then she walks in my bed my bed is very high but so her legs are and curls on my chest becomes th of her size
do you also get the cold wet nose on your cheek to wake you up when it s time for a potty break my boy ringo wakes me up like clockwork at a m every single night so he can go outside and drop a duce admittedly it can be a little annoying at times especially after a long day at work but i d do anything for that dog
my sisters first doggo rip was such a gentle boy he would slowly tip toe into your room and actually whisper to wake you up so quietly and breathy it was so adorable her new dog however will creep in and then lick you right across the eyes
üé∂‚ù§üêæthe best part of wakin upüé∂ üé∂is lovin from yer pupüêæ‚ù§üé∂
my brother s huge rottweilers used to wake me like this but usually one would have a tennis ball in their mouth for me to throw lol that game is probably still not over she s just waiting for someone to throw it across the bridge they were such huge sweet puppies
my baby girl sleeps all night until i get up and then it s like she had cups of coffee she runs to get mommy a toy and bring it to me sometimes it s a prob tho bc my bf sleeps in and her tail is loud as a wrecking ball sometimes when he and i are both up she instantly thinks it s potty time and outside is one of her favorite thing in the world she also has the worst timing i sit down to relax and get into a show or game and there she is whining to go potty lol
my nephew used to wake me up like this on holidays and such then years later my son too scared the shit out of me every time
a picture in the sense that he is an animal but he does not betray
ahh the memories my black lab mix onyx would wake me up by staring at me every morning i miss her so
i also sleep with a gopro stuck to my head to catch the reaction of my pets
"have a lab too also have a gate lol
otherwise it‚Äôs on and off the bed kisses on the bed with a butt in the face a twirl ripping the covers up like digging a hole kisses a moment of bliss off the bed on the bed on his back having a crazy dream kisses butt in the face he has a whole sofa to himself and three dog beds but the bedroom gate gets open during the weekend after am and he gets a couple hrs with us‚ô•Ô∏è"
you wake up with your phone ready to take a picture
how did you take the first picture without him realizing you were awake
how did you position the camera before you woke up tho
miss this my dog used to just attack my face with kisses he was a little dude though
must be nice to have a companion like that wish i had a dog i m and have never owned a pet in my life not even a goldfish
i‚Äôm guessing you took the first one while you were asleep
lucky mine just jumps on my pillow and puts his ass in my face
my dog will hear my alarm go off and then cuddle up next to me i set the alarm for minutes early to cuddle with her
my god he‚Äôs so adorable had to hold my almost year old yorkie today as a vet injected poison into her veins it was horrifying hold onto this good boy for dear life never take him for granted not that you do and on the days you get mad at him for destroying your favorite shoe or peeing on the floor remember one day you‚Äôll have to let him go and you‚Äôll wish you could take back every moment you spent being upset with him sorry to be a downer
how did you get a photo without him realising you are awake
mine little one is always in bed with me cuddling under the covers
so you managed to get your photo capturing device in hand line it up and take the first photo all before he realized you were awake
my dog will do this at night nothing like slowly waking up to a dim outline of a wolf shaped shadow at the edge of my bed she only does this when the blind pug needs to go out
because he didn t notice you were awake when you took a photo of him
when i was living with my roommates dog reef year old huskie lab mix we were together for years he used to jump on my bed and put his nose right in my face and huff and puff until i woke up and got out of bed then he would demand we go for a skate to the park pulls me on my long board for blocks then it was all ball for at least an hour great boy
who to the picture when you were ‚Äúasleep‚Äù then hmmmnnnmmmmmmmmmmm
honestly when i see pictures like this the love of a dog reminds me of the love a parent has for a child it s just an overwhelming sense of honest to goodness concern and love and admiration all boiled into one it s so pure undeniable if only the world lived like this everyday
dogs see only the best in the ones the love it‚Äôs wonderful
such a handsome doggo wow reminds me of my lab shepherd i had as a kid man such a loving dog but when he got out the fence he just took off jake loved to run damn i miss him sometimes even though i have two great dogs now
you only just woke up with that sun glaring through the window into your face like that do you even have eyes
tell him i said hi and that he s a good boy will you
if he still thinks you re asleep in the first one how did you get a photo how did the dog not notice you getting out your phone and taking a picture the whole time he stared at you
so you managed to take a picture without him realising you were awake
how could you take a photo without him realizing you were awake
how did you get the first one did you wake up and whip out your phone and take the picture before your dog somehow didn‚Äôt notice you were awake what is this
my beagle just puts his head on my thigh when i wake up so i don t ever move
we let our dog sleep in the bed with us if you make eye contact with her in the morning she rolls over and tries to get belly rubs
my lab shadow used to wake me up like this every morning
ugh this hit me right in the feels reminds me of my lab we lost years ago i miss this view
aww i hope you booped the snoot lmao what a good boi
so you managed to grab your phone and snap the left pic before he realized you re awake okay
thank you for the gold stranger just to clear things up for those asking i took these after a nap and i was already on my phone he usually can‚Äôt see if i‚Äôm awake until he puts his head on the bed and i managed to snap these two when he first looked and when he saw i was up totally not perfect but i can confirm that this is my view every morning and i hope it will be for a long long time to come
dogs are the best i miss my girl it seems she knew when i was waking up and would sniff my ears i wake easily around the same time every morning like am and then we go for a walk
this dog s thought process wakeupwakeupwakeupwakeupwakeupwakeupwakeupwakeupwakeupwakeupwakeupwakeupwakeupwakeupwakeupwakeupwakeupwakeupwakeupwakeupwakeupwakeupwakeupwakeupwakeupwakeupwakeupwakeup oh hai you re awake awesome you re awesome i m awesome lets go be awesome love you
how were you able to take the first picture without your dog realizing you were awake lol
how did you take a pic without him realizing you‚Äôre awake
so he was staring at you while you picked up your phone to take a photo but he didn t realize you were awake until afterwards so sick of posts like these and the likes my dog is so happy he is smiling when he is actually just panting dogs don t smile
my dog sleeps on my bed and i can tell he s ready for his morning walk because he starts sighing when i ve slept in
i had a great dane that would come and boof at me softly progressively getting louder and louder if i didn t wake up or she would lick my face and push on my head with her snout when i finally opened my eyes she would be giving me this same look god i miss that dog
my german shep dane as a puppy would start in the living room with the loudest squeaky toy and run down the hallway squeaking as much as doggily possible until he arrived in my room and would press the toy against my face and squeak until i woke up talk about unbeatable alarm clocks
i know that dogs don‚Äôt express emotion like we do so they‚Äôre not technically smiling but look at that smile
he couldn t tell you were awake by the fact you were taking his picture
i had to watch my friends dog when he was a puppy he would literally jump on my face when i was sleep to wake me up it was the most disrespectful week but he was so cute looking like he never did anything wrong
the dog is me when i was little and i wake up my parents at am
but you re obviously already awake in the first picture or you wouldn t be taking a photo
my rottie wakes my teenage son up by sprawling on top of him and licking his face ü§£
as opposed to my boy cat who cries an hour and half before his feeding time twice a day
i m so stupid i read kitchen and was wondering why i didn t see one
only remotes can be three inches or ten inches long
good luck that sweet kitty is gonna turn into a cat and do weird and frustrating cat things that annoy you
either that is a massive remote or that cat is tiny
wow so adorable such a beautiful sentient being i hope the ranch is a sanctuary for such sweet creatures and not a slaughter farm
wow i thought it was painting using prisma colors very nice picture
please no matter how old that sweetie gets do not turn them into food
looks almost exactly like the cow the use as labeling for certain types of dairy products name escapes me atm
i thougt it was the docor phil ranch for like a min
is this one going to be forcibly and perpetually impregnated like its mother when it grows up
how long before this sweet baby i slaughtered and eaten
jesus this thread is a trainwreck of militant vegans if anyone ever wonders why vegans face so much ridicule look no further than here this is a cute picture of a cute baby cow just say it s cute and move on
that moment when you just wanna cuddle with this baby but then remember that you probably will eat it when it‚Äôs grown up
jimmy stop taking pictures of the cow and get back on your horse
if you keep showing me cows this cute i m going to have to become a vegan
when did dr phil started inviting animals to his show
gorgeous precious little calf üíöüíöüíö shame hes gonna end up on someone s dinner plate though
where are all of these ranches i want to work on one
looks very irish but i realise it could be anywhere
seriously how can something be so adorable i can‚Äôt with this cuteness
i hope you don t send this little calf off to slaughter and i really hope you haven t separated her from it s mother
i work on a ranch and they are a lot of work but the little shits are cute it s fun to help a heifer or struggling cow give birth then watch as the calf that would have died slowly work up the strength to begin walking and feeding one of the things that makes the job worth it
be careful with bullies in the heat their shortened nose means they are unable to cool themselves off as easily as most dogs
i love her coat wanted a red white eb for some time now what‚Äôs her breeder‚Äôs name
congrats on your beautiful pet i take my dogs out very early and late when it‚Äôs hot especially with the american bulldog‚Äôs shorter muzzle not to mention the hot ground
damn that has to be the ugliest living thing i‚Äôve ever seen wtf
the poor thing can‚Äôt fucking breathe it‚Äôs disgusting
if you re going to adopt one of the many flat faced breeds of dog at least have the decency to live in alaska
get off your phone when driving you fucking balloon head
ü§¢ü§¢ü§¢ü§¢ gross put that deformed monster out of it s misery
it s almost obscene how much he s enjoying that a c
it‚Äôs like being outside the car while being in the car so therefore i can chase the car speech
cutie lt did you find her in the shelter i have never seen such an expensive dog up for adoption
its probably just struggling to breath because its been bread to not be able to function like a normal dog poor thing
comments here are pretty quick to judge this person a dog panting does not necessarily mean it‚Äôs struggling to breathe walking on a ‚Äúhot‚Äù day does not necessarily mean it‚Äôs too hot for this dog we don‚Äôt know the details here all creatures bred into existence deserve love this person has given this dog a home and does not appear to be responsible for breeding her the hope is that this person has researched the breed breed type and understands the limits they need to remain within to keep this dog happy and healthy but it doesn‚Äôt seem fair to judge them on a situation we don‚Äôt know much about
that smile makes me want to get a dog my cats would never forgive me
he is so happy and so beautiful the dog park is like the happiest place in the world it is like the only thing that wears my girl out
i don t know if i could take my lab to one she s been scared of other breed of dogs since a pitbull tried to attack her once and cowers even at yorkies she only likes her own kind and her friend down the road same breed but golden lab
got one of those for our cats you can put catnip in em one of them uses it regularly the other one won t touch it
my cat will only use hers if you touch it first but hold up a pair if scissors its face rubs all day
holy smokes i was thinking of making something like this for my cat wkth cheap brushes for when i m gone
that s adorable i also have one of these and hermes loves it
i have a legged cat and this is going to be her new favorite thing i know the stump twitches all too well shes usually making eye contact and is demanding scritches
posts pictures of his cat basically doing the same thing this guy knows what people like
i got one of these for my cat he knocked it off the wall with the double sided tape so we used screws and that worked better tad goes from ‚Äúah yes scratch my face‚Äù to ‚Äúimma chew on all the plastic things ‚Äù i think overall he likes it
definitely use the screws that came with it my kitty would knock it off too otherwise
not to harsh his bliss but you need to take that away from him before he chokes on it
my dogs rip out the squeaker first then they rip out the toy stuffing once the toy is just a deflated shell they fight over it until the arms and legs get torn off amp x b my dogs are miniature tornadoes of destruction
lol my dog does the same thing sometimes i think she is going to eat it but so far it s never been a problem
good boy ours takes out the squeakers as well only to pull out all of the stuffing and leave it all over the house
my dog rips open toys along the belly then rips out the stuffing from that hole until it‚Äôs a raggedy husk then forgets about it thought it was just a weird thing he did until he got hold of a stray cat that wandered into the wrong back yard turns out it was all practice
my goldens go right for the squeakers rip them out chew them up for awhile then insist i said insist on playing catch with the remaining fragment of plastic they will store these ridiculous fragments in their food dish where all of their best toys get stored not my idea
my beagle used to do this he d rip the squeaker out and using his front teeth squeak it until we all were going insane i d eventually have it sewn back into the toy since once they stopped squeaking he d stop playing with them wasn t smart enough to realize he was the one breaking them once the plastic squeaker would pop he d drop it in you lap and sit waiting for you to fix it again after the first time he did this i made sure there was more toys because i hated trying to explain to a dog why i couldn t fix it this time
my dog does this but we think it‚Äôs because she hates squeakers a lot
what kind of dog mine looks similar but he is a mutt part german shephard
please for the love of god people do not let your dogs chew on squeakers they will inhale them and they will get caught in their intestines and they will die in extreme pain without super expensive surgery it is not ‚Äúcute ‚Äù this is literally the equivalent of watching your baby try to stick a fork into an electrical outlet
this gives me anxiety especially when he started tilting his head with the squeaker in his mouth
what i need to know is where you got such a soft squeaker i swear the ones in my dog‚Äôs toys are supersonic
cute to watch but i have to second all the comments about not letting dogs chew on plastic crap they will swallow it it does have sharp edges it doesn‚Äôt show up on x rays it will lacerate the gi tract and it will cost you thousands of dollars your pet‚Äôs life or both one of our puppies an aussie shepherd loved to play with liter pop bottles on hardwood floors slipping sliding and raising a cacophonous din all very entertaining until our vet showed us a picture of another owner‚Äôs dog who had swallowed a bit of a plastic milk jug and died from internal bleeding and infection pop bottle game over find another toy for your pup they‚Äôll love it just as much and you‚Äôll get to love them a lot longer üëç
our jack russell does the same thing he uses the squeaks as money to buy treats with
i got squeakers offline then i was wondering what she was doing with them then one day i went on a walk with her and when she was doing her business i herd a squeak went to pick it up and there was squeakers needless to say she lost her squeaker privlages
this is a choking hazard oprah lost one of her dogs due to choking on a small object
what kind of cat is this they have the most beautiful eyes
i can not help laughing like an idiot when i see a cat that just got a bath
she looks like a mogwai who has just made the conscious decision to eat after midnight because she is tired of her human s shit
i thought you weren t supposed to bath cats at least my last two vets told me not to
it s actually the most attractive wet cat i ve ever seen
i want to rub him dry and brush him and read bedtime stories and tuck him in
oh my god it s a flying superhero cat photoshop him in a sky with a city background and add a cape bam supercat
ah yes an unintentional yet subtle senko san reference
why is it so smug in the bottom picture it s aura it s sheer power is quakingly strong
that is an inordinate amount of floof mixed with sass
looks so proud happy to be freshly bathed gorgeous kitty
this is cute but i also cringed a little bit cat looks like he was fully bathed and if water gets in a cats ear it can cause an infection so i can t help but think that when i see this
your cat looks fake and i mean that as a compliment somehow
the flower tile frightened me for a second because i thought the cat was bleeding
what you be lookin like when you get out of the shampoo bowl at the salon post blow dry
smug face corgi and smiling corgi here have an upvote
i literally saw that billboard a few hours ago and thought ‚Äúwow what a cute dog i wonder what the owner is like in real life‚Äù this is so wild
he s going to get all the bitches in the neighborhood now
you all may think corgis are these beautiful innocent dogs but i saw one out an overly anxious to play rottweiler in place once i m fairly certain that corgis are the shadow realms dominant dog
wait that s not cheddar it s just some equally awesome corgi pup
given that dogs routinely fail the mirror test is there any certainty he knows it s him in the picture
the dog doesn t know it s on a billboard and wouldn t give a fuck if it did it s a dog
i m mkre impressed that he made it though vet school
i dont think that your dog gives a shit if he is on some billboard
i mean he‚Äôs an amazing model has the perfect facial expression in both pictures
wow he has a perfect smile and is extremely photogenic he looks so happy and proud hel hes got alot to be happy and proud of the little bugga accomplished more than i have thats for sure
i m just going to say it this post is misleading your corgi found out nothing it s simply intrinsically fabulous
please give him the opposite of the bow tie idk what that s called lol
oh my god he s gorgeous deserves to be put up with a smile like that and those soft brown eyes and his reddish coat i m sorry hes beautiful
why do you look like a female swae lee with no tattoos and short hair
going psychological for a sec did he notice it did he notice himself or was it just another background detail for him
pretentious your dog doesn‚Äôt know that‚Äôs him he just wants to keep waking
elif why do corgis look like such majestic morherfuckers when pugs look like furry down syndrome kids is there less inbreeding with corgis
of course he most likely has no idea what that means he‚Äôs just happy to be happy i‚Äôm guessing good for him
next he will have an agent and new home and soon forget about ya üòÇ
i really think that corgis have the best smiles happy day
what i m not saying is directed to the title i think it s cute but this is a stupid question but dogs do not know what they look like right or so some do
he feels like a super star he is so cute very handsome doggy love you corgi
what an absolutely beautiful corgi you must be justly proud lt be still my beating heart x
why are traveling bets not a thing i have to wrap my cats like a burrito to get them in the carrier and they yowl the whole way to the office
that is actually the most adorable corgo i have ever seen
"looks a second time
dog wait that s not me in the billboard that s just some common bitch"
i honestly think the dog doesnt fully understand and even if he did know that its a picture of another dog or even him he doesn t care he d have this exact same face throughout the day brb heading to unpopular opinion
soon he will complain about the paparazzi harassing him
ahh cooper i‚Äôve been following you on instagram for forever so exciting to see you on a billboard where u deserve u sweet angel
i would like to have his paw print autograph since he is famous ‚ù§Ô∏è
your corgi s smile genuinely brightened my day thank you
i passed that billboard today and had a big smile for that sweet goofy photo what a cutie
it looks like he saw something that left him shocked and slightly grossed out
why you are so adorable you mean why are you so adorable
he looks like he saw something he shouldn‚Äôt have seen
simba theshortie is his instagram for anyone curious he s a munchkin
tube of powdery stuff next to the tail stiff and dilated pupils making soft meowing noises that roughly translate to there are so many stars stars everywhere in everything yep that s a tripped out cat d
i love this picture so much i don t care if it s a repost
i m not sold the larger one looks like it s about to do a surprise attack on the smaller one
whenever i see ears back i am expecting a sneak attack
that s about seconds before they started biting each other and establishing dominance
it s amazing how cats have the ability to be such a les an yet they can also be the perfect concept of love then again i guess we can too
i had this same combination of cats not sure why i m so excited about it
my cats look the same except they pretend to not be friends when we are around
seconds later chomp chomp chomp both cats run off into the other room
can anybody me else hear this pic like i hear purring when i look at it
there is more love in this photo than i think i will ever recieve
this is so sweet you can see the affection and love
i had to get rid of my cat because i became allergic the one on the right looks just like him
is this photoshopped the cat on the right looks like it s in different lighting
ha ha i cant relate to this affection amp x b amp x b
can someone explain why am i seeing gray cats that look identical to my cat literally everywhere on the streets movies posts and even on a bag of sand id bought for her why tf do gray look so alike
wait wtf my blue russian does not get along with my fin like the cat on the left at all fin just bothers him all day
just wait till both of them start a war on the table
literally have a pair of strays in my neighborhood that looks exactly like these two
his face expression is priceless hope that we all could find someone who look at us with that eyes
wish my cats would do that my big cat chases the small one all day instead
that looks like our cats tinycatandportland on instagram
the picture is cute but that caption is just absolutely darling
you ll be even more upset when they disappear from the planet thanks china
wallows better than me home alone on a friday night love pinecone dragon
pangolin exe has stopped oh wait no pretty sure it s working just fine
oh wow do they just love dirt i ve never seen this animal
is it trying to get the mud particularly wedged up in between the scales
yup aliens exist and i know it‚Äôs the mud squishing but i can‚Äôt help but imagine that it‚Äôs actually the pangalien‚Äôs sounds i‚Äôm hearing as its squirming it‚Äôs day away
isn t his name honeybun i think i saw him on a documentary
it‚Äôs cute now but if it grows to times the size and grows wings then i will literally kill myself
pangolins are my favorite animal if they were legal to own not endangered and easy to take care of i d have a dozen or so by now
i am severely disappointed in the pangolin deficit in this earth i demand more conservation
these remind me of armored kantuses from gears of war
you cannot imagine the time and effort i have put towards filming pangolins unfortunately they shy away from me do forgive this egregious failure
i love the fact that it just starts moving around more and more the longer the video goes on
can someone explain what is going on is it cooling off from the heat or something else
sometimes i wonder if animals are just humans that are reborn and now they are just trying out all kinds of shit
you caught him in a very embarrassing moment trying to give himself a bj
he‚Äôs just gettin his morning crunches in gotta get fit
i think if we could ever get a certain group of people to stop eating their scales in the misguided belief that they hold some magical cure all we might all be able to enjoy them for generations to come but since that is highly unlikely we better just enjoy them while they still exist
this made me anxious did the poor little guy end up ok or did he stay there stuck on his back and die
me trying to get out of that sizes too small dress i thought i d get my cinderella arse into
the sounds and visuals of this are unsettling to me
this just made me feel kinda uncomfortable and i don‚Äôt know why
sadly it s the world s most poached animal fuck you traditional chinese medicine
turned on the vid with my volume maxed out on my phone to the sounds of a lady saying he s gonna go in ohhhh and some slurping noises before i could turn off the sound this is what i get for being on reddit in work
gt pinecone dragon steve and b noises in the distance
what‚Äôr you doin silly you got the mites that dust bath seems a little wet don‚Äôt ya think good enough i guess lol
i m not myrmecophagous you re myrmecophagous that guy stole my blue lighter
unpopular opinion pangolins look horrible and scaley
never enough pango pinecone dragons ban poaching of pangolins before they re all gone chinese medicine made from their scales exactly the same keratin as in fingernails amp hair is not magical or effective eat your fingernail clippings instead üò†
there s something there for that actor that s a really cool connection
chewy meet and greet is amazing i swear they have onions hiding around him
i feel like you took yourself so you could see the star wars stuff using a baby that won‚Äôt remember it as an excuse not saying that‚Äôs a bad thing i would for sure do it too congrats and thank you for adopting
i‚Äôm sorry but why do people bring newborns to disney world i guess this is super cute and it‚Äôs great that they adopted but what‚Äôs the point
this is great and all but that kid must be fucking terrified
this is the kind of wholesome wookie content i got on reddit for
aww congratulations and thank you for adopting i hope you guys have many happy years together
best part is the smile on dad s face in the third picture congratulations to the new parents
congratulations may i ask how you went about the adoption did you go through the foster system
i don t know how i m somehow seeing so much emotion in the face of a masked actor portraying a non human character why am i crying anyway big congratulations on your adoption ü•∞
he‚Äôs the best my girlfriend sadly found out she lost her grandma while we were over on holiday from the uk she told him and he gave her the biggest longest hug he then noticed my han solo tattoo and did the same to me it really was magical
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è this totally made my morning congrats on the new bundle of joy and have a blast at disney world
apparently chewbacca costumes have a tendency to wear out quickly because everyone wants a hug
why would you take a newborn around a huge crowd of people that could possibly carry measles i don‚Äôt understand people
very cool i still remember giving chewy the biggest hug of my life when i went a few years ago
oh my gosh that‚Äôs amazing you two are amazing people
i‚Äôm adopted myself and i can‚Äôt tell you how happy this makes me here‚Äôs to many happy years
i love disney world one of the last bastions on earth where people families can go and just be happy
we went to disney in january and chewbacca was so sweet to my niece he took so much time with her and she loved it honestly every character was so happy and earnest it really is fun to see the unwavering cheerfulness of it all
how is the baby now how is it settling in to your new family
this is why we needed to stop the droid attack on the wookiees
why would you take a baby to an amusement park they don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening and it just annoys everyone else
that is super heartwarming and congrats on the growing family
i m going to disney in july and i m so excited to meet chewbacca this has me over the moon congrats on your adoption and on meeting chewy
babies should be banned from most places they are so annoying
congratulations on your growing family such a wonderful blessing
not a big baby person but this is super cute and congratulations on your new addition makes me happy to read that you opened your home to child in need of loving parents
headcannon cheese actor is adopted and feels big proud of this new family
congratulations the average year wait time for a chance of adoption is honestly sounding so soul crushingly horrible i m so happy for you what a lucky kid
i‚Äôm too pregnant for this type of content making me ball my eyes out look at the pride on his face when he shows off his daughter ‚ù§Ô∏è
those photos are absolutely precious what a great interaction with chewie amp x b congratulations on your adoption and best wishes for many amazing years with your little one
please tell me there s a video i need to see this play out in motion üòä
congratulations on your adoption what a wonderful way to celebrate
congratulations the cast members who play non verbal characters in full suits at wdw and dl are outstanding
i kept looking at the pictures trying to spot the doggo i thought maybe it blended with chewies fur left disappointed but impressed with doggo camouflage a full minute later i realised they adopted a human baby not an animal baby
well don t keep us in suspense what did the pendent say
makes me wonder if chewy actor playing him was adopted and you hit him right in the feels
she has an ig if anyone wants to see more the big eared shepherd
she is awesome love those ears so cute and they make her truly unique
she truly has two very big ears a big heart too i presume
she is all kinds of cute give her some cuddles and kisses for me ‚ô°
i love her ears she looks like anubis the ancient egyptian god associated with the underworld
me trying to scream in my dreams also fuck that‚Äôs cute
this has got to be one of the cutest things i ve seen on here
you ll never be a king of beasts with such a little roar
reminds me of simba in the lion king my heart is melting
do you mind posting a pic to compare she looks beautiful in the drawing though
of all your art this is quite possibly my favourite great work again mate
so cute i crept on your post history and you are so talented
i‚Äôve got a pittie mix rescue with the same brindle coat luna could be her twin great work
i play a game with my friend whenever we see a husky one of us says bet if the husky‚Äôs name is luna they have to buy me a beer we switch off
great drawing adorable what brand of markers do you use there the color is really great ink and technique alike
that brindle must have been hard to paint great job
i thought it says several kittens and was getting salty about there being only one but then it was ok anyways
collars without a quick release are extremely dangerous very easy for the cat to strangle itself
caracal kittens are better they sing like electric drills
omg but literally but this is the cutest kitty i ll ever seen in my life
haha i first read this as several kittens and wondered if they were real servals or savannah kittens
the comments read like an abbot and costello routine
first one ohh how do i murder it second one hey what are you looking at oh that yeah let s murder it
nobody someone makes a post with exotic animal reddit reeeeeeeee shitty pets bad human bad reeeeeeeeeeeeee no one here has the money to buy exotic pets and aren‚Äôt really looking to buy one anyways calm the fuck down
those aren t real totally fake nothing that cute actually exists
where are these kittens thos is a threatened species
i thought that said several kittens and when i watched the video i was like where the fuck are the other kittens

have you heard the calling of our lord and savior amphibious jesus
he‚Äôs waiting for you to step into his office so he can fire you
i don t know why but this reminds me of a neopet i haven t been on that website in like years
feng shui frog catching all the cash flowing out your door
he looks like he just got a call from your head teacher and is waiting for you
i had one of these mfs in my apartment the other day
why are frogs so dirty where i come from and this one looks so clean as if just gotten out of a shower
larry i need you to understand i care deeply for you but your drinking habit is destroying our family and you need to stop

this reminds me of timone he is a tree frog they have a peaceful vibe about them lol
he looks like a dad waiting up for his rebellious daughter at night
nobody absolutely no one on earth amp x b not even yo grandmommas grave amp x b frog well howdy there fellow human how might your day be goin

missed opportunity of a lifetime should have given him the prince a kiss

cute pic please take him outside so he doesn‚Äôt dry up üê∏ üíï
this is the most kermit looking live frog i have ever seen
or he knows someone who can save you on car insurance good day sir
there once was a therapist frog far better than owning a dog it ate all the flies and swallowed your lies and drowned all its sorrows with grog
so mr smith tell me why you believe we should offer you the position
i love frogs and toads so much he also looks like you re presenting him with a sales pitch in a meeting room
‚Äúyou could‚Äôve called to let me know you‚Äôd be late ‚Äù
he looks disappointed like i was expecting you at pm do you know what time it is now
he looks like he s waiting to hear why you went out dancin with that no good sullivan boy from the other side of the tracks and are just now coming home
he looks like he wants to listen to all of your problems
he kind of looks like he wants to tell you how you can save money on your car insurance
i ve seen that face before it s often followed by hi welcome home who is karen
oh he knows about your day now he just wants to hear your explanation
he s there like umm sooo yeahhhh i was ahhh told there would be a kiss waiting for me somewhere after i arrived
i m sure you re wondering why i ve asked you all here
coincidentally kaeru means both frog and to return come home in japanese because of this reason small statuettes of frogs often adorn the gate posts in front of peoples homes
‚Äúso why so late honey looking for another frog aren‚Äôt we ‚Äù
excuse me sir but do you have a minute to hear about our lord amp saviour tadpole christ
just give him minutes to save money on car insurance i know he s froggo but he s all we got

precious boy wants to know how much have you sinned today
‚Äúdo you have a few moments to hear about our lord and saviour kermit the frog ‚Äù

looks like he‚Äôs about to recite the whole bible at you
or he s your boss principal you ve f ed something up and he s waiting to tell you off write you up
i haven‚Äôt seen a tree frog in a very long time they were everywhere when i was growing up
i‚Äôm chris hansen why don‚Äôt you take a seat over there
i know it s tuesday but it was cheaper to get here a day early you know how those airline algorithms work
they always ask whats the frog doing not how is the frog doing frog holding back tears
he is waiting to hear about your day and to be fair you really should ask about the ups and downs in his day and when he answers try to be a good listener and whatever you do don t say ribit
he sure seems to have his undivided attention to you
he is there with an important message about your diabetuss
that s the face you make when you know exactly what happened and they re about to lie about it
do you have a moment to talk about our lord and savior kermit the frog
he seems like he wants to be heard than to hear someone
this sub lacks amphibians we could certainly do with more of them here they r often adorable
luci o o oh want to talk about your day i‚Äôm here for you pal
is that a white‚Äôs tree frog looks just like my old one chester after chester bennington i was really into linkin park as a teenager
he kind of looks more like he‚Äôs waiting for you to explain your reasoning behind something he deeply disapproves of
looks like he s waiting for you to own up to something bad that you ve done
i can never trust these posts after seeing those fake ones with the posed dead animals
he looks like he truly cares about what you have to say would hire as a therapist
he s about to sing you a song about the rainbow connection
as a young kid we had a frog that lived in the plants lived about months
cute little guy or gal i wonder what kind of frog he or she is not the typical ones i see on occasion their little faces are different maybe a tree frog
you think your day was bad well when i woke up this morning i was a prince
my dudes it is not wednesday incase you were confused
can i talk to you about our lord and savior jesus christ
hears something i didn t know about frogs until my cat found one they can fucking scream
"or he has an important quest you will need to
complete before leveling up ‚¨ÜÔ∏è"
would you like to hear about a company called geico
i is wait yup still wait say listening frog no jumps for to conclusions as why you is late
have you heard about our lord and savior jesus croaks
he doesn t want to talk he is spying on you reminds me of pepe
he looks like he‚Äôs about to make you an offer you can‚Äôt refuse
so carl how have you been since our last session any hallucinations this week
somehow i imagine this frog having kelsey grammer s voice
so how deep were you in work related issues today knee deep
i would like a welcome home frog he looks so genteel
i think he looks like he wants to ask you about your insurance yes i know he s not a gecko but that face makes me think of it
he‚Äôs come to deliver your acceptance letter to frogwarts school of witchcraft and ribbitry
looks like he about to give an offer you cant refuse
in korg s voice you hear it ask if you would like to join him in a hop
cute but also somehow a symbol for alt right fascism so im gonna upvote with my right hand and then down vote with my left hand and then type this comment using only my nose aaaahhhchhooooooo
yeah that‚Äôs it that amphibian wants to hear about your day fuck who knows maybe he does
this looks like its from that artist who uses cruel methods breaking jaws tying them up with wires etc to pose animals for pictures
this sweet baby was sleeping when i spotted her now the sun is out and warming her up and she s awake just looking around no sign of momma yet but she s not standing up or crying so she s okay for now
really you re not going with a fawn on my lawn it s right there
there s a fawn on my lawn amp x b missed opportunities
its ears are curled i read that curled ears mean the deer is stressed and has possibly been abandoned i hope when he left he found his momma
fawns don t have a scent yet so predators can t sniff them out the moms keep their distance from the fawn for this reason don t try to move it because mom will come back as long as you stay away
just don‚Äôt pet it if the mom smells your scent on it she might abandon the little thing
it looks like you either got really close to it or you are using a good camera what did you take this pic with
‚Äúi‚Äôd like to take him home and just just keep him as a pet but that‚Äôs not what he‚Äôs meant to be he‚Äôs meant to be free free bob ross
what a precious little darling i‚Äôm just fawning over it
if you mow your front lawn and find a fawn you just might be a redneck
trying to look tough and everything ‚Äúyo what you looking at ‚Äù lol beautiful dog
fluffy gorgeous and regal i grew up with gsds they are smart and awesome dogs
that s actually not a dog it s a furry land shark trust me i have one of those they ll gnaw on you all day long
i was at the clinic yesterday and saw a puppy that looked almost identical to this little guy i wanted to steal him now i want to steal both getting my lab spayed spade spaid hmm i may be dumb
reminds me of a corgi german shepherd mix i saw at multnomah falls in oregon a couple years ago i wish i had taken a picture because no pups come close in a google search i still think about that pup every now and then i probably always will from this day until my last day
still can‚Äôt believe there‚Äôs a market for the scales of these little guys essentially fingernails but some cultures still consider the scales ‚Äúmedicinal‚Äù
there is a very cool jointed d printer file of these and it s the coolest fucking thing
i just want to respectfully hug him and hide him away from asshats who would take his scales
taking a random photo from the internet and posting on reddit for free karma hmmm
raise awareness about them being one of the most trafficked animals ever seriously people we have to help
sir i think you ve mistaken that there is a dinosaur
have you seen the one of the chick eating the ice cream cone
the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog and fucking kills you
i still think that guy punching that kangaroo is the best video i‚Äôve seen on social media
is there a rule about how often a clip can be reposted
you have to be new on the internet if that‚Äòs the best video you have ever seen
oh good thing you thought we‚Äôd never have seen it hint we‚Äôve seen it
best repost for the th time i‚Äôve seen on reddit period
anyone have the link to the smash version of this video
just got on the internet for the first time this morning i see
the quick brown fox jumped over snow white to kiss you
looks like probably a fox in captivity pretending to be a fox not in captivity
i wish he ate the camera and it turned black but then faded to elder scrolls
dramatic chipmunk is the best video on social media but this is really good too
more than sleeping bunny with lullaby that they frickin change the song so it s no longer the same one
amezing what a unique vedio it s really able to watch again and again
how did this video that s been reposted literally million times and now looks like it was recorded on a iphone get over k upvotes damn
you obviously haven t seen teeny tiny kitten with her toy
i let out a loud woah in my room the fox is majestic as fuck
i like how he opens his mouth before colliding with the camera ahhhhhh
it is literally impossible for a slow motion video to be the best video on the internet
i was so sure this was gonna turn into an intro to skyrim
for second i thought this was going to transition into the skyrim intro
i thought something scary was going to pop up at the end
your favorite video has captive wild animals gotta disagree
gamers nexus just did a full review and comparisons it s not much better for gaming only purposes if you already have a binned model that can overclock good
you know you have ptsd when you expect to wake up in a horse cart
random fact foxes smell like skunks and they pee on things that they love to keep so if they love you they will pee on you and you will forever smell of them don‚Äôt make foxes pets let nature stay wild
big call best you seen that guy with his head up an elephant‚Äôs ass i swear to god
put your finger in the center and receive a boop from mr fox boye
record scratch yeah that s me i bet you re wondering how i got here
subcat s a bit of a chonker there might want to ask the subcat vet about that
makes me think in the womb he absorbed his brother but still wanted the memory of his weak ass
this is one of those jungle cats that have the imprint to make it look smaller and less likely a predator would want to eat him
it‚Äôs crazy because i have the same cat the same age
what kitty is evolving your kitty evolved into a catto
i used to have a mother daughter pair that looked just like those two
should ve done this earlier but i was at work heres my lil girl cat kiyoko or kiyo for short i got her not long after i was diagnosed with anxiety and depression shes been like a lifeline for me
looks a lot like my hell cat who would fight every other male cat and just fuck all the time idk why he was like that but we couldn‚Äôt keep him inside or fixed because he was viscous but he‚Äôs still a good cat rip pikabu
what beautiful eyes that s one good looking cat lucky you
oh my look at those little white paws i too have a tuxedo with little white paws we adopted him when he was so we missed the kitten phase i love seeing how he may have looked and your kitty grew up to be such a gorgeous and handsome cat so adorable and sweet thank you for sharing
first photo looks like the cat has forrest whitaker eye
tuxedo cats are awesome dressed in their best with nowhere to go
i hope you didn‚Äôt adopt her at weeks or at least she stayed with her litter that‚Äôs way to young to adopt a kitten weeks minimum preferably otherwise they likely will have behavioral issues since they were never properly socialized
those eyes sure grew up but they are still a kitten to me beautiful
spider cat spider cat look at that spider cat watch him climb up his cage by gravity he is not phased look out here comes the spider cat
despite all his rage he is still just a cat in a cage
i love this this is exactly how i met my kitten nigel who lived to be i brought a cat into a vet who had been hit on the highway kitty lived when i went back two days later to check on the injured cat nigel was hanging upside down in the cage just like this there was no doubt he was coming home with me
i would take that cat home no doubt just bacause its hanging upside down
"spider cat spider cat
does whatever a spider cat does
can he swing from a web no he can t
he s a cat
look out
it s spider cat"
spider cat defies gravity and melts hearts all at once ‚ù§Ô∏è
whoever lets that cat out of the cage is in for a real treat of fur cuteness and complete terror
best version of spiderman out of them all in all of the spider verse definitely the cutest when testing his newly acquired powers as this picture shows
yes hi hello is this customer support yes i think that my cat is broken what should i do
bucks says the cat fell and hit the corner of his kitty litter box and spilled it everywhere
i mean they have a spider pig so this doesn t surprise me
spider cat spider cat does whatever a spider cat does
i upvoted but why is the cat in a kennel i m hoping it s at a store for adoption or something
i don t think she appreciates the gravity of the situation
i swear i thought about this cat today remembered seeing this picture a while back and was so sure i saved it thanks to whoever postedüòÅ
‚Äúyou don‚Äôt own me‚Äù plays as cat sips coffee from an espresso machine
finally my friends at long last the day has come we have the means the understanding the technology to allow spiders to talk with cats
almost got me there the picture is just upside down
here we go again to anybody asking why the kitten is in a cage from my experience it s very common for rescue kittens to be caged though when they re in their foster homes especially if there s other pets in the household the most important reason being that there s usually little in the way of medical records for rescues so they might be carrying diseases or infections that can t be diagnosed until symptoms show up in which case you don t want them anywhere near your other pets until you know another reason is because of other pets even other cats if they ve never been around kittens before they can freak out and sometimes act aggressive in which case it s best to wait until they get used to the smell of the kitten around the house or wait until the little one is big enough that a bit of roughhousing won t hurt it final reason kittens are small like small if you ve got a lot of nooks and crannies in your house where a kitten can get stuck then you want somewhere safe for them to doze and entertain themselves for a while when you can t pay full attention to them otherwise you re going to be spending the next few hours trying to find them again my so s mother rescues and fosters cats herself so i see this quite a lot
did he just plonk down when he was done or to be an up right spider cat
in a meow meow burst i m back to save the multiverse
heh funny in the original the bike was going the other way
look at that good boi pedalling the bike all by himself
i wonder if he things he is the fastest dog alive no one tell him
anybody know what brand this carrier is i m looking for something similar for my dog
lousy good for nothing human strapped to my back sitting around while i do all the work
the back to the future theme was playing in my head for this
i wonder what makes him go into doggy paddle mode looks like they are riding on a pier of some sort that has water on both sides being high up and in a suspended weightless attitude i ll move along
this is one of the cutest things i have seen in a while lol
i hate to be that guy but is this safe the dog is adorable and all but could he get hurt really easily in that position
what a cutie i had a lab that used to absolutely love going to the vet for her it was just a place to make friends and get a lot of love and petting
going to the vet is never a problem it s going back to the vet that s the issue
narrator and that was before the rectal thermometer
"aww he‚Äôs cute our dog loves the vet always has she loves meeting new people and thinks the oral
medication is a treat sadly she doesn‚Äôt behave well with other dogs so we usually have to go later in the evening when most others are at home eating supper"
they re not afraid of the vet the first time they go
you tell that vet if he hurts a piece of fur on that ball of adorable cuteness i will find him
you ve been visited by health doggo upvote this post to be healthy your entire life
they are always brave the first visit it s downhill from there
i have a picture of my lab where he has the same smile goin on
my lab was happy the first visit but every visit afterwards it was like i was plowing a field in the parking lot the way i had to drag him in
my pup was so happy too but after the first jab she hesitated then went off like an air raid siren poor little thing
try not to project your fears on the little fellow huh
there haven‚Äôt been any visitors to this island there‚Äôs no reason for him to fear man
they re always brave for the first vet visit because they don t know they re going to the vet
hello two questions is that a golden retriever or what is it called i don t know a lot about dogs but i love them how would you convince your parents to buy you a dog i know you might have bought your own but i m with foreign parents what should i say what should i do
it s such a tiny little murder claw ball of fluff bouncing around i love it
thanks for letting us see its face in the end the experience wouldn t have been complete otherwise
you ever see something so cute that you just want to stab yourself
i can‚Äôt say nothing i need to say hi to that kitty irl
i love that it‚Äôs toy is a pacifier and it looks ready to kill to defend it
that kitten runs like it was designed by a disney animator
haha the little swipes at the end üòÇ so much attitude stuffed into a little ball of fluff lol
imagine walking into this house not knowing your friend has a tiny kitten like this and see it dart from undera couch through your legs and run under another couch still cute but would definitely scare me
hey thanks i have never actually hit my cake day before üòÅ
whenever i see small kittens i have the urge to put them in my mouth am i weird
my doggie had two binkies but one was her favorite when it broke she died inside things were never the same after
i honestly don t understand how anyone can be around something as cute as this and live a normal life i can t cope with the cuteness my heart
so small so round like a little ball of mashed potatoes
don t you see its not a toy he is a fierce predator and that is his prey lt
the older brown cat in the corner just watches it go by fucks given
i love the other cat at the beginning like that kiddo run fast
i ll always upvote this gif but it s a few years old at least and i ve often wondered how well the kitten grew up wish we could see it now
i would like to commend the camera guy for following that kitten with perfect aim it s the cinematography that makes this video so excellent the kitten with the pacifier helps of course
i m so glad i was alive today to see this gif i m truly blessed
and i m officially a cat person now who wants my dog his very loving and a bit of an attention seeker
this is so cute it almost hurts me i fucking love baby kitty triangle tails
awwwwwwwwww imma show my girlfriend this she loves cat s aswell as me d
i have never needed any one thing so bad in my life this cat is it
i like how it‚Äôs legs go completely horizontal when it runs
je is running for something he has a purpose no one can stop him
possibly the cutest thing i have ever seen so cute it should have an event horizon
i figured it would be cute but i was not even close to prepared
that s quite the agility for such a tiny floof running with something
that epic stride when it gets its footing majestic little snuggle floooof
what pokemon is this totally adorable and outa f this world üòç
human reaches for pacifier kitten no you don t i keel you and curse your children for seven generations
my heart just melted üòçüòçüòç‚ù§‚ù§ little kitteen come heeere üòçüòç
i like what happens when you go to reach for the toy kitty says no take i keeeel you
why hasn t science created dog or cats that stay babies for ever
as it was running full speed i thought yes little one the world is soooooooooooo big
is the cat in the corner it‚Äôs mom or pop looking onward
it blends in so well with the floor and the walls i d walk with my eyes peeled to not hurt it
anyone notice the orange cat hiding from the little ball of fluff
in about weeks that cat is gonna be a terror i cute cuddly adorable terror but a terror nonetheless if ever there was a cat that wanted to okay can i climb this or how high can i get it s this one for sure
i will always upvote this gif its the cutest cat ever
i m s year old male but if only i could describe the noise i just made watching this little murder floof
are they bred to look like anime it is precious but wouldn t trust my less than month old kittens around it
the other cat in the background at the beginning of the gif must be saying i used to be the cute one
oh my god it s so fucking cute thank you i wanted to cry and this helped
very fierce little kitten better post some warnings on your door
everyone awwwww so cute kitten fucking die you shit hahaa how do you feel now take that
does anyone else see big kitty quietly observing by the door üò∫
i have seen this so many times and it makes me squeal of happiness and cuteness every time
good lord that is a cute kitten what kind of cat is it its like a disney comic come to life
this kitten is the only thing i want in life now nothing else matters
i need this naughty little kitty in my life bad kitties are the best
the friggin toy is bigger than the fluffball dies because of an overdose of cuteness
it s moving with so much hustle and purpose like it knows exactly what it s doing and where it s going
i ve seen this gif a million times and never noticed there was another cat in the background in the beginning
this reminds me of when my cat had kittens we had a little white one like this that was the runt of the litter he would come when you called his name and his back legs would come up so high they‚Äôd kick his lil ears
excuse me stop right there it is illegal to post something this cute
this little fluff ball definitely just stole a baby‚Äôs pacifier and is running for cover üòÇ
actually fairly ‚Äúwith it‚Äù for a kitten they are usually very loopy until they look more adolescent
this makes me really wish i had one as a pet but they aren t tameable sadly
it‚Äôs because people think we want to see their cats
trust me bro i think everyone here is very glad they re aren t any wolf pics here cough cough furries cough
i am also displeased about the amount of small wolf pics in this subreddit
could be a coyote or wolf coyote they increasingly are interbreeding especially in the american north east
same wolves are my fave animal and my spirit animal wolves are just so misunderstood
maybe lots of redditor did attempt to take photo of them with intention to post here but they just didnt make it back alive
i think isle royale is probably my favorite place on earth bummed about the last group but excited about the next
we tremble at your displeasure please oh please post wolf pics
this is the new way to get any animal to the front page is it
this is the law of the jungle as old and as true as the sky the wolf that keeps it may prosper but the wolf that breaks it will die like the creeper that girdles the tree trunk the law runneth other and back for the strength of the pack is the wolf and the strength of the wolf is the pack
maybe because people typically post pictures of their pets and most people do not have pet wolves supply constrained
i‚Äôm displeased with redditors unable to come up with cleaver original titles
i m displeased about the small amount of wolves left on the planet tbh
let me take a photo of my pet wolf and post oh wait that‚Äôs right it‚Äôs illegal and dangerous most likely why they‚Äôre rare photos
small amount of wolf pics or amount of small wolf pics
y all better start posting more wolf pics or i swear i ll throw a damned emp and destoy every phone out there s
well there was a gif of that wolf licking the girl s mouth
i m displeased that this title is constantly used over and over for wild animals of course there is a small amount most wolves are in the wild not the backyard makes no sense to say you are displeased that people who mostly not only post pictures of their house pets don t post pictures of wild animals i know some people have exotic animals and that s cool but the majority of us do not have wolves elephants and giraffes just to name a few that people have said they are displeased to not see enough of
maybe someone can post an alt animal without the prerequisite note of being displeased
there are a lot of people that are unhappy about the lack of certain animals on this subreddit
post format for this subreddit i‚Äôm disappointed in the lack of insert literally any animal other than cats or dogs pictures on this page
my corgi i was named sadie too i miss her so much she was such a great dog i remember when i was little she would let me lay on her like a pillow while she d watch over me
what a wise and happy pup it reminds me of a smiling buddha statue
such a good girl i hope my corgi boy is still around and smiling when he s
did anyone else notice how both dogs have the same coloured patches on their head amp neck
i took my dog into the pet food store and he spent half the time barking at that dog poster funniest thing i‚Äôve ever seen
not just trying that pretty face is upstaging the model what a beautiful smile
what do you mean trying they are obviously much better than the model
when you have a body that fits your ears compared to mr elephant
wow what an amazingly long life she‚Äôs had you‚Äôre lucky to have spent so long together ‚ô•Ô∏è
i lost my girl in november i miss her every day good healing to you friend
beautiful kitty she was obviously well loved to live such a long life she was happy with you
i seriously hate how much this has been meme d but rip it s so hard losing a pet
i am sorry about your loss but years is so wonderfully long i hope you have plenty of memories to turn to rip sweet kitty
you had such a cute kitty ‚ù§Ô∏è so sorry for your loss i know how that feels
jesus that cat is twice as old as me that‚Äôs amazing
sorry for your loss what a fantastic age for your cat to get to lt
i think cats instinctively recoil st hands coming st them from above unless they get this kind of exposure as a kitten my favourite trick for luring cats is to point to a spot on the ground in front of me cats are smart enough to recognise that your palm being down means they won‚Äôt get grabbed
to squiff squiff your fingers together in an attempt to warn baby cat of incoming pets pleases me
no this can‚Äôt be real i can‚Äôt deal my heart is melting
how the camera is positioned and the way the hand twitches made me think it was the beginning of a howtobasic video
i thought the proper spelling on reddit was scritches üòΩ
this made me summon my kitty for scritchy scratchies and he came running right away d
you‚Äôve got yourself a perfect little theracat there
i wish i had another cat since my last cat of years ran away and probably went to die somewhere i still havent found her
he looks like my cat when he was a kitten white boots and all
i love when kittens become aware of how good scritches feel
this is a legit cat owner that tells the cat you re gonna touch it before touching it respect
if there s one thing i learned from owning a cat for years you don t pet cats they pet you
i wonder why some cats loves to be scratched on their head forhead while other cats hate it my cat loves it my boyfriend s cat hates it
if only i could get that my kitten is too skittish and runs from me
scritches for my bitches i have boy cats but nothing rhymes with scritches for boys the dilemma and terrible horrible shame of no enough wordy am die lol still scritches for my bitches
hey it s a maine coon he she looks exactly like my cat when she was a kitten
this makes me miss when my year old baby boy was a kitten üòø
so pure so soft so much love i wanna scritch em too
i can t upvote this enough looks just like my little tiger when he was tiny üòçüòç
that is my favorite thing when they squint their little eyes and lean into it ‚ô°
where do you live where there‚Äôs still snow i live in the boonies of canada and we even have nice weather
my cat does the same thing every time it snows here she charges out decides she really doesn t like snow and then slinks back in to be petted and comforted
cat mad at the owner like it‚Äôs their fault looks like he feels betrayed
that s going to earn you some revenge toe bites for sure
many japanese cats have short tails regardless if there is a kotatsu they will be in there during winter
well it wasn‚Äôt the cat‚Äôs idea maybe don‚Äôt throw it out in the snow when it doesn‚Äôt want to go out or do you mean this dumb staged post was a bad idea because that i can agree with
legit thought she was using the force to open the door
‚Äúlook into my eyes deeply i want you to see the man who finally ends you‚Äù that little doggo probably
a very cute visual representation of common anxiety
sorry about the loss of your finger hopefully they were able to at least save your hand
y o u h a v e c o n t r a c t e d s a n g u i n i s l y c a n i s
this is exactly what i need for feeling down hahah thanks
repost and i m not even mad happy to look at those little teeth once week
hey how about an nsfl tag on this absolute massacre on human hand
this crazy old but still cute google savage dog and you ll see it
if you think this is cute you‚Äôd also find a flying fox cute
i like these pet influencers whose first instinct after being bitten by a dog is to take a picture of it
this is cute as hell but i‚Äôll be the buzzkill and say if you do this often he‚Äôll grow up thinking that when people put their hands near him he‚Äôs to bite
ferocious beast rips off undefendable human s finger
dammit i warned you steve now you re gonna get it chomp
i will say that has to be the cutest nom i have ever seen
i know it s not good to encourage a puppy to nip or bite but look at those little teefs
ohhh dogs are such vicious creatures i hope you survived
dis day so fun hope never en i wiggle tail an cronch da fren
every time i see this adorable repost i wonder lab puppy
viscous attack by wild dog you won t believe what happened next
i hope his name is beast and lives in a way too large dog house
wait last time i saw this puppy he was swimming in a pool of lava and had a human skull in his mouth good luck fam
so everybody is going to ignore the fact that this pupper now has taste of man flesh run for the hills
ah this bug happens sometimes basically because the entity is suspended off the ground it thinks it s in a fluid so it switches from the land walking animation to the swimming animation we ll be sure have this fixed in the upcoming patch thanks for giving us the heads up
i ve seen this post so many times sometimes they say the dogs are boys sometimes they say the dogs girl i swear i saw this posted like a day or two ago and the dog s name is luna in that post
just need a green screen and you can have a dog chasing cookies with a background of a field d
if i came out to my car and found this it would be the greatest day of my life
i always post on threads like this if you regularly park your vehicle outside and have every found animals lounging on it please give the hood a thump before you ever start it up you ll hate yourself if you have to deal with the aftermath of a critter who thought your engine bay was a comfy place to seek refuge
lol the one on the right just gonna bury my face here
i thought this was a bunch of rocks in water from the thumbnail this is definitely better
the one in the middle is even posing for the camera
all the other cars in the neighborhood are electric
how much hp can a cat produce aren t horses like hp
it s gonna be hard going to work if i have to wake up this bunch of fur balls
a lot nicer to have on your windshield than bird shit
i had a grey calico who loved nothing more than sleeping on a black car in direct sunlight on f days she d come inside with fur literally too warm to touch comfortably empty her water bowl and then slosh back outside to continue her nap this was the same cat who would sleep inside the fireplace with a fire going if we let her get away with it and would press on the fire screen enough that she had to be extinguished more than once when embers drifted a bit she was a sweet loving kitty but a bit touched in the head we suspected it was because her heat loving habits had cooked her brain just a wee bit
and scratched paint is cool cats totally respect the neighbors cars
i need to convince the neighborhood cats to do this maybe then the stupid squirrels would quit trying to store their nuts under my truck s battery
this car purrs like the engine was a v made out of kittens
my worst fear i‚Äôm so genuinely happy you were able to reunite with your family member
i don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs going to let you even leave the room and why would you want to so happy for you
glad he made it back to his family he‚Äôs a very pretty dog and i wouldn‚Äôt have put it past someone to snatch him up without reporting him found
i m so glad you were reunited this reminded me to hug my pup a little tighter
awww you missed each other so much you made the same noises when you saw each other
i can literally feel the relief and love in this video i don t know what i d do if my pup ran away i m so happy he s back and being a good boy
i m so happy jasper and you got reunited it s exactly as i would have hoped and love how you grasp his leash my corgi luckily ins t bothere by either we ve exposed her to them both such a happy reunion
i had a blue merle aussie who escaped once a year for about a week no matter what we did the same time every year he‚Äôd escape and come back days later even once he aged and he was blind and deaf not in any pain same routine he always found his way back to me and i‚Äôm glad yours did too
so glad for the happy ending i cringe to think what would happen if my dog ever disappeared
"he looks just like my aussie so happy
you found him i can‚Äôt imagine‚ù§Ô∏è"
i am so glad you found him i know this isn t the same type of situation but it just reminded me of how my old dog who is living with my ex reacted after i saw her for the first time in two months she was so happy to see me and it was so hard to say goodbye knowing i will probably never see her again i really miss her
i am so happy you found him you can see the love and happiness flowing both ways investing in a gps tracker on his collar would be a great solution should this happen again
as the owner of a fellow wiggle butt this warms my cold heart
how annoying keeps trying to mess up ur face glasses hair
now you know keep your dogs inside if they get startled easily theres a lot of horror stories where im at a lot of fireworks going off dogs freaking out and climbing over fences stabbing themselves panicking on the street getting hit by cars ect i always see at least dead dogs on the street on my commute to work into rowdy neighborhoods luckily i have a foot wall around my yard and my dogs arn t scared of loud noises my issue is random used fireworks landing in my yard and them investigating
our last aussie would generally stay at my side at all times our new aussie who is about months does not seem to have the same connection and has run twice once when her collar came off and once when the leash broke we were able to keep her in our sight both times and eventually get her with some help it will be interesting now that summer is here as we and by we i mean my parents have a cottage on a lake we always let our last aussie run free as she did not wander from us and liked to fetch toys from the lake i am not sur whether our new aussie will like swimming as much or even get the chance to try it
i m so happy that you found him that s so heartwarming to see
when i turned on the sound my aussie woke and started freaking out thinking either i was crying or hearing your dog crying so glad you guys found each other
yeah we re lucky jasper stays close to us all the time expect when there s unexpected thunderstorm aussie are awesome
oh my goodness i‚Äôm so glad you found him ‚ù§Ô∏è it‚Äôs so scary when they run off üò•
you know its cute and all but i hate people filming that shit and posting it on the internet
uggggh fireworks we love them our fur children hate them so glad you were reunited with this cute little one
good for you both he looks so relieved and happy to see you
i once lost my jagdterrier puppy yo for four whole days when i was hiking his breed is disappointingly fast like he frequently beats my fucking weimaraner in over short distances i went back to the trail every day for at least hours a day found him on the fourth day or i should say he found us he had clearly been eating fine he made friends with two coyotes he was leading them wtf they would roll over and whine at him dude it was insane clearly they had eaten something out there cuz he wasn‚Äôt hungry until the next day i‚Äôve never been so sad happy angry all at once lol needless to say i spent months and months training the ‚Äúinvisible leash‚Äù with him after that
i lost my dog for a week once turned out she was with my neighbor only minutes away
nancy how could you do you know how many squirrels i had to trap and kill and how many cats i had to bark at and scare off and you did this to me nancy it s all your fault
omg my heart can‚Äôt handle this i‚Äôm so glad you found him he‚Äôs a beautiful pup
i think this made a lot of people happy myself included i‚Äôm so happy for you
i know this joy i mean after all the fear involved happy you found your wiggle butt
this made me cryyyy i love my dog with all my heart
i m so glad he is ok and back home with you i am familiar with the panic and know how upsetting it is
good for u guys i couldn‚Äôt imagine losing my dog lt
this is amazing i‚Äôm actually tearing up thank you for sharing this moment with us ‚ù§Ô∏è
oh man i ve been through that so many times great clip
i am soooooo happy for you guys this is a feeling that is unmatched i‚Äôm so glad you were reunited
cow finds her friend dog after almost a whole day searching this would be a better title in my opinion
im so glad you guys found him holy shit i can‚Äôt imagine what you went through those hours saw much raw emotion in this video it‚Äôs bringing tears to my eyes
good to hear if that dog had a tail i d swear you swiped my kiddos dog such a good lookin assuming mini aussie
lost my dog years ago he has always been a old man dog when we found him hours later a family caught him and kept him he pretended not to know us we had to prove to the family he was ours because he did not act like this lol
hours i would not have stopped thinking about him for a millisecond must have been rough it s the reason i hate being at work more than anything else just the paranoid thoughts about something happening to my beloved dog
wait you only walked km in hours don t you mean km i don t understand
a cry like that is that kind of cry that happens when you thought whoever you were looking for was gone forever i m so glad you found him
this is a bad time to be pregnant damn you hormones
i can‚Äôt even imagine how scared you were i‚Äôm so so so happy for everyone that you found your pupper
well she didnt walk the km in less than hours so this checks out
hahahahaha the sound at the begining of this shit was hysterical
dang it now i have to hide in my office until the happy tears go away
wow you had to be very stressful i am happy you found your dog üòäüòä
i feel your love and relief from the other side of the world i can t imagine not knowing where he was
i know this feeling mime got let out by a maintenance guy in a busy part of boston still thankful and nutty about access toy house by strangers
i have to turn this off now i m sitting at my desk tearing up congratulations and give him a big hug from me
i m so glad you found him relatively quickly having had a pet go missing i know what kind of hell you went through and how happy you likely are to have him back just out of curiosity does he have a microchip cause if not you might wanna have that done pretty cheap and it s worth the price if only for the peace of mind it provides
so happy you found your baby but i also really wanted to tell you that your leggings are awesome
i‚Äôm actually crying that was beautiful honestly i wish you all the best
have myself gone through that horrifying feeling and was lucky found our within a few hours so glad you found your doggy
you are both so clearly overwhelmingly happy to see each other again that it melts my heart so glad you found him losing a dog is a scary experience
just goes to show if your dog is lost you don t look for an hour then call it quits you get out there and find that fucking dog
it s always a wonderful moment when a woman and her boyfriend are finally reacquainted
finally do you know how much the gods have waited dog you shall bring the rains after we eat you muahaha you can t run away anymore
i have a chocolate lab that made it km from home and was gone for days idk how she made it that many nights but i‚Äôm glad she did i‚Äôm also glad you two were reunited
those dogs need tons of space and exercise daily being an obese person myself i m sure she is not able to meet the standards that breed needs
i m so glad for you make sure to keep this good boy safe
my aussie used to wander a lot when she was a pup never trying to run away just sneaking out to explore she would always come back hours later or we would end up finding her a few blocks away i was always super upset that she would do this and tried everything we could to stop her from getting out but she kept finding a way one day when i was out looking for her i found her and she was so excited to see me she came running over to see me on her way over she got smacked by a truck on the highway the truck was able to slow down a little bit at the last second but still hit her hard enough to tear her up pretty bad she had an in gash on her right side that was so deep i could see her rib cage i was so scared she was dying i immediately scooped her up and ran home to my car where i drove so fast and so illegally to the closest vet er they said they couldn‚Äôt operate on her until until she started to come out of shock which would likely be the next morning they bandaged her up a little bit and told us all we could do was wait to see if she made it through the night the next morning they were able to operate on her and cleaned up the gash needing dozens of sutures and lots of staples they also performed a fho if i remember correctly where they removed her femur head the joint that rotates in her hip because there was a torn ligament that wouldn‚Äôt heal on its own hours and later she hobbled out of the icu in her little doggy wheel chair it took her a long time to be able to walk normally again but that never stopped her from being the happiest little sweetheart ever she never wanders off anymore and has made a full recovery we take her on hikes and backpacking trips regularly and she couldn‚Äôt be happier tldr look out for the ones you love
dog s like don t leave me again and humans be like don t leave again
it took you hours to travel km what did you do roll
awesome you found your best friend although hours is not finally üòÇ that s f ing quick doesn t take away from the good feeling finding him though d
went through something similar feel for you so happy you found him
yay glad he is home safe my boofer runs off at every chance he was out back today because the landlord was coming by summer decided it was too damned hot out so he slipped his collar jumped the fence and ran away to the front door
in barbaric early roman times these people would have been in serious danger just walking around on human built roads hugging dogs and crying amp x b amp x b amp x b amp x b just sayin amp x b amp x b amp x b amp x b amp x b amp x b amp x b amp x b amp x b amp x b amp x b amp x b still heartwarming though i m glad he was found
what happened did he lose his glasses dogs are amazing aren‚Äôt they
maybe it s a mini ausie thing cause mine has been known to run off and get picked up miles from home happened twice at a house we used to live at took us a bit to figure out that she was climbing the fence to get out
would you please stop cutting onions right next to me
i once leave the garage door open and by the time i noticed my dog was just gone i spent the next week waking and driving around all the neighborhood giving flyers and i even printed some huge images of my dog for people to help out it was the most devastating thing because you start loosing hope and after one week someone called that they have found him once we were reunited we both started crying and the next couple of days my dog just followed me everywhere not wanting to leave my side what a scary thing it is to lose your friend
australian shepherds and border collies are insane you‚Äôre lucky it was km later knowing them they‚Äôd even probably still be running
yay i m so glad for you what a sick feeling to lose a dog
see this is the reaction i expect when being reunited with a missing pet i teared up a soon as i heard her crying i d be unconsolable if i couldn t find my dog outdoors
my dog running away is one of my worst nightmares the not knowing of whether he s dead on the streets living with some other family absolutely terrifying i can t think of a more euphoric and relieving moment than a reunion like this
aww both you and the dog are making such sweet sad sounds loved seeing how happy you both are to be back together
this reminds me of the time in college when we were walking our dog through the woods and she ran ahead of us a giant swarm of bats started going nuts in the trees above us and we had to call for her for a decent bit when she finally heard us you could hear her bolting through the brush so fast and i ve never seen a happier more relieved dog in my life
i thought you were pumpkin from mama june for a second
if our dogs met they would almost not be discernable your dog acts and looks just like my aussie i m glad you found your little lick machine because that s what ours is lol
oh my god this makes me bawl like a baby but at the same time i can t stop smiling those genuine emotions from both the dog and his mom are just pure comfort food for the soul what a fantastic bond we share with them i m so happy for you all
so happy to see this i saw posts on facebook for jasper and i m glad you got him back
i have the same pants sweetlegs are so comfy glad pup is home safe üíú
did yall dock his tail or did you get him that way follow up breeder or rescue
i m so glad i know my heart drops when i call for my dog out back and it takes more than seconds for them to acknowledge me so i can t imagine how worried you were i m glad jasper is back with someone who loves him so much
i m so glad you got your boy back idk what i d do if my cat thomas ran away he s my best friend and i m his and we re always together i can t even imagine the relief you must feel
gets me right the feels and i m dead inside glad your found him
fuck yes this is the good shit omg also my blu baby looks a lot like him and i miss him so much and cant wait to see him again to get hugs like that üò≠üñ§üôèüèº
i love this so much i wish i had this rambunctious little gremlin in my life
the first photo looks like he is defending his treasured fruit circle and the second two look like he has been betrayed by his trusted companion and is plotting a painful but deserved revenge
first pic he s angry and cute second he s raging and he s cute third he is disappointed and cute
from jim hensons workshop the watermelon and the grumpy grufflepug
grumpy cat passes away to be reborn as a cat again i can see why shes furious
i make those faces when my boss brings me something i need to re write after he ignored my ideas and what he tells me to write are my own ideas
i am the lord of watermelon you do not fcuk with me
nobody gets in to see the wizard not nobody not no how
cat this is my motherfriggin watermelon get your own
chucky the doll possessed a cat and a love for watermelons interesting
can‚Äôt wait to see what he looks like when he grows up
looks like someone is trying out their new animatronics cute
i ve been on reddit too long when people think memes from over years ago are new
this is why you don t plant your melon patch next to a pet sematary
its so angry but so cute i just wanna fsghdkfhdjdjb sgkshdgsjxd
poor cat looks like it was buried in the pet sematary
i hate this urgh why am i here oh wait camera hi this is great
the kitten reminds me very much of a muppet for some reason
whaddaya mean you watered the melons it won t be sweet ya doofus
thats not a cat thats a garden goblin watching the harvest defending it from those who dare to even think they will get it prized melons
she plans on taking over the world with nothing but that watermelon
in the second pic he looks like that stiff puppet pet from jabba‚Äôs lair
that cat looks like the antagonist in a new jim henson movie
would ominously pet while in a dark room sitting in a swivel chair
i think we have found our new replacement for angry cat who recently passed away
that is his watermelon and he will guard it with his life
i dont know what that watermelon did to that kitten but it s in for a world of hurt from the looks of it
did tardar sauce aka grumpy cat and colonel meow have a kitten rip to two of the best internet cats that were in the game
synchronization isn t too bad if he only he didn t confuse right and left üòÖ
dude hahahaha my puppy will bop the object coming at him amp completely miss the mark to bite down
foood food food yes yes open up my mouth oh damn its a carrot not meat bail bail
my sis‚Äô dog was a talent for catching things green peas good we were sure she was a italian greyhound mutt loved to run and could do it all day since her i‚Äôm always surprised to see dogs struggle with catching things cute tho
this is pee wee baseball levels of jowls eye coordination
reminds me of the bears of bern switzerland they were so well fed lazy they would only eat what was thrown right into their mouth
see this is what happens when you get your pets vaccinated and they go all autistic on you
the lick at the beginning was to test the wind direction pretty sure he lost it in the sun though carrots sort of blend into sunlight
hahaha i had a rott who used to catch peanuts tossed in the air hardly ever missed thought this was the same but it turned out to be better
lololol i was thinking i ve never seen a dog eat a carrot before a few seconds later and i guess today is not that day either d
i showed this to my entire family and every single one of them cracked up laughing
waffles seemed to have this happened a lot seen this several times already
how is that possible does a cat s foot even have that much loose skin
in college i had a cat that tried to swat a bee his foot swole up in the same way it didn t appear to bother him though
cut the bs this isn‚Äôt your cat go to google and type in cat stung by bee it‚Äôs literally on the first page
i fisted them hard he man but i could not fist them all
i hope waffles decides to use his new found power for good
this happens to my cat about once a year it looks hilarious and like it should be painful but he never seems bothered by it he lets me touch it and walks on it like it s totally normal i ve never seen the incident that triggers it but i assume he has it out with a yellow jacket it s impossible to see your cat walking around with a giant cartoon paw and not crack up
that cat is tucked into that warm underbelly and needs to see how bad it will get before abandoning it
mass hysteria is this the end of the world üòú ghostbusters was such an awesome movie
gif ended too soon to see if the cat was down i saw some classic tailwhips as the golden settled in
cat wait a minute what are you do yeah i‚Äôm okay with it
the most comfortable pillow you ll ever own made of real live cat
i love these three people i watched other videos of them and always wonder how the cat has the patience to endure all the dragging around by the harness that the dogs do
everyone here is awwwing over this while i m thinking about the poor kitty getting squeezed the soul out of by a huge dog
all these furballs are soo chill my cat would have initiated a mini apocalypse with the dogs bringing in world war
looks more like the dog wanted to hug the cat than use it as a pillow such a cute snuggly bunch
i can perfectly imagine a russian saying that in a csgo lobby
look though how the doggo controls his body weight and how carefully lowers his chest ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
i like how he closes his eyes a little bit as he s coming into the snuggle knowing full well he might get bopped a few times for pullin this stunt so close to the puss
careful goldie million hit super speed combo might hit your puuurfect face
i dunno why but upon seeing the title my first thought was an ostrich at least i picked a bird lol
upon viewing this picture i understand your disappointment
this cutie must be the sealiest thing i have ever seen
it s cute but can we please stop with the whole lack of x is disappointing bs on this sub we get it you like a thing cool cool go ahead and post it but don t use the same title every other non dog or cat post uses please
i am disappointed by the recent lack of diversity in title choice
search for water dog water pup snow pup snow puppy you will see that they are there use google not the reddit search
maybe because most people don t own seals or see them in their day to day life ps some things are better when they are rare
this dundee goes to u epicpersondude for most reposted seal let s all give him a big hand
this is the sixth seal picture i ve seen end up in the front page this week with almost the exact same title there are plenty of seal pictures
because as much as i hate to say it the internet has screwed up my head with anything cute baby seals are cute as f ck but then you look at google ect and see things and how sick people are i love the internet just not what it s done to my brain
frontpage guarantee reposted picture same dogshit title
i bought a seal pup on a whim once and the pet store didn t let me return it but i m glad i didn t cause the pup made me very happy and now i have a seal for life
hewwo miss i‚Äôm sowwy there has been a recent lack of us but i can assuwe you we‚Äôll appear here more often
i agree we should create a subreddit for cute seals and call it club seal or seal club wait
wow i all of a sudden have the overwhelming notion to go clubbing and dance
as a qu√©becois i m not especially fond of them especially since they are in an overpopulation situation culling would be needed at that point and each time a hunt is going on europeans always try to tell us that we shouldn t and that were monsters for killing the pups when killing the pups is forbidden to begin with
there are a lot of people that are unhappy about the lack of certain animals on this subreddit
can we stop with the ‚Äúi‚Äôm disturbed by lack of ‚Äù posts
looks like brienne of sloth rising after being knighted
they look like the scientist alien from bill and ted s bogus journey station
nothing aww about this they are in cages disgusting
reminds me of the scene where harry potter has to dive down and save people chained up goblet of fire i believe
upvoting for truthy comparison without checking type
to the sloths they re rightside up they gotta move slowly because climbing a tree is like scuba diving to them
if you didn‚Äôt have a bus driver or lunch lady with nails like that growing up did you really even go to public school
maybe heard the word fishfood and thought you had said fish food instead
i feel bad seeing tortoises because when i was a kid i put one in a pond because i didn t know the difference between turtles and tortoises it sank faster than anything i ve seen before and never came back up
awww i have two tortoises and they‚Äôre as cute dis boi
what the difference between tortoise and turtle asking for a friend
what breed is your tortoise my friend i m researching about getting one myself
it feels like i m going through perpetual ground hog day in this sub it s a constant stream of people sending videos and pics with the exact same quote along the lines of there isn t enough of this or if you wanted some more of this rare oddity of an animal and it makes me feel like i m trapped in a centrifuge with steve irwin and coyote peterson and all i can listen to is the sound of coyote screaming in pain as he gets stung by a bullet ant and steve irwin flopping around dead on the ground with a jelly fish floating somewhere around nearby and as i feel like i m about to pass out and the nightmare finally ends all i hear is hey you you re awake and then it fucking starts all over again except this time i ve got a raging hard on because of the thought of being able to be a simple being under the all knowing reign of todd howard and i would love every single moment of it as he sent me a copy of fallout and every time i ran it it just booted back to skyrim and then i d play through the entire game and i d rate it ten out of ten because i m a generally forgiving person and i know that it s common occurrence for people to accidentally ship the entirety of skyrim instead of their actual game end rant
a tortoise brutally attacking an innocent vegitable
it s all fun until you try to lay on your dog then they wanna move to another room smh
this is what my corgi does they are genetically the worst cuddlers of any doggo
my dog does this too only when he does it he is saying get out of bed i need something right now i will continue to crawl all over you and lay directly on your face until you get up also he is lbs and doesn t understand that him being on top of you makes it essentially impossible to get up
i want a corgi so bad üò≠ they are the cutest little things and their butts are freakin adorable
i would give that little floof any veggies it wanted
is this what the easter bunny doing the rest of the year
those adorable bundles of mischief ate every single one of my herbs in my garden years ago and i‚Äôm still salty üò§

here comes peter cottontail üêá on the way to steal your vegetables ü•ï
bump dee dump dee dumple dee dump idk why but that tune comes into my head when i see this picture
boy and he did this year he ate my eggplants and peppers he left the tomatoes i guess those are toxic to rabbits
that‚Äôs a funny thing i remember i was on a road trip and passing through the south i‚Äôd see a bunch of farms up that said rabbits per head for rabbit hunters you could make bank off of the farmers in deep south
story time my grandfather had an angus farm in ne alabama and i lived there for several years in between stints in the military i realized that grandma was a master gardener and i wanted to learn the art so she let me have the first row of the garden one year to plant what i wanted which was snow peas now grandpa hunted raccoons and opossums and had a highly regarded blue tick hound to hunt them with though he was a ginger and had red spots instead of blue and his name was jim i had a good stand of snow peas coming along and had never noticed any problems with rabbits in the garden and thought that jim was doing a good job keeping the critters away when he was not out on the mountain hunting on his own you could hear him way off but then one day i noticed something had been chewing on my plants and thought it was bugs doing the damage until i went inside and looked back out the window toward the garden and saw a rabbit munching snow peas while jim was lying on the ground not six feet away i ran out there and scared the rabbit away then i started cursing poor old jim for sleeping on the job grandpa walked up and defended the hound explaining that jim was not supposed to hunt rabbits that he was a blue tick and you don t want them to hunt rabbits when you are trying to hunt coons or possums his designated prey but not rabbits
now rabbits are cute and all but he comes near my garden i m cooking his ass
i don t think that i have ever seen a bunny walk only hop i love this
me and the boys bout to steal yo orange ground penis
bunnies are kinda underrated on the cuteness spectrum most people mention dogs are cats especially puppies kittens bunnies are also very cute
my mother in her childhood was put in charge of raising a bunch of rabbits for food she now insists that rabbits are all evil
gt in a lavish rabbit hole with no rabbits young dumb dust bunnies jump into traffic casually gussied up and done feeling unsung and savage punk we have come for your cabbage aesop rock corn maze

i have just finished watching peter rabbit this is freaky
makin my way downtown hoppin fast carrots passed and i m hole bound
was anyone else confused looking at the ears thinking it was some sort of malformed goose maybe i‚Äôm just tired
we ve got a wild bun that lives under the deck he likes to sit in my greenhouse and get himself trapped when i check on my plants so i ve been able to get pretty close to it we feed him leftover salad and vegetable bits to appease him like a little god and he leaves my stuff alone
what u don t see is the eagle circling this poor dude xd
i love rabbits but it‚Äôs so annoying when they eat my herbs and crops i don‚Äôt see them often but geez they‚Äôre annoying
yeap you can tell his her body language amp confidence it will definitely do it and yeap probably a bugs bunny relatives
having battled a platoon of these fuckers last season i have no remorse they fuck up every single leafy green and radish i try to grow it got to a point where i was sleeping outside vietcong style waiting for one to cross my perimeter warning rocks were not viable the rabbits simply became aware of my position and rounded the garden many a hoppy fiiend were stewed that december
hippity hoppity get if my property before you catch the glock
if you are feeding them and they are not feeding you then you have ceded your place at the top of the food chain

oh that peter it looks like he lost another jacket and shoes
these guys cleaved the top half of my raspberry plants by walking ontop of the snowbank
ok you lost your carrot do you at least know where you were when you lost your carrot over there somewhere over there
no need to steal little guy they re yours for the chance to boop a bunny nose
i came home from school a few weeks ago to find out my bunnies had escaped their cage naughty as they both are they came from the no go zone aka upstairs running down looking all guilty but who can be mad at those two fellas so i had to give em a treat and put a lock on the cage door because someone knows how to open the door idk how long they were out but no accidents upstairs so i was glad fiy the buns get to hop outside their cage everyday so its not like they dont get enough space
i used to have a rabbit problem in my garden until i got very territorial yorkies that run like the wind no more bunnies
my grandma has one living under her deck and every spring she loses it because the rabbit constantly eats the heads of her tulips before they can bloom lol it‚Äôs been a year long battle probably not the same rabbit the entire time but still lmao

these are a fucking plague in the orchards around my hometown years before you could only spot a rabbit while driving at night through desert roads now they even sunbath in broad daylight and in pairs things will change whenever they re allowed to be hunted but right now all you get are angry farmers in the local newspapers

dis rabbit would get sniped instantly if it walked around my neighbourhood like dat way
this is how sharon stone trains her dogs and her detectives
the title makes me think of blacked and it bothers me
i wanted the hooman to stop midway and see what gods do
i feel like this is another case of dogs are being shown had signals off screen especially because of how intently they seem to focus above the legs
hey it s that scene from deadpool where deadpool was growing back his legs and crossed them over when cable entered the room
not that impressive she is clearly using her hind legs whereas they are using their front legs
my favourite part is when they paws half way through
that is adorable how often does the deer come by to play
does dog know deer is not a dog better yet does deer know deer is not a dog
i was confused if either the dog is huge or the deer is small apparently the dog is huge d
a house pupper playing with a forest pupper life is good
nope those are firefighters we all knew they are awesome
i would have been there for days straight worried i d missed one
the face on mama duck hurry up we ain t got all all day
men of the hour you are the best of the best thank you
is it wrong that i just stared at his butt for the longest time while he was neck deep in the drain
my neighbor and i had to rescue baby ducks from a storm grate when both the fire department and animal rescue said it was a non emergency mama duck was so worked up that she left and brought two males as backup as she waited her babies rescue we were finally able to get them out using a pool net and they were reunited at the nearby pond totally made my day
as always firefighters do the work and cops get the credit
aww the second or two mama duck waits after she got all her ducklings back must mean something most animals don t stay put near humans freely like her lack of fear meant she was grateful
"guys i now realize that those are fire fighters
they do deserve as much credits as cops
sorry for not noticing before"
everyone always seems to just think about how destructive people always are but this is easily an example of how people do care and are genuinely good it s a shame that these get overshadowed so much we need more of this shown out in the world
maybe should teach him to open doors gently next time
i am the dog i have a chore i don t have time for heckin door my human sent me on a quest i must fulfill his thirst request am grab the drink n run like hell amp nbsp i won t tell him the ceiling fell
who has drop ceiling in their house basement excluded
to everyone that thinks they could take a police dog have you ever opened a door so hard the ceiling felt it
malinois the enthusiastic happy energizer bunny of hell
looks like that dog that was posted a while back who failed every single service dog test glad he s doing well
wait did the ceiling fall down the hell i have too many questions
belgian malionois you do not have the energy to raise one
okay so i can sit down wrong and hurt my balls how the hell do dogs and such run around with their twigs and berries just banging around all over the place without it causing any problems
imagine just sitting with ur family chilling watching some forrest gump and all of a sudden a huge ass black dog busts down ur vibranium door and proceeded to ransack your supply of necessary liquids
me am hungover going for the water on my side table
that would scare the mission out of my dog‚Äôs head so fast this one didn‚Äôt even flinch
when you haven t called your dog a good boy in days and request him to bring you a water
exactly how my year old would do it except she would probably knock a few things over in the process
"i am fast mutt
an human stuck
i get him drink
i run amok i run to house but door is shut
i knock door down
im strong as fuck"
my reaction when my crush says she‚Äôs a little thirsty
looks like the fox version of a flame atronach i love that
wait wasn‚Äôt this a top post like days ago and not from you at least give the photographer credit
th repost of this picture smh i wish they d remove karma its just annoying at this point
his fur was the colour of a starless night and his eyes like burning coals heather dale
all right this is the third post in three days can we give it a rest now
if this fella showed up on my door saying he needed help ending the world i d join him
i m going to start reposting this shit too because apparently it works
wow i have seen one that used to hang around my work with the opposite markings
how many different reposts can we get of this thing
i‚Äôm not even on here every day and i‚Äôve seen this x yesterday it was ‚Äúa fox mixbreed‚Äù or some nonsense
why do i simultaneously want to pet it and run away screaming
his eyes have all the seeming of a demon s that is dreaming
first thing those eyes reminds me of geralt of rivia from the witcher
he had me sign some weird contract at the crossroads awhile back i never went pro in lol but this fox is in a tree every night smiling at me did i win
awwww whos a good little demon from the pits of hell huh is it you yes it is arent you just a cute lil devil yes you are amp x b do you want a treat huh maybe a human ear to nibble on or some fancy feast yeah good kitty amp x b pretty much what i say to my cat already but seems more apt saying it to this cute little fella
the color of that road stripe illustrates how lazy the demonic photoshopping was
uhh okay since when id literally every living thing labelled as cute
wow this has been reposted twice in quick succession
the look my mom gives me when i forgot to do my chores
this is the single most beautiful animal i ve ever laid eyes on
when you ask santa for a dog but accidentally misspell it satan
i d take that thiccy home and keep him i d buy the whole damn ocean
bro do you know what a dolphin is cause this not a dolphin i‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs a beluga whale
op you need to buy one of those children s books that teaches you what animals look like they even have some that make the sound of the animal so you can learn what they sound like too
saved the phone that thing is toast more like whale delivers a paperweight
is that a shaqueem griffin jersey sick wish i got his jersey or wilson wagner amp x b i do have a sherman jersey le sigh
i think that s earl thomas i thought it was jon ryan at first
seahawks jersey so you know it‚Äôs going to be a soft touch and not harmful in any way lt
thanks for not saying ‚Äúboi‚Äù comments will add the inevitable ‚Äúboop‚Äù ‚Äúsnoot‚Äù and ‚Äúpuppers‚Äù
give him a cigar and a microphone and watch the hilarity ensue
i‚Äôd just have to give this handsome ladd a lot of my ice cream for a snack his smile is so fantastic cheers

i am slightly disappointed from the thumbnail i thought you dressed your otter as an ewok still cute but my expectations were not met
i love otters even after being attacked by a mother river otter for getting too close to her den on a camping trip she didn t get me cuz i ran like a bat outta hell until i could no longer hear the cutest growling snorting ever my family affectionately refers to them as long beaver ever since cuz i didn t know what it was and described it as a long beaver without a flat tail
yeah the kitten is training his hooman to get off the damned bed and give him pets and it s working my cat meows at me from the door to get out of bed walk over pick him up and bring him into the bed he could jump into bed himself but oooh nooo i have to give him a limo ride

in germany we have red squirrels we used to feed them at the cemetery they become very tame it‚Äôs relaxing too
i also got to pet a squirrel recently by giving him an acorn super friendly little guy in my apartment complex
i liked how it jumped out from camera view and it was on his foot when he panned made me giggle
wish this perv would quit touching me but i do like the food though
how cute i wish i could feed a squirrel but i‚Äôm so scared of them
if any biologists see this why didn t rodents like this evolve elongated thumbs you d think thumbs would be wide spread in evolution for mammals with dexterous function given their high utility but hey nature do what it do
over here in the states i‚Äôve never seen them eat then and there here they stick em in their cheeks you can give them a whole handful and they‚Äôll stuff themselves silly before running off
naturalizing wild animals to humans is actually super detrimental to not only the critters themselves but to entire ecosystems this squirrel is now more likely to approach humans in the future thus putting itself in dangerous situations i e roadways also the more this critter enters human habitats the less it is in its natural wild space where it is a valuable part of the ecosystem as both a primary consumer and a prey species these animals are amazing and the kindest thing we can do to them is keep a respectable distance and let them remain wild
here in the states they carry hanta virus and the plague be careful
you can t touch this you can t touch this you can t touch this oh oh oh oh oh oh oh you can t touch this oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
he s like quit touchin me i just want the nuts dude this is such a magical moment tho
i went to the park with a bag of twix to feed them to the squirrels i finally got a squirrel to take one from me on video
i remember moving to a place surrounded by forest when i was a kid when we first moved in my now deceased father entertained himself hand feeding the squirrels for a bit he stopped abruptly after one got hasty and bit his finger after that we only left peanuts out for them on the porch rail
it s all fun and games untill you don t have food anymore then they turn on you
i did that as a kid with this squirrel in the backyard and kinda whispered in to my mom she comes up to the door and tells me not to pet it it could be rabid year old me keeps petting lil buddha we had red squirrels growing up these gray squirrels ain t shit
you can do this at like any public park ive had squirrels steal shit out of my kids hands
if that guy knew what rabies really is he probably wouldn t be doing that
great post made me happy reminded me of when i had a wild crow eat from my hand thanks for sharing
i see those bite marks don t try to go tricking us that he is all innocent
i wonder how weird animals feel about us petting them sometimes my dog gives me such a look when i pet him lol do they relate to their own actions and think i‚Äôm cleaning them or does the animal know i‚Äôm just randomly stroking it because it‚Äôs soft lmao
i think in nj we only natively have greys except for one place princeton rumor has it someone brought a black from canada and then they multiplied but please correct me if i m wrong
sadly we have humans that feel the need to tap the head of a stranger they just met give the squirrel some goddamn respect and stop touching him when he s eating how would you feel if a curse words starts patting your head when you re having lunch i say we train them to collect cans in return for nuts create a squirrel king that starts dealing in cans and nuts that will overthrow governments by
i once tried to feed a giant chonker of a squirrel in central park once i held a peanut in between my fingers while this massive squirrel approached me jumped up to get the peanut and chomped down hard on my fingers now i can‚Äôt help but feel a tinge if fear whenever i see squirrels around campus that ungrateful scrub
i love how it just goes on his shoes the second he looks at him
think about how weird it would be if you were in a restaurant and after the waiter brings you your food he begins petting you gently on the head as you eat at first it s weird like ok i don t really feel comfortable with that you shake your head hoping he stops then as you continue eating he begins rubbing your back it s slightly disturbing but man this burrito is good you shift in your seat a little bit but not as far away this time because of the noms i could keep going but suddenly i felt so weird about this situation but on the other hand cute video
i miss chester chester was the squirrel my roommate and i raised from a little pink nugget he was a grey squirrel but other than that he behaved almost exactly like this one the constant nibbling the twitchiness and it s exactly as fun as it sounds to have a squirrel in your life until the biting started i am now convinced that if squirrels really wanted to they could take over the world he nearly bit through my fingernail once we got rid of him shortly thereafter
i bet this guy is not even a vegan so he couldn t actually care about this squirrel in any way that matters disgusting
i raised a red squirrel and they re crazy little butt loads of energy balls
so many people watched this whole video and didnt realize they are looking at a totally red squirrel with a white belly
keep going back something like that takes time with a wild animal it s very close though
i had a brown squirrel for a little while and dude since it was wild it was super energetic and destructive to the house miss you tho stormy

do you want plague because that s how you get plague
if you want to feed a animal like this get a squirrel feeder you can hang up near a tree and get as much of the human equation out of the picture as possible and enjoy the animals from a window or a distance most of these animals have teeth that can bite through tough nuts can claws that can easily grip trees you really don t want that stuff near you as they are wild animals
dude looks like the love child of sam rockwell and nick swardson

alot of the squirrels at the memorial park in washington dc are like this saw a large crowd of people i can only assume where visiting from asia and went over to see what they were looking at they were hand feeding squirrels and loving it then it dawned on me that they don t have squirrels in asia so it was a big deal i guess the same would apply to me being over enthusiastic about a koala or kangaroo
that s a cool looking squirrel i love his ears we stopped by niagra falls back in the s and as a dedicated squirrel watcher i noticed how many different types there were we eventually counted well over different types based on color tail size markings etc i ve never been anywhere that had so many different kinds my son goes to college with kids from all over the world and one of his first and still best friends is a girl from australia where they dont have squirrels the first time she saw a squirrel she thought it was so cute she cried

we have red squirrels at our cottage they are really destructive will chew through everything people avoid feeding them if they get inside they‚Äôll chew everything one got into my jeep found a chamois shredded it and built a nest on my battery all in one night that said i fill my bird feeders and allow them to feed with the birds apparently chili sauce on the feed will stop them cant do it much more prefer the less destructive chipmunks who don‚Äôt chew anything but the squirrels haven‚Äôt got inside the house so i‚Äôm at peace with them for now as for black squirrels we‚Äôve paid hundreds of to wildlife company‚Äôs to get them out of our house attic in the city over the years
i ve rescued and raised a few squirrels they are the most goddamned gentle creatures in the world when they accept food from you it s incredible how dainty they are about it
mesmerizing i love squirrels sad to say i travel a lot and have hit two despite my best efforts i also just hit two at once they ran out in the road together and i slowed for them to cross i had a car riding me at mph but i couldn t risk hitting them the second squirrel then grabbed the first jumped up in the air with him and body slammed him into the front of my car in what i can only describe as a kamikazi tombstone piledriver they both miraculously survived only to end up on opposite sides of the street staring at each other as only mortal enemies can it was a lot of drama and intrigue for only five seconds

reminds me of my mom when my little mexican siblings and me were little babies
legit question what happens if she has so many babies that they can t all hang on does she leave them to die do they never have that many i must know
she must be exhausted someone should leave her some healthy snacks
that‚Äôs horrifying i‚Äôm not sure why but it‚Äôs a nightmare to me
smart using the babies as defense from an aerial assault
love them amp they re so misunderstood my daughter almost talked me into getting a wildlife license when she was a teenager so we could get a virginia possum too many rules even though they show their teeth snarling amp hissing they re very slow moving amp are actually good for our environment have a fondness for possums amp raccoons just color me positive i love all animals
we were hearing weird squeaky sounds in our home like a bad movie and could not figure out the source finally found one of these babies trying to escape by walking up the glass window the sound happened after it got up several feet and then started sliding down no idea how it‚Äôs feet could do that we could go right up to the glass and it would hiss at us it may have been a tiny toddler but it was scary ugly sharp teeth we opened the door long enough to lean a step ladder against the far wall to the outside next morning it was gone
mother of the year candidate very beneficial animal and and does not get rabies i wish i had in my neighborhood to eat the ticks bring on the babies
i shall never complain about carrying groceries again
i love these guys i feel so awful this time of the year when they re out and wandering they have no clue about cars and too many assholes don t mind hitting them a buddy of mine was living in a big house in detroit with a bunch of other grad students a year ago near the wayne state campus it was one of only a couple of houses left on the block they rest had been abandoned and torn down the trees and brush had started reclaiming the neighborhood with that came raccoons woodchucks and sometimes a deer or two yes deer there are some huge expanses of now vacant land that have regrown dense enough to allow wildlife to return anyway he met cyrano his possum smoking buddy cyrano would stop by their back porch around every night to say hi and get snacks he d just hang out with whoever was out having a smoke after a while he d head back to do possum stuff down the block
i ve learned to be not quite as terrified of them as i used to be they love my back yard for some reason i hear they keep the tick population down
i thought this was an opossum wearing a fur coat at first glance so precious though üòç
i count babies my mom counted but i think that s a bit of fur on the far side of her didn t anyone else come just to see who else counted the babies

üòÇüòÇüòÇ the little guy at the end who cant fit under then falls off and chases after mom
i don‚Äôt think people understand how mean opossums really are
live look at my wife and our kids when i walk in the door from work
mom children behave or i ll turn around and we can go home

i don‚Äôt like their toe placement it weirds me out otherwise pretty cute
reminds me of when we were little and me and my sister would hang onto my dads legs while he tried to walk around
as a mother of extremely clingy children i relate to this in my very soul
oppums are treasures and should be treated and such
possums are the best lt we used to have a mother and her adolescent son living under our porch they d come out at night to investigate and we d leave out watermelon and cantaloupe halves for them
oh look it‚Äôs arya stark carrying the last few seasons
so i guess you all would hate my rat terrier mix who recently killed off adolescent possum whose parents thought it was a good idea to nest in a dog s yard
opossums are fucking great imagine a dude getting attacked and they want to kill him and the mfer just fucking lies down like holy shit they are the true definition of bad boys
damn that s a busy momma or should i say bus momma signals rim shot
opossums eat massive amounts of ticks if this doesn t want you to keep them around go walk around in the woods for a while and get lots of ticks on you to help change your mind
had a rat trap outside with peanutbutter heard it snap and get dragged i ran outside it was one these little fellers with his paw stuck in it and just stared me down amd looked at the trap like look what the fuck youve done to me and wouldnt move i brought out a rubber baking glove and greed him while he kept his mouth open you know just in case i wasnt gonna remedy what i did to him after he was free he just slowly limped away in a way it looked like he was murmuring to him self this fucking guy i still feel super horrible thinking back i hope hes ok
this is why we need planned parenthood i‚Äôm taking a risk by posting this
remember the mom will eat about ticks this summer so be nice to them
no aww possums can be freaking mean like proper angry fuckers
imagine making your own children into a suit of armor
any other weird shit these things do that i don‚Äôt know about
its so gosh darn cute that they carry their babies like that
man i always go back and forth on possums are they cute or jotü§îü§îü§îü§î
this is a video of a person carrying his squad in counter strike
til the o in oppussom is silent i always thought it was strange that australia have possums but america had opossums not anymore
curious brit here is there a difference between an opossum and a possum
what‚Äôs the difference between a possum and an opossum
an animal that is resistant to rabies and eats fleas and ticks aka why i wish we had more around here
there are two reasons the mom possum does this a tooth proof vest to carry her babies
i can‚Äôt even imagine carrying a single kid on my back much less a legion of trash babies
best thing i ve seen all day no kittens or puppies have made me smile and laugh this hard cheers to you opossum mommy and babes you win the internet this day
she should get a pass to skip to the front of any starbucks line umm i m sorry human woman did you only have to deal with caring and feeding for or babies at a time on hours sleep back of the line sister
my mom once found a dead opossum on the side of the road she could see that the baby on her back was still alive since she was on her way to work she picked it up and put inside her shirt to keep it warm and then called me to come pick it up and take it home for her so i came and got it and drove home with a baby opossum inside my armpit every time i would try to move it would hiss at me not exactly a pleasant experience but was pretty funny we eventually handed it off to a wildlife sanctuary nearby pretty cool animals
and humans complain about their kids hanging all over them
there is a baby possum living in my front yard i am guessing it lost its momma
i remember while driving for lyft i was dropping off a fare around am and i saw one that had been hit by a car but it was still upright kinda hunched over and looking at the ground he had this look on his face like it was his first day of school and all the kids said he d never have any friends i felt so bad for him so i picked him up with a towel cause he was bleeding around the nose but he was fighting me to get away which was a good sign i felt and as effeminately as i could i loaded him into my truck bed and called every shelter vet rescue around that might be able to treat him found a drop off rescue that treated him and after calling and checking up on him he got treated and released
why are these animals not allowed inside casinos because they re a bunch of cheetahs
don t normally get into floof language but upvote cuz thats a wicked funny tagline for this pic
roughly of cheetah cubs survive to adulthood amp x b in case you were having a good day
mom mom mom mom mom mom what can we run now i told you not till after the picture is taken
i feel like they don t belong on brown leaves like they should be green or something
is it normal for one to have that many kittens seems like that s an unsustainably large number of little mouths to feed
how common is it for a cheers to have that many cubs
i wish i didn t know what i do about cheetahs survival rate in the wild makes this photo heartbreaking
fun fact there has not been a single recorded case of a cheetah killing a human
they‚Äôre really not dangerous though potentially sure but most time they‚Äôre more nervous scared of us
i love the title it s the perfect name for these ani animals i don t think i ll call them anything different now
cheetahs are dangerous if you‚Äôre a small deer or rabbit
don t talk to me or my son or my son or my son or my son or my son or my son ever again
i saw on a doc the young cheetahs have that light coloring on their backs because they resemble honey badgers i hope that‚Äôs true
the mother just looks like the photographer gave her sass and the cubs are all ‚Äúwhat did you say to my momma ‚Äù
cheetahs are the only cats that don‚Äôt have retractable claws must be related to the speed
that is a mom that is done with their supersonic bullshit
i think i ve watched two much youtube because i m fairly convinced now that cheetah s are basically harmless to people
you don t have to be the fastest just make sure you re not the slowest
the thing is you would think these guys roar they don‚Äôt ùô©ùôùùôöùôÆ ùôéùôåùôêùôÄùòºùôÜ
story goes that cheetah babies are so cute to fend off prey with being so cute how could you eat it
so i wonder at what point do their eyes go from baby black to vicious amber
all of those cheetah kittens likely have hiv so you shouldn t have sodomy with or accept a blood transfusion from one of these kittens
these are the most menacing dandelion seeds i‚Äôve ever seen
from what i ve read cheetahs are the least dangerous big cat of all they re basically big house cats there s never been a confirmed report of a cheetah actually killing a person
not all cubs survive the dry season be lucky if she has three left
don t ever talk to me or my son or my other son or daughter or other son or daughter or other son ever again
their little ears are mega cute they look like little murder cat bears
did you know they look like that to resemble honey badgers
you know how we have dog races what if hear me out what if we do away with those completely because it s a shitty environment for the animals
adorable but danger floof is not the term i d use for a species of chirping bundles of anxiety
til if a cheetah runs too fast it can literally melt overheat their brains and they can die from it
floof floof floof floof floof danger floof floof floof floof
me my son my son son my son son son my son son son son
i ve heard satin defuses animals of the danger variety
ugh baby cheetahs are probably the cutest creature on the planet
bet she burnt the fucker to ashes afterwards for embarrassing her
oh my god how did i read amelia clark being an asshole
talk about being typecast she s going to be called khaleesi for the rest of her life
i know she‚Äôs great but i feel like she‚Äôs stoned always
she is so adorable i can‚Äôt help but smile every time i see her
better with sound and he also throws a coffee cup when he notices her
god damn they actually fit all the titles in there lol
when i become a celebrity do those hand gestures come standard
that lady is one of the few actress who get a pass on repeated movie flops and id never stop watching shes been through alot of crazy shit
mfw i see a repost of something posted hardly a week ago
they cut the best part the mascot is carrying a cup of coffee which he drops when he sees her
emilia clarke is like straight ellen page both are adorable in a really likeable way
really wasn t a fan of her acting the first couple of seasons i ll admit is was mostly just the character herself but damn she was absolutely amazing this season right up there with the best of dinklage and headey during their best seasons
i love how she is still embarrassed whenever this happens i hope it‚Äôs genuine i think it is
this is when i knew the rockets were doomed to lose when she showed up
this was in houston why is she wearing winter weather that day it was hot and well doesn t she run hot being the mother of dragons
is it just me or is she half as attractive as her movie character
legend say that it was the guy who played jorah in the suit
she is just one normal girl and that is what makes her special
the approx four people in the arena who haven‚Äôt watched the show were probably so confused
you lot are some cringeworthy thirsty motherfuckers
love how the bear is just going around doing his business and as soon as he notices our queen drops everything and just kneels
you know something whenever i see gifs of people in such suits whether it be from disneyland or some teams mascot im always really appreciateve of their own acting props up to those people
i hear shits going down with d chick in the series but irl that is the most heartbreakingly adorable reaction ive seen in a while just pure cuteness
everytime i see this i get more creeped out by thumbs up chick behind her
there are cats on that blanket also at least one pig
i prefer catdog but unfortunately they seem to be very rare
i still absolutely adore cats but if i had a choice it‚Äôd be a dog for me i just love their energy cats are still great though
well for some reason you find it necessary to give me scars on my forearms and lap
i love cats but cats literally kill me and dogs don t
i am not a dog person but from what i have gathered it‚Äôs because dogs will love you unconditionally and because dog people are dumb
the retractable sharp claws coming at me when i want to go for belly rubs is one reason
i m extremely allergic to cats and therefore don t find them enjoyable
allergic to cats i‚Äôm legally required by the universe to dislike them for my own good
cats don‚Äôt care about you they see you as ‚Äògives food‚Äô they get what they want and continuously attack scratch and bit whilst never regretting it or feeling bad ‚Äòa spawn of satan‚Äô dogs would never attack you they loves you more then you love them they get depressed when they don‚Äôt see you for long periods of time ‚Äòmans best friend‚Äô
you make me sneeze doggo doesn t but you are majestic
i have an almost identical cat the cheeks on yours are a bit pudgier though p
my cat looks just like that and i have that same exact dog blanket thought this was my picture for a second haha
anyone else try and find their dogs breed on the blanket i didn t see a chow chow though
i was until i got my first cat no way i can go back to dogs now üòÇ
i have a cat allergy that caused me to uncontrollably sneeze and my throat swells up until i can t breath that doesn t stop me from giving massive hugs and kisses to all the cats
i have a cat and she s annoying i take care of her because i m not a complete asshole but my kid ex wanted her not me personally i don t want to take care of any living thing at least cats are relatively low maintenance though
ok i don‚Äôt like cats as much as dogs but i‚Äôm not saying cats are dumb or not adorable
i think i am an all animal person i would love a dog cat fish lizard and bird
alright here we go i love dogs i love cats i love most animals but as a companion i would choose a dog for a bunch of reasons they are generally pack animals and they fit better into a family and has his own place in the family hierarchy they can be trained to perform a variety of useful tasks cats can too but not as much as dogs and dogs are fiercely loyal which i find adorable in the past years i have raised dogs and cats i love them both but if i had to choose ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
cats are evil little shits and if they looked like frogs you d all agree
i thought i was a dog person until i found a cat under my porch
i m allergic to cats so i m a dog person because they don t cause my body to attack itself
two words litter box i love cats but having a litter box in the house is just something i m not fond of
dog can bite robbers jugular cat judges you as you get robbed
i like social cats i hate social cats in the middle of the night i like social dogs i don t particularly dislike social dogs in the middle of the night because like me they stay the fuck asleep cats don t warn you when someone is trying to break in they hide and watch dogs will bark so loud it ll wake the neighbours when someone tries to break in you can train a dog to give up when you re not paying attention to it and wait patiently for when you are available a cat does not wait for you to do whatever it is you need to do if you fail to give it the attention and or amusement it desires it will proceed to knock everything on the floor and if that doesn t work it ll start hiding stuff cats are great if you want a non human child in your life dogs are better companions hands down
this looks just like my cat buffy blue eyes and everything is her tail striped black and grey like a raccoon cute
lays on the therapist couch it all started when i was seven my dad got me a pit bull that‚Äôs it pit bulls are fucking awesome
i don‚Äôt know if a dog person but i know for sure that i‚Äôm not a people person
someone tell me what kind of cat this is right meow
i m allergic to cats still love them as much as dogs tho
i used to be a dog person solely because i don t like fur on my counters i love cooking but then i met a cat dog fun as all hell and self cleaning i m sold
the way the cat is on a dog blanket cracks me up power move
if you pray enough you can change yourself into a cat person
seems like the cat is even a dog person rather lay on a dog blanket than a cat blanket
i am a dog person because for me looking into the eyes of a cat is just like staring into the portals of pure evil
dogs don t make me pick me up dead lizards and accidentally touch the gut of a dead mouse
mildly allergic depending how well the cat keeps itself clean
they dont poop in a box step in poop and walk across my counters and furniture while i m sleeping
if that were a dog on a cat blanket it would say ‚Äúyou love cats i love cats where are cats ‚Äù that‚Äôs why i‚Äôm a dog person
i like them both just dogs a little more they are so cute
what kind of breed is this looks like my cat when i was a kid
you should get your vision checked i am a cat person
i like cats but the dog at least pretends to look sorry when he throws up on my slippers
because he will not let you scratch his tummy thats why
i used to be a dog person since i grew up with cats but my cat nala was like a small dog i just grew to love both then nala killed my beloved frog and i just was so devastated i turned into a dog person on that day p s i love nala and your cat reminds me of her i actually teared up a bit
asthma cat allergies me nearly dying overnight from cuddling with cat every damn time i wake up unable to breathe with a cat still like em tho
only a cat person would post this no amount of explaination will enlighten a goldfish as to why it doesn t know it s a goldfish either
a dog is loyal af you can learn a lot of things to a dog they can be very disciplined brave and live for their boss there are many dogs who have real jobs helping people who really need it never saw a cat do that if you found one congrats but i am not interested in those links besides a cat just a lazy way to say i love pets but i am to lazy to take care of it properly outcome take a cat or a goldfish
i m allergic to cats i m soooo sorry you beautiful furry ball of anger
my dog scares bears away cats attack my feet as i walk by fuck cats
my dog is currently laid across my legs i cannot move my food supply and water has already ran out and i m scared i won t survive this i don t want to wake her tho
cats are kind of an environmental danger when you live in the countryside i have seen entire villages where birds don t sing it s weird and eerie and more than a little bit wrong
dogs believe you are gods and cats believe they are a god it depends on what you want out of your animal
gosh i havent even met the cat yet and it already hates me that is why
you can t go jogging with a cat but i do have both a cat and a dog both adopted and rescued
dog big and fluffy cat makes family sick dog will be outwardly affectionate cat is tsundere as fuck but i tell you secret i love cats too but i must wait until time is right when the roof above me is mine then i shall acquire cat and their name shall be jiji
cats will eat you when you die in your own home no problem cats are selfish af dogs don‚Äôt
op i think your dog is broken it has such a weird looking
the expression on this cat reminds me of a counselor saying tell me how does that make you feel
dogs are better not really a discussion i like your cat though
well little one it s not that i m a dog person i love you both equally it s just that when i turned thirteen years old i suddenly became allergic to your kind s saliva and to this day it makes me suffer i still love you and will often risk my own comfort just to give you lovin
i have this same blanket but with cats on it my cat fucking loves it
could you put a banana next to the penny so i could have a frame of reference on size
there‚Äôs only man who is afraid of that thing i think it was the falling down the well that shook him up though bats were just at the wrong place at the wrong time should be heightsman or wellman or playingnearwellsman but he chooses batman what a dork
i know there‚Äôs a penny for scale but i‚Äôm still having trouble visualizing how tiny he is thanks for helping him out
thank you bats are so important people don‚Äôt realize the huge amount of mosquitos they eat
i can‚Äôt compute the size without a god damn banana thanks internet
i really appreciate you helping this little dude it‚Äôs not easy finding the right people willing to care for a bat
thank you for saving this little one bats are awesome
thank you for your kindness too the little one and to the recovery rescue upvote x
they are so beautiful and so underrated thank you for saving him her
should ve called dwight shrute he knows how to deal with these kinds of things
i thought you were gonna try to top the other guy on the front page who got something drops of water on a penny
i mean who doesn‚Äôt just need a dropper of sugar water once in a while
i had a pet bat in school i named him bruce bruce vanished one day
please be very careful in handling him bats that are found inside likely have rabies that made them disoriented bites may not be noticeable if there s any chance you were bitten you need to get the rabies vaccines but thank you for saving him bats serve a really important ecological function in the environment
i love bats üíû so glad you guys were able to help the cutie
awww üòç i absolutely adore bats thank you for helping him her
good job kiba but what about that candyfloss woofer in the back
anyone else see elijah wood in t h is pupper s face
i wish i could find a chocolate lab with those eyes
that‚Äôs a cute small to medium sized doggo you have on your hands
hooray i have never had gallbladder problems but people tell me that they are no fun at all healthy ear skritches ‚ù§Ô∏è
wait we need more pics of the pink one hows the fur pink looks sooo cute
i keep breaking monitors attempting to boop is snoot amp x b what breed of pupper is this doggo
holy shit i love him so much sorry i just get really excited when i see cute doggos
my dogs name is kiba too the person who named him was an anime nerd and i kept it cause it s all he responds to
that looks more like the beginning of the day though lol
honestly those cats would not let you game for more then minutes
why are there two controllers but just breakfast for one is this sexism
i refuse to believe the cats would leave that food a lone
this is definitely not ops picture this is something off of tumblr
for a little but then when you‚Äôre trying to do air rolls and get fancy the cat always fucks it up and you whiff entirely
kinda looks like a photo designed to highlight having everything in your life except a so seriously
the behind the scenes footage of this shot would be really top notch
exchange whatever is on that tray for some weed and wraps and you re spot on
this literally gives me anxiety those cats are going to eat all of that
and what angle is this you have a ceiling mounted camera indoor drone
can i switch places with you just for a day that looks lovely my life isn t that bad but i really want some cats to cuddle
there are two remotes and by the way the food is placed on the bed there isn t any plans for a player
also how this dude player who are they playing with the cats
this just makes me want to cannonball the bed and send everything flying off to ruin the shot
her controller isn t even connected yet it s searching fakest photo ever but cute cats
laying at odd angle with two attentio seeking cats tempting the stability of a food tray on a large bed while trying to game i ll pass
i refuse to believe that the cats won‚Äôt knock over that cup
yes this is very ideal for any time of day actually
yes eating your favorite snacks while playing and cuddling with your favorite pets lt
they re gonna knock over the shit out of that coffee
why is the coffee black why is there no milk in the bowl and why are there what seem to be slices of bread with nothing on them so many curiosities
i m missing several chocolate bars but otherwise hell yeah
those aren‚Äôt dogs those aren‚Äôt ps controllers and that isn‚Äôt beer and chips
controller isn t connected i do not want an existential crisis where i think i m playing games while looking at a blank wall thank you
that s not what someone would look forward to eating at the end of the day
the thing i want the most out of this picture after work is the daylight
change the breakfast tray for pizza and i‚Äôd say yes
i m not sure if i d want to eat eggs with raw mushrooms for breakfast though
my cats would have pawed the eggs and licked all the butter off the toast before quietly farting and leaving
playing though i mean that s almost console generations behind
how can you guys eat with your pet s ass so close to your food the amount of fur in the air is sickening and in your food
hard boiled eggs dry bread granola and weak ass tea with no milk on either any chance i can have the situation without that terrible breakfast
other person sits down in bed and spills the food everywhere
why are you living in the dark ages with a go back to the stone age
i always snack on deviled eggs angel food cake and walnuts with fried rice when i m gaming with my cats wash it down with a cup of tea
you re a hungry one oatmeal in bed is a bold choice is player taking the picture
question is he named after the norse marvel or stargate
gasp smiley thor needs many chest scratchies bestow this upon him
good lookin dog but dont understand why you named him after my penis
adorable dog mine rejoices in waking me upby farting
which shelter did your family pick him up from was a dog like him same name at a shelter in monmouth always wanted to know where he went amp if he‚Äôs doing ok
does he accept hugs maybe head kisses i frickin love his smile
thor must make everyone smile he is such a smiley handsome pup
if the camera angle were just a little lower we would be able to see that he has a thor throat
holy shit reddit hates pit bulls most of them probably don‚Äôt even have one
reading the title this kid and seeing a literal kid standing right there in the first few seconds was confusing
i love me a man that s not afraid to express emotion ‚ù§Ô∏è
my father was my best man for my wedding unfortunately he passed a month later treasure it and congrats
great and very touching video but it seems like op didn‚Äôt think we were going to be able to read the title of the post that they shared
i don t have family so i love to see moments like this
i love this it s wholesome moments like these that remind me that not everyone is a piece of shit
ho i just felt that i have a heart for the first time today
was confused due to the annoying pointless kid in background had to watch it x wonder how many times that kid distracted someone just being a kid
this is sweet something about older men crying always makes me cry
i can t imagine my life without my dad he s almost so i know i m only getting a few good years with him at this point
i kept waiting for the cake to pull apart or something lololol
can someone loop this so he s pulling out money for like a solid mins
anyone else really want the cake to explode at the end
that cake is as empty as a new bag of lays you gonna cut into it and get mostly air
pretty mittens we must see the tinies when they arrive
very cute but please get her spayed there are too many kittens in shelters as it is
please get her spayed after the kittens are weaned it s sad enough seeing a dog s maternity photos but cat overpopulation is even worse than it is for dogs downvote me all you want but your pet being pregnant is not cute nor is it something to celebrate when shelters are constantly having to turn cats away or euthanize them pregnant or not because they physically have no room supplies fosters for them
there are so many animals in shelters that will probably never be adopted and your greatest concern is taking maternity photos for your cat lord help the world fix your pets people it could be free if you do your research if you can t afford it
what a lovely idea and beautiful girl she‚Äôll make gorgeous babies i have a zelda too
theae might be some of the most adorable cat photos i ve ever seen
that looks strikingly similar to my male cat one of us is being lied to
new baby kittens have to come from somewhere and looks like this time they‚Äôll be from zelda cute pregnant cat photos
she‚Äôs gorgeous i love it please post pics of the kittens once she delivers
this is everything now you have to post pictures after the big event
omg you can‚Äôt even post cute pregger pics of your cat without people standing on a soap box
americans pay to have thousands of cats and dogs killed every day you are an asshole for letting your cat reproduce you contribute to my tax dollars being spent to kill animals
wow not only did you dress up your cat and take photos you also named her zelda do you have any friends
the color of the flower and the blue of the shirt combines so well it makes the photo look so adorable and warm love it lt
let me guess year old single woman that has no man in her life also you should have spayed your cat way to be irresponsible i can‚Äôt believe people don‚Äôt get this way to glorify a large problem that is fat overpopulation
st pic blissful nd pic even more bliss rd pic starting sleeping bliss th pic bladder piss
if you get another cat it should be called link and if another ganon
my cat s name is sheik and she is the darker version of your cat like if you inversed their colors we could swap cats and neither of us would be able to tell well i would when my spayed cat had kittens and you would probably be pretty freaked out when your pregnant cat suddenly wasn t
i dunno why people are having a fit let the person enjoy their pregnant cat and their future kittens
she is radiant op my tabby boy zeldin approves too with a nose boop to her pictures
your cat is beautiful and i m sure the kittens will be too as for all the lecturing you ve received here although most was well intentioned you handled it with plenty of grace positivity and patience you sound like a truly caring and responsible pet owner and that you obviously already know what to do continue exactly what you re doing and enjoy the new little family üêæ üòªüíìüêæ
a cat does not seem to be a stray way too comfortable b poster doesn t even seem to say that just that they would get her spayed and oops accident c anyone saying hey spay and neuter dummy is getting downvoted d have you ever tried putting clothes on a stray cat e has anyone on this sub ever even been to a kill shelter good gravy
my cat is pregnant lets dress her up like a doll for internet points
super cat she s so adorable and gorgeous can i have kitty hihi
you really brought out the blue in her eyes and the pink in her nose üíï

spay and neuter your pets people it s like bob barker was talking to himself
smh take the damn dress off quit posing your cat glad you plan to get her spayed and have plans for the kittens but it should have already happened clearly you have the time to do so
thanks but for some reason i feel like it is logically impossible to have a happy national endangered species day
¬´¬†national endangered species day¬†¬ª like you can continue to fuck the world over the rest of the year and you want this to be happy man we are truly fucked
happy global species extinction crisis day be happy
is there a sub focussing on endangered and extinct species
theirs nothing happy about endangered species day so sad to learn about it
someone get that cheetah an agent so fabulous and with so much sass
i feel like it s almost cheetahing posting something this adorable in an attempt to hit the front page
i like lemons sometimes my farts smell like an old lady s telephone oh to be a fly in my neighbors hat when he hears about the honey wagon
it s okay olive when you start dropping brown bombs then it s time to be scared
my dog scares himself awake jumps up turns around sniffs his bum and lays back down daily
my uncle used to blame all his farts on the dog eventually the dog would leave the room the moment my uncle farted
the farts that scare me don‚Äôt make me run to my bed
mine once farted scared herself and bit herself on her own arse in surprise retaliation
my dog didn‚Äôt fart often but when she did she‚Äôd look at her butt quizzically it was very funny
this dog looks so much like my old dog that passed away years ago i miss her so much was
my dog farts looks at me all offended then walks away
mine will fart wake himself up sniff his butt judge if it s bad and then leave the room leaving the rest of us to deal with it while he just escapes
i was working in a house with customers who were healthy eaters and they also fed their dog healthy i watched them feed the dog olives and boiled eggs talk about dog farts i was gagging on it
dear olive i did the same thing today and there is no shame you do your thang and pay no mind to those other bitches keep wagging that gorgeous tail
i had a rescue that would run and hide after farting i think his previous owners yelled at him for it
your furmom will not get mad at you because of that look hahaha
my dog has torn her acl in both back legs which has resulted in her being terrified of stairs so i have to carry her up and down all stairs every time i pick her up for this she farts and then licks my face she s a pound husky
scared they were just fleeing the scene of the crime that‚Äôs all smart doggo üëå
‚Äúi can literally smell the neighbours bo across the street that stink is uncalled for ‚Äù
my farts scare me too sometimes especially when they wake me up from my sleep and i think satan paid a visit from sulfur hell
til that dogs are capable of fear of their own farts
dogs are funny farters my cats favorite thing is jumping on my lap looking at me like she had just told the greatest joke ever as my eyes start to water and i start gasping for breath
office ladies‚Äô farts ripping out from their tight executive pencil skirts smelling like putrid rotten eggs very cute amp sexy üòä
i like to call it rocket power the little guy releases a root and does a little run around the living room
i had a dog that would bark but be scared so he would run next to me to try and protect me but also because he was so scared he died so now i have another chihuahua who is scared of everything but still loves me
my cat once farted in his own face while sleeping and woke up with this look of utter terror like i started the vacuum next to him
roses are red poetry is art wanted the walkies but just for a fart
my question is whether she got spooked by the sound or the smell
my german shep used to fart and after a while look humans in disgust then move to another room she also woke herself up several times by farting
my dog pickle use to stand acting normal then all of suddenly yelp in agony and look at her ass as if it had hurt her poor dog she ran sideways as well and had bad allergies
i have a frenchie this whole running away scared from their own farts does not compute
aw olive could be friends with my cat she poops in the litter box then gets startled by her own poop and runs away when she turns around and sees it
my dog always looks at her butt confused when she farts olive is a gorgeous pup
dogs get a lot of information from smells he probably farted an embarrassing memory and ran away trying not to experience it again
i d get scared too if i heard a loud noise and something flapped my anus
mine does then then furiously runs on the wood floors sliding a full on freakout every time
what a sweet design for her bed and what a sweetie she is sweet
we used to have a dog that would fart get scared start running and be farting the whole time thus scaring him more i miss that dog
olive you‚Äôre such a beautiful girl there‚Äôs nothing wrong with farting it‚Äôs a very natural thing the only reason they stink is to let deaf people appreciate them too so don‚Äôt be scared just make sure people are around to enjoy them cheers
so i ve never heard a dog fart i was under the impression that unless there is something for the gas to reverberate against there would only be the quiet expulsion of gas i ve had quite a few dogs as well
god i love these guys i didn t know they could have different colors of fur look at his little facial fur and his curly tail i love it
i can image you just walking outside and the whiskey jack just flew on your arm to say hello d

by day she is simply a loveable shanti however by night
shanti is like a mysterious girl that you want as a girlfriend but you will never understand her
naive lil guy just wanted to sleep with the fishes this is what happens when you leave the sopranos on when you leave the house
is that what they mean when they say that a dogs a rescue
‚Äúare you okay you sank so quickly were you in the rock garden again ‚Äù ‚Äúno ‚Äù coughs up pebble
am i an asshole for laughing i m sorry takes myself off to the naughty corner
he shouldn‚Äôt have had those dogs chasing him around pool to begin with
"i believe a dog has to have two basic skills to be called a dog swimming breathing
a hamster is more of a dog than this thing is not dissing hamsters they‚Äôre cool"
he s soooo cute there s something unusual about his gait is that a trait of the breed
his tail is gonna wack over everything in it s path when he gets older
from the thumbnail i thought cocoa had a little cast on i was about to be really sad

welcome to accidents chewed up random things not enough sleep diminished social life and then lots and lots and lots of love
looks like letterkenny has residents such a good boy

i also have a gus your gus looks very nice by the way
no one could ever guess this adorable pup is actually a drug kingpin
he s got eyes of a grey wolf puppy gorgeous child you got yourself dude
gus don t be exactly half of an eleven pound black forest ham
is it just me or does your dog look like it‚Äôs taking a snapchat selfie with the baby
haha our dogs can‚Äôt help but get involved anytime we want to take pictures also she looks to be sitting up really good for months our little guy is months but he just started sitting up within the last month
he‚Äòs like ‚Äûwhat are you doing take the opportunity and just run as long as she is distracted ‚Äú
when you definitely smelt it but you don t say anything because you don t want to be blamed as the one who dealt it
usually hates pictures camera goes to something else haaaaaaay
beagles are the greatest dogs however clearly they‚Äôre not always the most photogenic
be prepared to stay in that spot for a long time months is a long wait
that dog looks like the guy who accidentally photobombed a wedding photo by riding a bike in front of the camera
k upvotes only comments none of which above upvotes and an obviously shopped picture seems very fishy
looks like someone holding the dog up and the dog is not happy about it
forget baby im the baby ur gonna be stuck with that baby for years ill be gone in
sorta looks like that meme of that young girl that is running away from something
five months seems like an awfully long time to take a picture
the dogs placement in the picture looks a bit too shopped still its a good photo
i m just scrolling thru reddit i see a baby ok i just scroll down and see a dog that dog is the face i made when i saw that dog still cute tho
"op you should be having enough money for giving a white shirt to your baby it easily become dirty and a big stuffed toy they are expensive and that‚Äôs a excellent bed baby couch maybe and a fancy cushion the best part is that your baby and dog are so cute üòä
have a good life"
this is obviously you holding him in front of the camera with one arm while taking the picture with the other dogs roll their eyes back like that when they re being leaned back not when jumping
frame that bad boy somebody needs to photoshop a green screen or whatever around the dog so we can get a new meme format up in this bitch this has potential to be something like the pikachu face
i‚Äôve seen many dogs make this face when they are getting their temperature checked at the vet
might be just me but ir kinda looks fake it looks cut out and placed in im not saying that it s fake tho
i can smell good things goin on i have to be a part of it the good doggo
your dog knows wassup lol who gives a shit about your baby they all look the same bruh
someone cut the dog head out and place it on a meme format
the pic without the dog is quite good priceless with dog
karen how dare you abandon me we were best friends karen why did you do this to me
this has to be shopped but either way it has meme potential
how do you feel about raising a literal fleshlight for highschool jocks and college fratbros the little whore will be passed around like a cigarette at least make some use of her and serve her as dinner for your dog
i can already see this dog get cut out of the picture and then used in thousands of memes i love the picture though it s great and brings smiles
cute kid your dog however looks stupid with that pink bow on its head
this was the best picture to scroll on mobile looks like a normal picture of a baby then bam dog jump scare
excellent example of photo bombing your daughter is lovely
this is what my parents look like on every video call
he looks like he‚Äôs very worried that i‚Äôm going to downvote but rest easy good boy because i‚Äôm about to upvote
why is it that the last few pictures i ve seen like this the dog usually has a similar expression lol
do i have your permission to crop the pic so the doggo s face is the only thing and use it for a meme template
this looks suspiciously photoshopped the xontrasting colours of the dog doesnt match the lighting from the original picture
to remind you that nobody outside of your family cares about pictures of your wobbly ball of flesh
is the baby sitting up at months or propped on the couch
thats what my brothers dog said when my nephew was born
and this will always be your favourite photo from this set of photographs
the reactions in this thread are a good example of why i would never upload pictures or videos i caught of something special happening because while i know it to be stupid i d probably still get unnecessary annoyed and defensive about all the comments accusing it of being fake
it is alarmingly difficult for people to just look at photos without needing to put their cents in on whether or not it is ‚Äòphotoshopped‚Äô just start enjoying shit please
the dog s face looks like a grandma mistakenly taking a selfie
well if you leave the shutter open that length of time what do you expect
haha my dog pulls the exact same face when she‚Äôs like ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs going on guys ‚Äù
could just make an interesting title instead of lying
that dog looks like me when i see myself in the mirror when i get up early
oh no what will all of your friends do without that mo picture
gt month picture ah yes i remember doing all this cutesy stuff with my first born that shit goes right out the window with the second child
i d capture a black hole picture with such a long exposure time
cropp the background picture and i can see this dog become a meme
looks like the dog is trying to take a selfie with the baby
she‚Äôs so cute and doing such a great job sitting unassisted doggo is hilarious
can t understand how people can put photos of their babies online unredacted grave violation of the rights of the childs to decide for themselves when they are old enough if they want to expose themselves in such a way
you re gonna be much happier with this on the wall in years
please send help it s been months i m the cute one here
that s what happens when you take months to take a picture
i m jealous your daughter is posing so well my wife and i tried to do these pictures and every single month our daughter refused haha
when your owner asks whose a good boy but you don t know who is
someone should photoshop the dog in other stuff as a reaction
eloise gail is such a classy name i love how old fashioned names are making a comeback
it kinda looks like the baby and the dog are generated on a green screen and the dog it a person looking at the camera
tiful are we getting a new dawg named tiful dog probably
i used to be the one to get all the attention and treatos karen lol
i feel sorry for people who don t know how much fun it is to own a dog
it looks like youre holding his front legs up and he s like get off me man
this is really strong meme material right there hold on to it
my middle name is gail i truly thought the name died
this op is violating rule that isn t there dog this is photoshopped for karma no false claims of content ownership
i don‚Äôt know which is cuter the doggo the baby or the teddy bear
pro tip get closer to your subject unless of course you really feel the need to have the stairs and floor in the shot not to mention the doggo
dog day the small creature is forcing my mom to worship her
more like someone is holding the dog still funny tho
i was scrolling down as u do i saw the baby then got jumpscared by the dog lmao
beagle be like my bad thought it was food you were holding anyhow mma go to sleep for hours now wait food oh sorry thought you said something never mind
it‚Äôs so close to the dogs neck is there a protective scarf for him her
this is really entertaining could watch for hours hahha such a funny dog
they said ‚Äúa night at the roxbury‚Äù is a good movie to keep a dog calm at the groomers
i get annoyed sometimes about reposts but this will never be one
i don t think i ll ever not updoot this gif it s been reposted more times than i can count and i still love it
she s using her thumb and index finger to waggle the dogs neck still looks cute but this was taken from me and i will take it from all of you too
i have seen this before but it is so hard for me to believe this little one is dancing and doing it better than me
i don t care how often this is reposted i wall always upvote this little guy
someone a bit away played rockefeller street while i saw this damn it fits
hold the phone i know this is a repost but is that door automatic
honest question and probably a dumb one but why do people repost just to boost karma vicariously
gt police dog oh there s no way this comment section could go to shit
i know i should keep away but i know i don‚Äôt want to
hold on a second this same guy also reposted the bird video that got to the front page a couple days ago
i m really disappointing this isn t a police dog playing keep away with officers
this gifs quality has really suffered due to the rehashing
the blue stripe on the flag means this department is definitely corrupt but aren t they all lol smh
a plainclothes philadelphia police detective in an unmarked car shot a panhandler monday night copaganda abounds
it s really hard to not want to think of using the as warm pillows
i think you meant to use the term loaf of bread you‚Äôre welcome
one could argue that this is an evolutionary advantage as this is the most heat efficient shape due to the ideal volume surface area proportions
trevor was beginning to regret eating those cans of raw biscuit dough and laying in the sun
i am the mountain i am the seal you can t take fat away from me
that‚Äôs just his winter body he needs to keep warm ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
on my th slice of an xl pizza i was to be sharing with my family
"water got the funk
but i m a sexy chonk i see she s a cutie
i m gonna go over and give that booty the bonk sean go home you re high on fugu"
i‚Äôm not a vet but i‚Äôve seen a lot of harbor seals and have rescued treated several pups and something about this animal doesn‚Äôt seem right i‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs in captivity due to injury or illness and isn‚Äôt getting adequate exercise but damn these guys are meant to be quite hefty but this poor thing is too big and looks miserable üòø
was this at an aquarium in japan i swear i saw this same seal ball
how i feel after i just binge watched an entire series on netflix
seals one of the few creatures on earth that can actually decide if it wants to have a head today
reminds me of that monty python scene waffer thin meat
spheres have the highest volume per surface area of any shape and are ideal for retaining warmth
this could just be a rock with a seal face and i would be none the wiser
this both pleases me and makes me deeply uncomfortable
i never knew that seals laid eggs and i learned something today
hahahaha think i saw travolta doing that with some one or was that dancing with the stars
i‚Äôm curious to see what u gifreversingbot has to say about this
"when you re a jet you re a jet all the way
from your first cigarette
to your last dyin day"
this is the doggy pose of ready to play it s like they are daring the other one to start the game first
the frenchie is leading the poodle is following a fraction of a second later those are some quick reflexes
hopefully phishdanceparty will add some music to this
first doggo is this mirror doggo second doggo is this mirror doggo
anyone else picturing them at a sock hop with his little varsity sweater and her in a poodle skirt
why cant i attach audio files kony would fit so well here
we laugh at this but they might be still be stucked in that dance cause no one wants to give up
i m gonna go learn video editing real quick so i can make this an infinite loop to some trap beat
the frenchie reminds me of a friend‚Äôs dog he was an ex marine who became a fitness instructor built like a mack truck probably could‚Äôve had a decent career in pro wrestling he wanted a dog and went to the shelter to look at rescues and ended up with a little french bulldog puppy named queenie now queenie is queen of the gym with a little pink bow tie on her collar and a big tough dad who loves his little cutie
record him howling play the recording back and watch him howl to himself howling
that made me smile so much he‚Äôs adorable and the ears omg
omg how did you teach him my dog does that but never on command
we used to do cd training every year in the guard and the state police would bring the dogs i will never forget the lone black gsd he was running a whole different exe from the other gsd he was a calm baaad mf‚Äôer
i played your video downstairs in my basement and seconds in i heard from upstairs my dog‚Äôs collar as he snapped awake from a dead sleep so that howl is doggie approved btw he is very cute obviously
you should not teach a puppy or kitten things you don t want them doing when they are grown up because then you have to reprimand them for it and they will not understand why you are hassling them over something you yourself encouraged them to do from an early age
‚Äúshut the fuck up‚Äù your irritated neighbors from the future probably
he s learning the ancient secret that sensei taught the twighlight bark
now if only i could put at least half as much effort into my life as this little dude puts into his howl
he s so excited to howl his little peewee plopped out
my dad used to give the dogs ‚Äúsinging practice‚Äù on the way to the beach unfortunately we need to drive that stretch of road for lots of other stuff me talking to friend in car ‚Äúbrace yourself‚Äù friend ‚Äúwha ‚Äù dogs right in his ear ‚Äúarrraaawooowwooowooooowoooooooooooooo‚Äù
on behalf of everyone who will ever live within m of you fuck you
now he can tell you ‚Äúsomeone is breaking into the neighbors house disguised as the neighbor ‚Äù
wow i thought he was half husky or something as well great times to you guys
i tried so hard to get my girl to howl but from day one she s just looked at me like i m an idiot i ve showed her zootopia on many occasions and nothing i m glad yours is more cooperative
hey we did this so that we could then teach ‚Äúquiet off ‚Äù fantastic opportunity
replace the howling with a command for speak and then reward with a treat each time he does it then use the command ‚Äúquiet‚Äù and reward each time he stops this is actually very useful for obvious reasons and i promise you won‚Äôt regret teaching that
my wife and i do the same thing with our pooch but she doesnt just howl she sings and speaks and all sorts of stuff no regrets plus she only does it when we start it
teach him a command for quiet something i always tell people is don t wait until your dog is being noisy to try to teach them to be quiet which i see far too often
our cairn terrier joined in with some wolves on the tv there after our whole family used to have random howling sessions with him i tried this with two separate rescue choccy labradors and all i got in return were wtf stares
why would you want to teach your dog to be noisy though
i hope you don t have close neighbors they will probably hate you as much as i hate my neighbor
my neighbors hate me because sometimes i ll go out on my back deck and get every dog within a quarter mile going i just like to howl it s very cathartic
fast forward three years why the bleep did i teach him to do this ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨‚èπ‚èπ‚èπüîïüîïüîïüîáüîáüîá
teaching him to awoo is awesome but why did you choose a rude word to teach
years after teaching my dog this he still does it every time i leave the house he howls every time someone‚Äôs at the door howls fire truck goes by howls plane goes overhead you guessed it howls he‚Äôs a coonhound and black lab mix now it‚Äôs not as cute but when you have guests over it‚Äôs a neat thing to show them also your neighbors will love you s
too cute my dog isn t a howler but a talker and i definitely encouraged him to do it early on despite it occasionally be a little annoying now it is also super cute still and gives me a chuckle
actually teaching a dog to bark on cam and is the first step in teaching them to be quite
when i played this video my boy kitty woke from a dead sleep looking around for the doggies played it several times trying to show him the image but he kept looking around the room his sister came running to find out what was going on but couldn t find any goggies either i think the humans may not be the only ones in the household who want a dog
great job with the pups putting in the time and effort to train them early is the only way to go on a much different note you do realize that you are probably going to have every dirty old man on here leaving comments about your boobs right
i love the power treats give you over your pets i am going to train my bulldog to skateboard with treats
i kept watching the puppies about times through and finally noticed there were dogs in the video
i had no idea it was possible for pups to learn that fast nice job
does she know she has too why is it interesting pups learn tricks easily and all the time like they re cute but come on you know what s up
haha that s cute i could just teach my dog to sit with a hand signal but he gets up as soon i turn around
id lose my shit if my family did that been with someone for years fuck that
that s really sweet i felt that my first ex s father was like a father figure to me i wishwe could have kept something like that that s awesome
i was in a similar situation it didn t end up working out well once we both started bringing our new boyfriend s girlfriends dates around the house keep that in mind there may come a time when you will have to face this
wow so much negativity in this thread lol have none of you seriously had an amicable break up where you remained friends or at least civil with your ex
i think that‚Äôs awesome good job being mature and functional you can‚Äôt let the people who really matter leave your life
when my brother got divorced i stayed really close to my sister in law she is the god mother of my son and i probably see her more than my brother sometimes you just develop close relationships with with people in relationships with your family if you get along and love them you sometimes don‚Äôt get a choice when relationships break down
rest easy knowing that they lived the best life they could by your side
so sorry to hear about your loss my little bud passed away almost a year ago and i miss him every day
such a little darling memories of the friendship you shared will always warm a cold world
my condolences he she looks like the goodest doggo üíî
little one is getting all the belly rubs and treats they can handle while they wait for you over the rainbow bridge when i lost my little one i was very distraught didn‚Äôt want to go out didn‚Äôt want to eat didn‚Äôt want to do my hobbies but i realized quick that my dog hated seeing me upset so i knew i had to take action you will find that little spot of happiness and you will ride it out to be end get outside and go do something you like the memory will always be alive inside you and no one can ever take that away from you much love a fellow dog lover
so sorry it s never easy and you never stop thinking about them my thoughts are with you today
my condolences to you as this is never an easy thing to go through my wife and i have our cat gabby is who is now we know her time is coming that is why we each every day with her and have no regrets with all the attention we shower her with
sprawled our like he‚Äôs been on somebody job all day üôÑüòÇ
he‚Äôs been out carousing with his friends all night in the alley
‚Äúwhat yes i still haven‚Äôt caught the red dot leave me alone i‚Äôm tired of trying ‚Äù
i have one just like yours i have a pic of her in one of my posts in my history
i ain t got no type bad kitties is the only thing that i like
looks almost exactly like my cat except demon has a black splotch on his nose area in the white
omg me too both my cats are black and white w mirroring black spots on their noses
my ‚Äúfirst‚Äù cat was the same we had a tabby she had kittens i picked a black and white one out of the litter and named him angel because he looked like our old cat i was and it was cute as hell i miss that little bug he was a snuggly one
the one on the toilet looks just like my boy wally he passed away last year at years old just the best cat with his cuddles and my god did he love it when i had some cheese
my beautiful cat api looked just like these two they are wonderful cattos
you seem to be their type as well seeing as they watch you taking a bath
clearly these two are the lookouts the other two are up to something
ugh your choice your selection your mind we love tuxedos
it‚Äôs not always black and white op then you‚Äôve clearly never seen my cats
i also have a maine coons and they just sit outside of our bathroom doors after we shower
you can‚Äôt trick me op this is clearly just the same cat photoshopped into multiple places in one picture who do you think you are
don‚Äôt tell my calico princess but they‚Äôre my favorite too ‚ô•Ô∏è i had two like them growing up
being cats it s more accurate to say that they have a type
and a great type it is we did not realize until after adopting our dog that we did too two cats tuxedos brother and sister and our dog as well but my cats actually our dog too would never get that close to a tub of water
my type is friends that can hang with me in the bathroom and not make it awkward you win my friend
i understand i have a type too my heart melts for house panters
who see comment this comment in love of america ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
this caption to me at least suggests that you have a romantic relationship with your cats and this makes me sad
u got a thing for perverts well good luck with that
that‚Äôs what i think every time i feed my two black cats and black poodle mixüòÇ
they look like the long lost cousins of our cat very cute best cats tuxedo cats
this guy girl is so happy but then who wouldn t be when today is the best day and you re at a friggin waterfall what s their name
i d even take two seconds your dog is such a cuteeeeee
ok i will hold on a second and look at your dog i love him
what kind of dog is this my in laws have a dog that looks exactly like this and no one has been able to determine a proper breed we just call her a mixed mut when people ask
that s the happiest dog i have ever seen and i ve seen my dog when i get back home after seconds
he‚Äôs the kind of elderly personality we hope to grow into makes me miss my abuelita she had moments like this
it always blows my mind how people think of the elderly as simple or slow or weak they‚Äôve survived more than most of ya ever could and their knowledge is insane also he‚Äôs adorable
i miss my grandpa y all go hug your family and friends show them much needed love
his shirt matches the mirror that s such a grandpa thing to do
i often feel like people at that age just dont care anymore either way they act like they care so they dont let the kids down
my dad has a hat like this and has the same reaction
grandma s reaction is just as adorable and contagious as grandpa s
those ears need to be a permanent fixture on his head
my grandmother is she would love a hat like this and her reaction would be about the same as this grandpa s
pretty sure this is a repost and i think in the original it said grandma
i have never seen anything quite so wholesome made me awww more than some of the puppy things on here
why does it seem like it is losing more pixels every time it‚Äôs reposted
i love how excited the lady is knowing how excited he‚Äôs going to be
aww like this is very much appreciated love our fury friends that dominate but a skin bag is also welcome imho
donnie yen has such a great laugh what movie is this from
‚Äúthanks sakura chan this makes me almost as happy as gunning down all those roundeyes on iwo jima they may have captured me and killed your uncle kenji but they paid for it with a river of blood ‚Äù ‚Äúahaha grandpa‚Äôs just joking kids aren‚Äôt you dad üò°‚Äù
my grandmother passed away sunday night she was but always had the spirit of a young woman the last time i saw her she told me to ‚Äúnever let that man of yours tell you to grow up ‚Äù don‚Äôt worry i won‚Äôt
for in every adult there dwells the child that was and in every child there lies the adult that will be john connolly
he looks like fucking cgi because of his massive head

aw this reminds me of my grandpa he was a stoic man but he had silly moments like this sometimes we have a picture of him sitting perfectly normal at a table with friends at the nursing home but he s wearing a giant afro wig just for fun lol miss him
thank you after a little searching i found them on ebay they re called pinch hats if anyone else is interested
old people are the absolute best i laughed so hard at this
this is adorable it reminds me of my pawpaw he had an awesome sense of humor and was playful as well
this made me bawl i lost my grandpa on the th of may this year before alzheimer s claimed his humor and wit he would laugh at and joke about the silliest things growing old is just a child learning to act like an adult i hope this amazing gentleman never loses his spark
pretty sure that s a grandma saw this posted a while ago as such
god damn this gif has been copied from one potato to another times and then reposted
there is nowhere near enough comments about how this looks like it was filmed on a fucking gameboy
r r r repost also damn has this lost a lot of quality since the last time i saw it
not trying to be racist how does he see is vision majorly impaired
it melts my heart to see how pleased this grandpa is it s so cute and innocent people think the elderly want a lot but in reality they are really easy to satisfied
looks like a great old dude reminds you that inside every old person is a kid wondering what happened
he probably committed or survived genocide in the last great war but awwwwwwwwwwwwww
this is because their generation came up in the post war cultural revolution and didn‚Äôt have access to many if any toys as children children were forced to help support the family so now the elderly are fascinated with even the simplest of toys like this flappy hat source i made it up
he spent the rest of the afternoon trying too stuff it into his pants
welcome to your new home smushie face to the left is the catnip the right is the litter box food goes here in this bowl and the bed is in the back just follow the snuggly human there
oh go back turn around this place is not good enough for you run
when you are older i will explain conservation of mass to you to show you that you were always here
welcome to life little guy i hope you have a good one
extra terrestrial kittens i always knew this day would come
this kitten experienced at least weeks in this world already looks overweight
take me to your leaders and scratch the back of my ears a little more to the left yes that s the spot i ll make sure you survive the colonization process
if human babies were this tiny i wouldn t be so freaked out about giving birth to one can i give birth to a kitten instead
quick i need cc s to restart this mans heart it s no use the cuteness has killed him
i d love one but i don t want to risk having a dog with the tortuous condition that these dogs are prone to breaks my heart
lots of ppl on this thread saying favs have lots of genetic problems health isssues etc they do i‚Äôm just lucky to have two pure cavs that are and and perfectly healthy i am so blessed
omg thanks for the laugh i could see myself doing that
it s all fun and games till your boss finds a giant turd in your next week s financial report
thats weird you usually keep the most important stuff in the too drawer
is that filed under d for dog c for canine or g for good boy
my work is also pretty lax on pets except for the one rule about bringing in puppies i recently had to bring my dog into work because i wasn t going to be home after i was carrying a bunch of stuff so the pup stayed in the car for a second so i could make two trips the second i got in there was no good morning only where s the dog needless to say my pup got his fair share of pets and treats that day
it took me less than half a second to give an upvote once i saw that gorgeous little pup
there‚Äôs no pet policy but they never said anything about a good boy policy
so you re potentially making life hell for those who are really allergic and you re locking a dog in a drawer all day is this good
i need a bigger desk apparently my lbs black lab won t fit in my drawers right now
better call the janitor to vacuum that filthy floor
this is clearly a home office as that is definitely not high traffic carpet also consider vacuuming your floor is gross
still has that puppy in a drawer been like two years now
this is how you get fired and banned from keeping animals for life
i‚Äôve seen this posted multiple times but each time i see it my heart grows three sizes i should probably get some medical attention for that
so does the poor thing just sit in there for hours on end
anyone else not concerned a dog is stuffed in a draw
when you‚Äôre so entitled you don‚Äôt think rules apply to you
just make sure not to store your cat there in case of a fire drill
my divorce was hard on my kids but they turned out alright i sleep in a drawer
if the dog isnt distressed as we see here it s not a big deal this isnt too different from a dog sleeping under a blanket also i d assume owners is present to let him out you know if this puppy was actually being housed in the drawer which is probably not happening
absolutely cute that tiny tail it makes the running look even more adorable
please ignore my stupid am kinda new and don t know how to delete
making‚Äô poor kitty run to cammer in an urban area for internet points
foolish man thing i grow grow and soon will take revenge on the furless ones
very cute quick question how do you trim their nails
super cute but based on the shape of the head and ears it doesn t look like a baby rat maybe a hamster
possibly the cutest video of a cheese boi i have ever seen
i hate rats and mice but that is so damm cute might make me change my mind
not cute awesomely handsome in the true sense of awesome cute is an insult to this creature
you kind of want to take off your hat in his presence
love the white hairs in the dog ears thank you for that dos of cuteness üê∂üíô
that creature was a human in a past life it knows things you ve never dreamed of that is a wise old soul
the curvature on those ear hairs reminds me of trichomes for some reason
though the tongue is more likely there because of missing teeth rather than pleasure
play an asmr video in the background and let your mirror neurons fire away
where do i get one of these not to put my grey to sleep but to wake him up gently
he is clearly is immense pain and is incapable of expressing it

it s the foot plant at the end that got me this time still adorable
i‚Äôm guessing this is a marketing account because all he does is repost
what gets me every time is that the pupper closes the yes at the same time with the foot plant it s just too darn adorable
i think this is myaussiegal on instagram she does full dance routines with her owner it s ridiculously cool

if them cheeks are thicc in the face then think about his her tooshie
hate that i noticed how crooked the outlet was before the husky lol
the reaction everyone has when you ask your mom can we have pizza and she says yes
grats on getting your husky to sit still long enough to do that
oh my goddddd i don t know how i will make it through life without squishing that face
my first impression was more of a mouse than a bunny
"i feel bad for the dog
imagine someone pinching your cheeks but worse"
ruh roh get the mustard gramma its a a hot dog in a bun yjummm

i have a pet bunny and this actually made me lol üòÇü§£
i ve got a blue staffy shes or so lbs and months reminds me of her
you get on your damn knees and give that dog some hugs and kisses
nobody can say no when they look at you like that the dog is so beautiful üê∂üíô
i know i‚Äôm supposed to be like ‚Äúaww‚Äù but does that dog have pecs h o w
there‚Äôs a different kind of love between you i fear that‚Äôs illegal
the dog is beautiful but are your hands actually flippers
his eyes are very beautiful the deer is looking for someone in the eye
hello i have gone through evolutionary generations of keep me human i m cute like a baby how do i look
is that a staffy or or a pit bull because my brother has two staffies and i‚Äôm convinced the guilt trip eyes are genetic
oh look the daily pitbull botted upvote post they are still bred for aggression and will attack viciously no matter how well you raise them the funny thing is if you are a pit owner there is chance you are a bad human being and don t raise them well
why are pitts head structure so damn ugly get a golden jesus
what breed is that dog i call it superior dog when i see one but never knew its real name
i applaud your title choice spreading puppy love without the need for pot stirring i like your style
with a face like that he is never going to hear the word no üòÄ
does john wick know you have his dog and do you have a plan for when he finds out
and half of reddit won t get the song reference in your title lol adorable face those eyes
serious question i absolutely love dogs and pitties are adorable but scare me the only reason i can think of is when i was young the people who had them were mean is there any way i can undo that fear
disgusting rat i d blow its head off with my gauge shotgun if i could pitbulls are disgusting violent and the scum of the earth kill them all
very cute a shame this‚Äôll definitely be locked soon
you‚Äôve got a mulcher right there nothing is safe my pit has so far been the most expensive dog i‚Äôve ever had it just wants to shred everything
i don‚Äôt understand the pit bull hate how can anyone look at that face and think ‚Äúyup that‚Äôs a cold blooded killer right there
bruh u posted this twice and both made it onto the front page with k upvotes xd
your two posts on two different subreddit got almost the same amount of updoots nice
dawhhhh i miss my pit so much i want to get a blue nose like this little cutie
nothing better than when a pitty gives you lis look
the anti terrier brigade is real in here strong downvoting any positive comment get fucked you re not changing anyone s mind
i love my chow chow he s an adorable little baby at the same time though he tries to take all the attention away from my german shepherd who s getting older the chow has a strong personality and getting him neutered hasn t helped with his attitude he s only a sweetheart when he s being loved it s actually really difficult to train a dog who is known to be a little shit
my dog gives that face too when i come home she knows cuddle time is coming soon
in tune to puppy love and we then said oh my gaaaawd
oh look at that now thats a killer face am i right fellow dog haters this thing would definitly snatch up a baby because its in his dna not because its made to do that s
so how many children have had their throats ripped out by your pitbull
lol that‚Äôs a pit bull you‚Äôre calling it puppy love now but wait years until it‚Äôs biting children and causing a ruckus just because your dog forms a bond with you only does because you feed it and is nice to you that‚Äôs where it stops it‚Äôs only nice ‚Äî to you ‚Äî not to others this is why most owners cry when pit bulls are put in their place even though they‚Äôre statistically shown as being more aggressive and harming to others
this is too much i cant even look at it for more than a few seconds
lovable and trustworthy animals so cute thank you for sharing
i love how you can sense the level of trust in its eyes like hi i love you unconditionally can we play ball now
oh boy i want a pit now this is a pit right they get such a bad rap but everytime i have been around one where i know the owner they have been nothing but the most loving loyal dogs ever are they good as a second dog what about in large apartments
my pit bull still looks like this at years old that look gets her many walks and snacks
what type of pitbull is this i‚Äôm seeing more and more of these but my pitbull looks nothing like this
this is so cute i m not normally a pit person but they do have lovely interactive faces from some of what i ve seen i love the reflection you can see of his her human in his her eyes just beautiful
do people really have nothing better to do than downvote compliments on a dog breed they dislike
they called it stealing your heart and never giving it back but it‚Äôs safe adorable lil baby
and there go my insides curling up on themselves whenever they see something adorable those eyes man mmmmm
ok i just finished rewatching the john wick movies so i got a bit confused
my cousin has a pit bull he is the most adorable and lovingly dog i‚Äôve ever seen one day we left him at her sister‚Äôs house and when to dinner we came home and the pit bull had disemboweled the sister‚Äôs dog he‚Äôs not left alone anymore true story
all pitbulls are big babies to me i refuse to call them anything else
if you want to see a very precious rescued pittie go see calistathepitbull on ig she is a sweetheart cutie tooters baby hippo seal etc in fact this pic might be her
damn cats living to aren t that rare but they almost always look their age she looks like she could be
what a sweet lil bean she s marking the object with her scent from the look of it i could be wrong but when we were raising foster kitties they would smudge themselves on everything and our adult cat would come through a bit later and reassert it as her own area
moggie appears to be very well feed yes old cats do play at times they are just more deliberate about it
hate to say this fair warning a yo cat with a lease kn life usually means its coming to an end
this is my ball there are many like it but this one is mine
what a lovely girl my old man has arthritis but he still plays sometimes exact the same way as your lady here i love to watch him he s still my b√©b√©
make sure you love her lots as a guy who has had over cats in years the old ones tend to get very young acting as they reach their final years sad but beautiful
my black and white cat plays with tennis balls like this too
i love when old cats suddenly have the need to play like kitties again your cat is so cute and happy doesn t look at all
your cat is older than most of fortnite s community lol
she is adorable i love we get to see the belly and hear her little meows and i had to watch it x because she s too cute does she fall asleep at the end
when you don t stimulate your pet they will not be active havn t in years uuh thats why
my cat l o v e s tennis balls she plays with them just like this
the best toys are always the old smelly ones you find yourself
tennis balls are my cats favorite toy i have a regular and a mini size i think they like that they can grab it with their claws
my old dogs name was moggins and we always called her moggie what a sweet lady you‚Äôve got always a kitten at heart
we ve got a year old gal who could be her twin it s always fun to see them have a burst of kitten
i can t tell if they re just extended because play time or if her rear claws are really long
this is so chill and relaxing if you started a youtube channel with similar videos you d attract some attention imo
cherish her dearly i lost my copy of your cat when he was it was years ago and i m still havent recovered rip lipton
my boyfriend s cat does this with his backpack or their carpet randomly attacks it plays with it exactly like this then runs away in fear weird
i have a stick shaped pillow toy that i use on my cats when they look like they need a good dig when they are flopping around on their backs or going for my feet i grab one of these and run it on their belly and they start going at it like this cat i tug on it and go dig dig dig i have to be careful if they try to reach up for more of it though because the claws are out and they mean business
wow her coat is so luxurious what a beautiful playful kitty üòç
i am a lover of all cats but tuxedo cats are absolutely my favorite i have two luna lovegood and murts they are the quarkiest smartest dumbest cats ive ever known and i get so excited to see their brethren out in the world your old lady is beautiful thanks for sharing
love when they hit their second kittenhoods we picked up a few ping pong balls a few years back as a toy experiment expecting the younger cat to go for it when the older cat now started chasing them maniacally instead we ordered a gross of cheap ping pong balls online poor thing has a blast chasing them then needs time on her heating pad after just like her broken human parents
she‚Äôs so sweeet omg give her so many pets for me please
thank you for the gold u shanereads and thank you everyone else for your kind words glad to see my kitty is getting the appreciation she deserves
i love tuxedo kitties i have a long hair with that exact pattern
got two cats that are both one still plays around similiar to this video the other one hasnt played for maybe years
i don t want to burst your bubble but i had a cat that was over she looked like a kitten she was fed milk from birth but was allergic to it and nobody who owned her realised that s why she was sick so stunted growth and then a lifetime of you can grow up to be a big cat now at the vets followed by shocked expressions but she stopped playing like a kitten years ago the only time she ever did it again was about weeks before she was paralysed by a stroke and we had to put her down in the weeks leading up to it her food habits changed she never really ate anything other than cat meat all of a sudden she was clambering over the dinner plates and even eating chips fries her play behaviour reverted to that of her adolescence she slept much more etc sudden behaviour changes especially in an old cat can be a sign of a kind of dementia you might want to watch her for the next few weeks
my roommate s cat has been more playful than usual all day long maybe something s up like their mothership finally calling or something
wow she looks very healthy for i wouldn‚Äôt even be able to tell
damn she looks great for being whatever you re doing keep it up
unbelievably good looking for a yo babe what a happy healthy lovebug
you might see a bit more activity if she lost a few pounds just sayin
that cat is and still enjoying life clearly her family loves her and took very good care of her our cat died at but at he didn t play like this he just sat around watching tv with me lol
and look at those gorgeous jelly bean toesies she s actually so cute i just wanna nuzzle that fluff tumtum
she looks absolutely amazing for what a rambunctious little floof
look up catnip banana on amazon our elder cat loves it and started to play like this almost everyday again actually when the box came in the mail i had no idea what it was until my cat wouldn t stop attacking the box lol
i thought it said doggie and was really confused for a moment
i can only hope our sweet lola will stay with us years she s coming up on her st birthday soon she is my year old son s best friend kitties are so precious
her fur is so pretty for being years old i bet she gets spoiled with love every day
cats are part solar she had a good charge built up from that sun patch
jesus christ years old i wasnt that energetic even when i was years old
for yo that is an incredibly healthy and well preserved little cat well done
what an absolute chonk what the hell are you feeding it lasagna
my moms lived like twenty three years she was a persian
my cat is also and hardly plays he goes nuts for some dental floss though try it out with moggie don t let her play with it without supervision though
at there s a sound coming from a bird pigeon that sounds like haaeew does anyone know what bird that is i ve been trying to find a video of that sound for years it s hilarious to me
i have a cat that age too sometimes those senior kitizen perk up and get extra playful
my cat is only years old haven t seen her play like this since i had her she is spoiled
well better to destroy others toys than ours at least is what my dog thinks what a cutie surely doesn t look
your kitty looks great for nineteen so healthy and happy
the person who invented velcro probably owned a cat and a tennis ball also that cat loves and trusts her person so completely
she might of found a ball with catnip inside dunno o
awww my kitty started playing with a ball recently he s ish and has some health issues so it makes me so happy to see
aww she looks great my yeah old girl is doing awful everyday we talk about her last day is coming soon but no one can take the step yet
totally agree with everyone here she looks great for good weight eyes are clear and not cloudy and she seems to have decent range of mobility be careful your best feline friend might out live you
omg she s a chunk like my charlie cat they also look identical except for he has a little mustache i would love to take him outside but i live by a busy road one day i want to take him on a leash at least to the park
is moggie her name did you come up with that yourself my last name is moggey all i know is it‚Äôs scottish name
my tuxedos lived to age and one was black and white one was gray and white funny cats those tuxies
i usually don t like stuff with kids but this was really emotional and wholesome
come on stop making me crying in the cafeteria everytime
i m pretty sure this is a repost from less than weeks ago
i wish i had at leas one person as supportive as those people can i get a giant f
i don‚Äôt even mind that this is a repost i think we need more of this kind of love and support in the world and the more people this can inspire to emulate such behavior is all good with me
loved it all except for hipster kung fu master with ‚Äúyou gotta hit it hard‚Äù advice bro
oh man i can t imagine how tough it would have been to watch this as his parent my parents sent me back out there with tears in my eyes too so i know it s necessary for growth i just i just have to prepare myself to do the same with my kids
this is how every group of children should be amazing to see them all support each other
from watching rogan and now having my phone constantly suggest martial arts stuff then watching this i gotta dew it
the first time i did this in tae qwan do i actually thought i missed the board because it felt like i went clean through air i opened my eyes and it was split in two lmao
the absolute most important thing for kids is to learn to get past that first wave of disappointment and carry on so many things in life are not going to come easy and are not going to be bested at your first try to learn to keep going through your tears is invaluable
as a father of boy around that age i desperately wanted this little dude to break that board while i‚Äôm sitting here at work on edge lol
developing bones should not be breaking boards god i hate this fucking practice
this kinda video right here is why reddit is the best
i hear morpheus voice saying come on stop trying to hit me and hit me
what if after all that encouragement and yelling to hit it harder he broke his ankle on the board and it still didn‚Äôt break would have changed him forever
i m having a bad day and this legit brought tears to my eyes
this is why you have to be tough on your kids he almost quit and i am sure if mommy came running out to save the day he would have his coach pushed him because he knew that he could do it and good on the parents for letting him these are the moments that shape our character he will remember this moment his entire life
that actually made me so hype when he broke it awesome post
love the dude in the background doing a random handstand at
this is a total repost your just trying to get karma off this little boy
man and this is a moment that will go with him for life pretty cool
i teach taekwondo and i honestly have to give props to that kid most kids who don t break the board aren t hitting it hard enough because they don t think they can do it and or they re scared to hurt them self as they keep hitting it they just get more and more discouraged and hit it with even less force eventually you just have to crack the board yourself when they make contact and pretend that it was all them also that was a pretty thick board for a kid that young
love the kid that picked him up when he fell for the first time
i hope that this teacher is aware that he contributed to create a better adult
then the next kid does it first time and gets nothing
very sweet video but i think my condo is made of this wood
isn t the board a little to high for the kid to generate max power
any body else oddly attracted to the teacher now because he seems like he would be a hella good dad
life can be great you just need to surround yourself with the right people
you mean gently massaging the board with the sole of the foot wasn t enough to break it
haha the kid doing a handstand in celebration in the back
i just can t relate to anyone being emotional or positive about this at all in my head i m just like fuck you crying for man up and kick it hard or don t and get over it none to cry about
i know i m going to be a part of the minority here while this is a nice video of support it s also an exact portrayal of participation trophies kids get everybody wins the kid had too many failed attempts when i was in karate at years old you had attempts to progress to the next belt if you failed you had to continue training at your current level until the next test you can see the instructor snapping the wood with his hands the moment the kids foot touched it the way his grip and subtle hand movements were i mean the wood is designed to snap easy but the kids foot didnt do it i m just saying that it is nice to teach support for your mates but at the same time its also important to teach kids that not everyone can win and you will sometimes fail at tasks but not to stop you from trying
are kids really like that these days with positive encouragement rather than bullying til you get it right or quit because when i was that age early s it was definitely the latter
looks like the boy couldn‚Äôt believe he actually broke it in the first few seconds
as cute as this is i‚Äôm sorry but all i hear is them chanting ‚Äòpenis‚Äô in the background
this little kid is my hero he pushed through and got a winüôÇüôÇ‚ô•Ô∏èüôÇ
our dog was like that too‚Äîthey said he wasn‚Äôt adoptable but he loves people now and sits on everyone‚Äôs laps as long as they pet him
your doggo is gorgeous i m so happy you rescued her üòç
zero cuddles in pic down voting until cuddle evidence is provided
thank god for people like you who rescue and have patience
we ve had our dog since he was a pup and we don t strike any animal but our dog has become increasingly scared of everything the older he gets we don t know why he didn t used to be so fearful
sup cousin ahahaha weeird seeing someone i know on here
my rescue pupper was the same way now he cuddles with mama all the time athena is absolutely beautiful
your character s name is ian and the show you re on is called shameless but i recall your hair being a bit more red
he looks very scared make sure he sleeps in the same room as you for the first few nights so he knows he won‚Äôt be abandoned again hug the stuffing out of him too
no worries just need him to get off on the right foot my mother did hundreds of rescues so this is where this is coming from good luck üëç
whisper sweet nothings in his silky ears all night has such a good boy
more like who are these humans why are they showing this much attention to me gosh they re staring at me are they gonna eat me why is there a leash in front of me is that going to be used to bind me please help
aw what a sweetie pie congratulations on the new member of your family
the epitome of sad puppy dog eyes there give him lots of kisses and treats
when i see this picture and read the title all i can think of is droopy s voice saying it
for a minute there i thought i was looking at a platypus for some reason heh
the sad eyes will never stop my basset just turned and is living her best life and she still pulls out the eeyore face especially for food she knows she can‚Äôt have love it
please update us once he gets comfortable i would love to see a happy face on this pup d lt
just to clear some things up i am not actually the one adopting this adorable puppy i happened to come across this cutie at a local adoption event taking place at petco he was not purchased from the store it was with an adoption agency i‚Äôm sure he was going to an amazing family so don‚Äôt worry
at night put an old style wind up alarm clock under his blanket the ticking will calm him down
he looks sad and scared make sure this puppy gets all the attention in the world and you are very kind to him
do you americans just go to a walmart and when you want a puppy go to the animal shelf grab a dog from there go to the cashier and pay up s amp x b it s in a shopping cart
hey your the person that took the picture of my dog
i d be looking like that too if i was i had to sit on metal bars
wait do people actually put pets it carts when they get adopted from a store i still have yet to adopt a pet just watch one get born
ah good ol petsmart adoptions the animal equivalent of human trafficking
am i the only one who finds the whole ‚Äúim getting adopted‚Äù with a dog looking scared as fuck just a littttleee bit cringe and sad
i got him at around months old but i imagine this is what my dog louie would have looked like as a pup so cute
i have the same puppy shampoo good luck it‚Äôs a lot of work to stay on top of them for the first couple months but it‚Äôs so worth it in the long run my pup is months old now and he doesn‚Äôt need a leash and listens to everything i say and thank you for adopting and not buying lt
good luck getting pissed at that dude the first time he misbehaves
whenever i see a sad little pupper like this cute guy sometimes i just can t help but let them go
that is a look that can t be resisted happy new home puppy
foh looks like it‚Äôs sad to get adopted ungrateful headass i‚Äôll square up w a mfer on god
that oatmeal shampoo is very good for dogs with dandruff
i mean that s not fair that face is not fair if humans could do that then presidential elections would be determined by sad puppy faces
doesn‚Äòt look too pleased to be adopted by you sorry pal
this dog is so cute how could no one want him before you laid eyes on him
‚Äúhoomans are your bringing me to safety i‚Äôve never known freedom before plws treat me right lt ‚Äù
you love that puppy you appreciate that puppy you adore that puppy and finally you love that puppy
ouch those feet look uncomfy on the cart bars maybe he needs a plush bed
those eyes say ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt let this be a bad joke ‚Äù omg i want to hug this dog so much
pet store dog bred to be sold go to hell op get a rescue dog and stop supporting this shit
looks like you bought him at a pet store why i don t see how people do this when theres thousands of other dogs in shelters
please give us an update in a week or so right now we re getting the kid at the beginning of big daddy i look forward to the i wipe my own ass transformation
why do people put dogs in shopping carts without some padding those paws on the metal bars
god bless you and your new best friend those eyes a keeper good for you
i need a super cute puppy doggo like this in my life
congratulations on your adoption op also nice picture of a dog
you bet your cute little butt you are and you are going to live an amazing life little cutie pit lt
i love how after yesterday s travesty people are just so fucking pumped to shit on op that they forget how to read lol
adopted from a humane society or bought from a pet store adoptdontshop
poor guy looks like he doesn t realize he s going to his forever home
from the pet store or was there a rescued pets event going on
a side note if you buy a puppy from anywhere it can t be called rescue the only time you are rescuing any animal is if they are actually at risk of being put down which puppies are not
he looks sad to be leaving that puppy toy aisle without a basket full of goodies
i think it s great that this lovely pooch decided to adopt you
anyone else remember think he looks like the plastic dog you could dump your spare change into at some cash registers
it looks like he just had a nightmare and is going to his parents to tell them
he looks like those plastic dog piggy banks you used to see at gas stations
i love how scared and sad he looks only because he has no idea how much love he‚Äôs about to receive he doesn‚Äôt know you now but he will come to know you as family i always remember the first time i saw my two cats how terrified they were and how they held each other trying to hide it‚Äôs sweet in a way cuz usually when i remember that they‚Äôre both passed out on my neck and chest purring away or licking my face with their rough spikey tongues
the first thing his hooman buys is what looks like bath stuff
but why in a cart is this inside a pet store if that s the case i hope the little buddy is ok health wise definitely do a vet checkup
he‚Äôs such a droopy eyed droopy earred good little doggyyyyyy
he‚Äôll get everything he wants for the rest of his life
i am very happy to know this guy is going home congrats and i m very happy for you he doesn t look comfortable on that wire grid though the pet store should have provided a flat surface x
that good boy looks a lot like me on my way to work every morning half asleep staring out the window and ignoring the world around me

"‚Äúno dogs on the train‚Äù
‚Äúmy dog identifies as a yr old boy ‚Äù"

right which one of you has been playing with the security card printing machine
hey i work there this is an older picture i can tell by the badge but there are plenty of service dogs here all the time
hopefully they give him more than ‚Äúcharlie work‚Äù to do
i like he is kind of matter of fact happy in his id photo with his ears up but in real life he looks a little pissed you felt the need to check his id that dog has work to do and you shenanigans will not be tolerated
his face though lolol he s looks so annoyed that you re posting his bizness online lol
hard to tell if that s really charlie with the ears down going to have to ask if he wants walkies to get confirmation
looks like a naive upstart vs grizzled veteran timelapse
if you break the rules here he s gonna bork bork nom nom you
charlie will be giving a seminar on how to take a good work photo next tuesday your attendance is encouraged
he looks like he‚Äôs getting carded at the liquor store
oh wait that s not the cat dryer thats the microwave nooooooooo
it s a machine that turns your cat into yoda under seconds
i sincerely hope there‚Äôs a way for the cat to get out without the need for a human i could see nimrods putting their car in here then forgetting about them
note to self do not put cat dryer and microwave in the same room
lays flat and performs stunts like it was skydiving
this cat is like i‚Äôm chilling don‚Äôt talk or look at me lol
we used to have human versions of this at out local swimming pool for minutes of warm air and infared lights literally the most relaxing thing ever
i thought microwaves are not good to dry cats but i was wrong s
i hope this machine doesn t make this sound mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
guys the new easy bake oven looks incredibly versatile
cat dryers just going vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
he can t tell where his fur ends and the air begins
seriously panicked because i thought someone put a cat in a microwave
man why does you cat look so calm mine starts vomiting and clawing when i put it in the microwave
this reminds me of the microwave scene from gremlins get that kitty out if there
mine would lose his shit the second air starts blowing on him we ll need one of those puffy suits they wear when they train police dogs
i can guarantee that both of my cats would be freaking the fuck out if i put them in that thing
why are japanese cats so chill my cats would be freaking out
my cats would eat their way out of that and then eat me for putting them in there
i wish we had had something like this for my arthritic cat he would have loved it so much
i am getting a very project x vibe where matthew broderick has to watch an ape get dosed with radiation behind glass and coax him with a cigarette to unblock radioactive material to halt larger disaster but the ape couldn t have the cigarette because he trapped on the other side and dying of radiation poisoning my god that movie fucked me up
my cat saw this and now he won‚Äôt stop bugging me for one thanks a lot op
people stop crossbreeding cats with goblins oh my god
baset do they worship is still kitty yes mistress they even went as far as creating a cat dryer for our kin baset purrfect üòº
this legitimately put a big smile on my face while having a painful shit and i thank you for that
this reminds of that one movie where an old lady puts her cat in a microwave to dry her off after a shower but then the cat blows up
can u do this with a microwave btw i‚Äôm kidding and don‚Äôt be a moron and try it
a dog died in something like this at a pets mart some years ago the worker forgot about the dog in the dryer after a wash monday‚Äôs amirite
i thought someone was d printing a cat for a second
i wouldn t be surprised if they sleep in there all day
i was kinda scared that he would get his head stuck
he s all seriously hooman this is too easy you ve got to be kitten me

i have been to barentsburg the russian town on svalbard where the cat lives many times and never seen him i haven‚Äôt heard if he is still around
you know when you are playing a video game and they release an expansion that adds a new continent and it just appears on the map out of no where in the middle of the sea i feel like someone just did that to earth there was water there before right how the hell have i gone my entire life never noticing a huge land mass in the middle of the map
that s exactly what a svalbardian cat would look like
i remember in there were at least cats in pyramiden both were of different color there was also a dog man that was a loooong time ago i spent years living there as a kid
i can already hear him speak in ian mckellen s voice
gt only one cat in svalbard is that because he absorbed all the other cats powers like highlander
if someone wished for someone to love them i would secretly make everyone love them instead
he looks like he thinks he drove all the other cats away king of the hill
that s a cat who s owner has a quest for brave adventurers
i always wanna meet that cat my friend from barentsburg always petting him and he s so fluffy lt
looks more like achondroplasia then again i have horrible eyesight and am probably completely quakers
somewhere the inventor of the duck duck goose game is screaming
ugh i‚Äôm so conflicted i hate geese but this is cute i‚Äôm going quackers
goose goose goose goose goose goose goose goose goose duck goose goose goose goose
when do the adult geese start teaching their young to be assholes
there are certain ducks that will purposely lay their eggs in other birds nest for them to raise
might be a weird question op but is this beaverton or
i like how half of the animal kingdom will eat kill other species young but the other half is just like eh it s close enough
oh my gosh this made me smile so wide and i dont even like geese they stick to high heaven but this video reminds me of beautiful human families
so what happens to the duck when they all decide to migrate
i love this canada goose goslings sometimes from ‚Äúgang broods ‚Äù these can include sometimes five or more families of goslings that travel feed and loaf together accompanied by at least one adult kinda like day care
come along now children we‚Äôre going to the park to harass the elderly
i want to watch them grow up together and i want to see the pixar movie inspired by the story
a duckling adopted me once followed me home and sat in my lap in my front yard it was one of the best days of my life
i like this it reminds me of when i was young and on my soon to be step dad s farm when a raccoon killed his duck and eggs but missed one egg my step dad put the duck egg in the incubator with a bunch of chicken eggs and soon misfit came out the duck that thought he was a chicken he hung with chickens pecked around for food and was scared shitless of water even when new ducks came back misfit wouldn t hang out with them he was a chicken it was very cute and hilarious at least this duck has an adopted family that likes water
well now we know who s going to grow up with a shitty attitude and inferiority complex
man i‚Äôm glad i don‚Äôt work at my former job there were geese absolutely everywhere on campus they are without a doubt nature‚Äôs meanest animal
well what do you know not all candageese are assholes
one feels like a duck splashing around in all this wet
looks like a younger canada goose gosling not a duckling its not uncommon for a dominant pair of parents to steal goslings from another pair of parents perhaps the dominant pair of parents think the less dominant parents were getting too close to their goslings so they run them off and end up with some of their goslings also fairly common to see parent groups with a melded group of goslings
when i was a kid we had chickens we lived just outside of los angeles and they were kept in a coop in our backyard one time my dad found an abandoned baby duckling and brought it home it was tiny and the chicks just accepted it as their own he eventually just blended right in with the other chickens eating their food with them and sleeping next to them the chickens never seemed to notice his differences either one day my mom went out to feed them and as usual they all came running they did the typical morning dash pecking at each other and flapping their wings in the mad scramble to get to the food first the duck was last out of the coop and started running and flapping so hard that he flew right over the chickens it was like watching forrest gump realize that he didn t need his magic legs after all i m sure he was just as surprised as all of us including the chickens unfortunately he also flew over the fence and then the neighbors house and eventually out of sight farewell howard wherever you are
animals seem to know when another animal is a child my sister adopted a kitten that had been separated from its family her adult cat saw him and was like ‚Äòok this is my son now ‚Äô he carries him around in his mouth and watches over him when he sleeps it‚Äôs so sweet
y all i m not an expert but isn t that just a smaller goose like from another brood
one of these things is not like the other one of these things does not belong
i used to live by a reservoir and there were many geese they seemed to like being in a flock unless babies were involved then the mating pairs would literally fight other parents and steal their babies this goose couple looks like they‚Äôve been stealing other clutches and the one duckling they‚Äôre like ‚Äúthis one too for good measure‚Äù tldr this is probably a case of duck napping
but when they all migrate one family member won‚Äôt be able to keep up
weird question but if that duckling were to grow up thinking it is a goose would it try to mate with geese thinking that it is a goose
me trying to fit in with the boys in a mixed sports team
what happens when they can all learn to fly and he can t zubsaaaaaad
me and my boyfriend saw something just like this the other day a bunch of geese and like a small yellow baby bird i want to say duck but i cant confirm it was like a whole pack of them and the suspected duck like tripped and rolled down the hill it was very cute
i was on holiday in morocco where the hotel s resident peacock had adopted a chick into her flock of babies so cute
i love goslings an unreasonable amount i see them near my job all the time they‚Äôre so cute
possibly or it s a newer gos either way pretty adorbs
the one time geese aren t royal assholes at long last they are being loving
i love how they re all walking in a line with a grownup at each end just like daycare kids
when you don t pay attention during a field trip and wind up with the wrong tour group
notallgeese they re dicks but sometimes they will take in a foster duck even when they already have a bunch of kids
that is not a duckling that is a baby goose from a different clutch of eggs
so i think that is also a gosling just much younger geese tend to form family groups and will care for other goslings this gosling likely got separated from their actual parents so followed some new ones instead unfortunately the larger babies will be able to fledge sooner and may leave the little one behind when they are able to fly away
isn t this literally the premise of the ugly duckling
those geese are mean most of the time but when they have goslings they are downright evil
that s actually not that uncommon in fact if you find a stray duckling animal control will advise you to try to take it near another duck or goose and to try to get them to take it in
you got a problem with canadain gooses you got a problem with me and i suggest you let that one¬†marinate
ducks will totally follow geese around i used to have two ducklings myself and we used to have geese come to our a pond every year every time as soon as the geese showed up the ducks wouldn t follow us around anymore they would only follow the geese
man i was driving on the high way and a pair ducks or goose with their babies crossed the entrance it was insane almost got into an accident
looks like a kindergarten class on a walk with the teachers on the front and back üòÖ
i‚Äôm gonna have to blame our half baked tom turkey here the first chicken egg hatched on mother‚Äôs day and the rest of the batch on fathers day poor me for being left to sort out the bad eggs
you see this this is good learn from this stupid humans
i ve seen adult geese with goslings here co and looked it up geese do gather their kids together for safety and some parents don t so much adopt although they will as steal kids
if you got a problem with canada gooses then you got a problem with me and i suggest you let that marinate
i hope that duckling grows up to be a big boy or girl with the same come at me bro attitude that geese can have
there turning ducks against one another damn fucking geese general quackins begin defcon
while i do love this post and the fact that the adult geese accept this little baby as their own i wonder what will happen when it s time to migrate and it s time for the duck to find a mate if anyone has a good educated answer please tell me i don t want it to be lonely
you ever notice when how there s always canada gooses flying overhead when there s a fire they re flapping water in it no one calls them heroes
whebever i see geese walk i hear the goose music from aristocats
of course they did geese and ducks use a nanny system and watch the collected pack of juveniles of the area the pond near my house has a more evenly mixed group of geese and ducks
maybe its one of the geeses guests on a family vacation
now i wanna know if geese are known to adopt other aquatic birds or is this just a one off
the geese alone have such a large clutch even without the duck i ve never seen a clutch that large before good on mom and dad for keeping them all alive
that‚Äôs just a smaller gosling a duckling would be even smaller than that
that will eventually be the meanest duck on the block
smart duck the geese are bodyguards you don t fuck with canada geese
curtis stand up straight you look like a god damned duck
how do geese and ducks know that they have all of their children they can t count
after raising some ducks and geese as a kid i learned that most of those chicks are actually kidnapped the dominant pair ends up taking all the babies
oh my god i saw this group of geese the other day they were almost hit by some assholes though like another food and they d be dead
used to have some turkeys around and one of the babies lost it s siblings and mother it was raised by one of the hens and even the roosters were mellow toward it
geese do baby collect they aren‚Äôt great at keeping track of the number of babies they have so there tend to be an occasional mix up and they can have a much younger goose baby from another family in the mix i think it may just be a lil goose bean üòä
that‚Äôs the sweetest thing i‚Äôve seen on a long time ‚ù§Ô∏è
one is not like the other just can‚Äôt put my finger on it
my mom has three cats exactly like this her ruff cat is species confused ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è climbs the cat tree just like the rest

my mom was convinced i let one of our indoor cats escape outside when i was a teenager she was so angry my dad went driving around for hours looking for him he was sleeping behind the entertainment center this was years ago when big screen tvs weren t flat so this thing was massive it was a great hiding spot
‚Äúlost‚Äù my fianc√©‚Äôs cat behind the microwave one time was a counter one and we had angled it into a corner where the counter meets she‚Äôd never hidden there before and i came home from work and couldn‚Äôt find her she was his baby and i didn‚Äôt think she‚Äôd escaped into our condo‚Äôs hallway but i had literally trashed our place looking for her by the time he came home he called her name and out she pranced all happy to see him she hated me so much didn‚Äôt matter i had called her name for hours prior ‚Äô

my summer camp had two bunnies and near the beginning of the summer they had babies and every once in a while they would have an activity where you would go to the shack where they were and pet the bunnies all over there bodies to train them not to freak out when petted as adults possibly the cutest thing i have ever witnessed when you flipped them upside down to rub their bellies they would fall asleep
very cute lifted my mood after i got caughr with gram weed on my class trip good picture
if aliens looked like this we would happily give up earth to them

aww hi hunny bun üòõ if i don t get a pomerian in the future a bunny sounds like a great pet to me i d just need a whole bunch of allergy meds every day i have owned a bunny a long time ago but i actually love owning a dog i actually have two dogs and i wouldn t trade them for any other pet the german shepherd that i have right now is actually getting older and its sad to see that your pet is usually the one who sits with you and watches you grow through life a companion that walks the path with you so you don t feel alone that s why they call them man s best friend imo
i ve seen this pic weeks ago where d you get it from dude
ugh i hate seeing people hold them this way you gotta support their butts or you risk breaking their backs

syfy would be interested in yall s talent and sound effect artists this is golden
how is this not a more popular post i also don‚Äôt laugh out loud often but this got me good
oh i m so gonna do that to my girlfriend might need to move afterwards worth it
for the life of me i can t figure out why snoring was never evolved out of the gene pool like how is making noise while you re asleep not an evolutionary disadvantage
poor genetically modified animal struggling with breathing not funny
sounds like a midget on the toilet after binging on taco bell
dude this is brilliant xd wish my husband was this cute when he snores
sounds like my alarm clock every morning my dad ripping ass in my bedroom was my alarm clock up until i graduated
low key was hoping for a beat to drop from that mic
i would like to make a request that somebody sample this and put it to a beat
thank god this was posted again i saved the post originally but it wasn t saved right and was super disappointed this shit is gold
please tell me this is how they get the noises for some dinosaurs in jurassic world this is awesome
good god i hope this becomes a trend i cannot stop giggling üòÇüòÇüòÇ
i don t want to concern you but i think your cat may be a clanger
what is this thing called like is it a special microphone or something
someone please sample this and make it into a dreampop cloudrap tune
how they weren t dieing of more laughter in this video is amazing this is so amusing too
can‚Äôt decide it that‚Äôs a pokemon noise or a weird fart
came for the snores stayed for the stifled laughter wish i could remix
this is the best i‚Äôve literally watched this a hundred times and i can‚Äôt stop cry laughing
flat faced cats like this can have breathing problems similar to short muzzle dogs like pugs and bulldogs
lol how did the cat sleep through that that‚Äôs hilarious üòÇ
thank you so much you have no idea what you‚Äôve done for me
this better become a thing please reddit make this a thing
wow what a legend this world is much better with this video
op you have bestowed a gift upon the universe by posting this
this is what happens when you bread creatures to have smaller and smaller noses
yeah it s cute it s also unable to breathe properly due to extreme selective breeding i d be willing to sacrifice the odd cute video if it meant more animals were allowed basic functionality but maybe that s just me
it s because his face is all fucked up presumably for the same reason pug faces get fucked up
my cat snores like a hissing snake very high pitched he even squeaks sometimes like a mouse whistling
our cat duck snores just like this even louder she was a feral cat that grew to trust us she is now chipped and spayed and living the good life inside i think she snores like that because she never got good deep sleep outside i am sure that isn‚Äôt the case but it‚Äôs a nice thought
this is the funniest thing i ve seen on reddit i can t stop
this insignificant video has made the best impact on my day god bless the internet
hellloooooo i m a caaaa aaaaat im an idiot your an idiot
it sounds exactly like that old english tv show the clangers

i wanna see what fiona the hippo looks like now lol
hippo tried to eat my aunt then a different hippo tried to eat my uncle moral is i don t really trust hippos
am baby hippo in a pool is keeping me so nice n cool no kitten soft or puppy see but them babes ain t as hip as me cuz me i have a funny game it shares my hungry hungry name no matter how we may appear we all just little babes so dear
looks like me in a swimming pool but i don t look that cute
it doesn‚Äôt have a double chin it has an infinity chin
i thought someone had gotten a hold of a picture of me at first
and not just any hippo but fiona the hippo she was born two months premature at the cincinnati zoo and only weighed pounds or kg at birth normal weight is lbs or kg and was expected to die through a lot of hard work and dedication even the cincinnati children s hospital had to help by putting her on oxygen to survive fiona survived and is now a happy healthy hippo
awards for a f cking hippo i could ve just called my mom for y all
i like hippo s they re cute and look very cuddly especially the little ones why do they grow tusks for teeth though

i can just imagine the baby hippo going hewwo may i have some leaves
she is a hungry hungry hippo best give her all the treats
i wonder what it is like to give head scratches to baby hippo also would boop that snoot

found out this week that hippos lived all over the uk during the last global warming their fossils can be found in trafalgar square
okay i know i have gained a little weight but could you not take pictures of me in the tub and post them online saying i am a baby hippo
hippos are extremely dangerous fiona looks ready to kill a man
i bet you she loves neck rubs those rolls are asking for tlc
i thought at first he got a health bar in the top left
if we call rhinos tanks snakes are danger noodles etc then hippos should be called lake river submarines and therefore fiona is a submarine calf or puppy
something is wrong with this cat why is it so moist
i love fiona i watch her youtube videos and all the hard work that went into keeping her alive was inspiring to see i can t wait until the day i can go see her in real life
i first read as a hippy bimbo that s actually what caught my attention
they are not cute they killed several member of the high royal family of the hahahah bdctrust motherfuckers yeah murderous never trust him please god never do it or saw ‚Äúthe past for seven lakesÔøº
too bad they grow up to be murderous bastards they re so cute when they re too small to crush you to death or slash you to death with their razor sharp tusks in terms of human deaths caused hippos are the most deadly large animal on earth and they do it on purpose they re aggressive and chase down humans when they get a chance
could still probably bite off your fingers if she wanted to üòÇ
i m always sad that baby hippos grow up to be ill tempered adult hippos but there s always adult rhinos who are one horn doggos
‚Äúbaby hippos look like shiny poops ‚Äù my daughter years
at what age does this hippo become the murderous beast that annually kills more people in africa than any other creature
hi op thanks for a picture of baby fiona that i hadn t seen before
that looks like one and only uncle fatty stugotzarmy
i‚Äôd love to see him smile and show those beautiful white cylindrical teeth

no wonder hippo mothers are fierce about protecting them they re precious
can t fool me i know a grey bullfrog when i see one
when you hop out the shower fresh with no makeup on and bae still thinks you cute

where are the scienties at i need to order one of these as a mini lbs max
that thing could grow to be the size of delaware it could eat brains and fart space aids
soon to be full size shit spraying terrifying man eating beast
i‚Äôll never understand why people spend money to give platinum to a photo of a hippo
look at that guy that guy right there is a fella if i ever saw one
crazy to think this little cutie will grow into a killing machine
if only we could own miniature elephants and miniature hippos china needs to make it happen i hear they have human pig hybrids give us exotic pets dammit
good thing the democrats didn t get a chance to abort it
are hippo‚Äôs necks usually that pink i that area is it it just cause she‚Äôs leaning on the wall of that tub
what the fuck is he doing in a human tub this is a wild creature and should be in the wild
so cute until she eats someone and rips people apart
cute now but when she grows up she ll become one of the most dangerous land animals on the planet
that chin if only i looked as fabulous with a double chin

i love fiona so much i wish i got to see her when she was still so tiny i‚Äôm still going to call her baby fiona even though she‚Äôs not much of a baby anymore

i can just imagine her saying what s up homies in a very cheerful voice
closeallzoos stop animal theft from africa asia and south america
funny how they are so cute at this age and grow into some of the most fearsome beasts on the planet
looks strikingly similiar to the guy in the looking glass
awww so cute how it will grow into a murderous tank ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
hi everyone this is the skull of a full grown hippo
i just love baby hippos especially fiona i ve been following her story for awhile now she s not a baby anymore but she still is so cute
hippos look cute and friendly but they will fuck you up if you get near one üòù
straight facts that‚Äôs a younger than average hippopotamus right there
this is why i didn‚Äôt wanna kill no hippos in assassins creed
i miss this fiona she brought me a lot of happiness in her videos
how can you tell its a baby maybe its just a big plastic tub
look forward to watching her grow into a vicious killing machine
so cute for one of the deadliest animals on the planet
this hippo will grow up to be violent and territorial hippos account for the majority of deaths by animal attack exceeding every other animal combined they re vicious and will give chase to a boat before crushing a hole with a bit force of lbs of force per square inch this bite force is especially deadly because a hippo can open it s mouth degrees meaning it can take a bite out of basically anything hippos being herbivores have no need to kill things they kill things just because they are violent by nature a not uncommon event is a hippo biting crocodiles in half
it looks so non threatening too bad hippos aren t actually that way
this is my favorite girl lt fiona is our little hippo celebrity lots of fun to see her at the zoo
so cute before they become monsters capable of literally biting a man in half very cute
that has to be the cutest dog i have seen in a long time
i got a silly question hippos are known as one of the most dangerous and aggressive animals in the wild if they are socialised with humans since they re babies like the one in this picture would they remain friendly throughout adulthood anyone have any experiences like that
i m certain that if i hugged this hippo i wouldn t need another hug the rest of my life
we do love our not such a baby anymore fiona here in cincinnati my husband and i have had zoo personnel talk to us about her when we ve gone to other zoos around the country it s pretty cool
cincinnati zoo if you can‚Äôt handle us at our harambe you don‚Äôt deserve us at our fiona
i joke all the time about how our mo old rescue puppy would eat your face off just as soon take a poop or where is that evil dog you can t turn your back on that animal he will eat you and then spit you out and then eat you again now we all know that cute little puppies are not going to ever eat your face off and then puke it back up and then eat it again but when it comes to hippos that animal is a cute little pile of squish and floof that will no doubt later in life swollow you whole i am uber impressed with hippos they are fascinating animals and when you tell people that hippos are on the top of the list for killing humans it is almost unbelievable look at that cute little hippo dont turn your back he will eat you whole great pic
woot an animal that has more chins than me selfesteem
can can i have it i have a huge bathtub and everything
i live in ohio and haven t had the pleasure fof seeing this baby what have i been doing wrong with my life
adorable now but when she grows up she ll murder you
huh i coulda sworn that was a picture of my cousin todd
aww look at the cute lav ready to begin murdering everything it wants
this solidifies the fact that i want a hippopotamus for christmas
that‚Äôs dan lebetard how many times do i have to teach you this lesson old man
okay fiona as her name works of course but i think she d make a great penelope too lt
wish i could cutely rock the double chin like she does
but seriously never trust a hippo those things are evil
how can i get my own baby hippo i only want to play with it for x months years and will gladly donate to a loving zoo once it s grown to murderous proportions
really i thought it was a rhino that poachers remove the horn
why does this little thing look so smug why i will totally pet and aww at it üòç
i‚Äôve seen one viciously attack its handler i wonder if it‚Äôs the same one
oh yeab ooh ahh that s how it always starts then later there s running and screaming
this actually looks like a karen that everyone knows at work
hi everyone this is the second most dangerous animal in the world
i see you found a north american house hippo in your cereal bowl
"step awwwwww step upvote
step save post
step protecc
step mooooooom i wanna baby hippo"
and to think this thing will grow into a giant beast
i know it s hard but you better kill it now you re not going to get another chance
hippos kill more people than all wild life annually
baby hippo doo dooo dooo doo dooo dooo dooo dooo dooo dooo
note if you see this in the wild run cause momma about to knock yo down
hippos are wild animals and they are dangerous they‚Äôre not pets
annnnnd now i want a potbellied hippo of my very own
that‚Äôs fiona i live in cincinnati so i can see her anytime
crazy to think hippos are the deadliest animals in africa
looks like she s got a full health bar up the top left
i give it a week and that cat is gonna be sleeping on doggos head
did you just hold the cat tight so your dog could lick it perhaps i m too soft but the way a lot of redditors handle their pet seems a bit odd
mmmm tastes good wait i have to share my food and bed nooowwoooowooouuu
how cute they re best friends already my dog and cat became friends instantly too cat is way younger and smaller and they sleep on the same bed
dog people him rolling over on his back is him showing the kitten he is not a threat
cats hate having things approach their face like that try to get your dog to not do it
what kind of dog do you have looks very similar to my hound mix
i really thought the dog would slap the kitten not gonna lie
why is it my dog only wants to murder kittens basenji
tfw the kitten cuteness is too much and you collapse
i swear the dog was trying to make a heart with his paws lmao
"doggies usually
reflect their owner what
a good job this owner has done"
someone just made a bff cutest post on reddit today thanks for posting technicolorbeaches
that dog is utterly collapsing from the cuteness he can‚Äôt take it
awww it showed its belly which is a sign of trust ü•∞
what good boy i think that cat is a lucky little girl
i was told to never hold an animal like you are holding the kitten in a meet it should be in a cage and the dog should be allowed to sniff
kinda like when you lick icecream before you bite its head off
i can‚Äôt be the only one who has to see more of these two please
your dog does an excellent job of having a freckly belly
i wish my dog and cat got along like that very awesome to see
well the fluffy razor blade is now the alpha of the family
so adorable hope he doesn t mind when kitty gets spunky later
for anyone worrying about the handling of this kitten this person is getting up every hours to bottle feed it and wipe its ass so worry less maybe
gentle or not that kitty looked like his head was thrown around when that dog licked him too young for that not a cute video
we had a siamese cat once and a daschund wiener dog the cat had about kittens but she was a roamer so she left for abit and our daschund went and was laying with the kittens and looking after them in the cupboard all sweetly so we left and went to the mall and when we got back she had killed and dragged every single one of them across the carpet and left them scattered around the room blood everywhere i was about at the time and god i fucking hate those penis dogs but anyway just watch out you should probably only let them be alone together when the kit is old enough to run away if need be
as cute as this is that is a pretty bad way to introduce them holding the cat like that so it can t move while letting the dog do whatever he wants to it
that kitten is very young its ear folds are still down poor mite
i absolutely love this you and your bff go girl üíï props to the parents just letting her live her best life
well she s gonna freak out when she learns whats inside of her
just wait until she finds out that skeletons are dead people
my cousin‚Äôs daughter loves skeletons amp x b have those words ever been said in the history of mankind
i spot a future medical examiner or coroner or mortician
and i thought my niece was a bit strange for loving dinosaurs d
going to need an update on this girl in ish years seems like a serial killer
i saw a pic of a child putting makeup on a skeleton same child
wow when i was that young i was afraid of skeletons she‚Äôs very brave lol üòÇ
i got a skull piggy bank around age five or six and i still have it i decided back then that i was going to be a forensic anthropologist i am not
so does that mean she has some skeletons in her closet
i d be concerned about bones pushing her toward anorexia
grim fandango is another game that may be of interest to her
when i was about her age i used to play hide and seek in my mortician dad‚Äôs casket room i appreciate her total chill with spooky as a fellow spooky child
she looks exactly like my cousin‚Äôs daughter who is being raised as a redneck by parents who don‚Äôt have a single nerd bone in their bodies
has she seen nightmare before christmas i think around age or so she‚Äôs gonna have a huge crush on jack skellington
i guess this is the equivalent of liking snakes when the world thinks those are scary just taken up about notches
a future osteologist buy her a dk skeleton book now
this is awesome i can only hope my child is this cool
i wanted a scale model skeleton when i was that age unfortunately this was in the s and kitchy halloween stuff wasn t as elaborate as it is now the only thing on the market was medical models which were out of our price range now i m a bitter and jealous old man
ohhh his little face looks so velvety and i literally have tears in my eyes üò≠
great now i have to drive all the way home for lunch and hug my dog
this is the most high definition pup i ever did see
is this a specific type of pitbull when i google image search pitbull i get vastly different results
i don t know he looks like he is up to something like a steamer he left in the bedroom on the window side of the bed where you hardly ever look
people who say pitbulls are bad dogs haven t met my half husky half greyhound
he is carrying a very regal air about him he must have some blue blood in him sir something or a lord something
good thing this guy keeps his little dog outside never thought i would say that aloud
momma dog starts to get anxious the closer the camera gets looks like she starts doing a roll call
that quick peek the tiny kitten does before it goes back to sleep on its mom kills me
i always see some crazy news about bad stuff then i see this good news about happy stuff this isn t quite enough to offset the bad stuff but it s a good start stuff
not that weird imo every animal including us shares a common ancestor if you go back far enough in this case it s a wolf
its incredible completely different species can share a sqf space while some humans have a hard time sharing a fucking planet because of skin color
well for this first time on this sub i m happy to say this made me awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
right up there with public housing and a better story that twilight
it blew his mind that a cat selfishly annexed living space never owned a cat then
if it s really cold out the owner should hang a thick curtain over the door
i upvotes this post from to and it was a great feeling almost as good as seeing an upvote go from to find it in your heart
ok i m confused if my dog had puppies i certainly wouldn t leave her outside with them dog house or otherwise it s nice that the homeless kitty has a place to keep her kittens safer but still i d have them all come inside
animals being more humane than the apex species that controls the planet
here s a question why is this guy keeping his dog and her puppies out in the rain in the first place
thank you fellow redditor for my first reddit gold whoever you are üôÇ
"will you stop pushing the
camera in their faces i have no words"
that s the cutest shit ever but i could do without the dramatic drawn out subtitled storyline kind of feels fake and or just cheesy when you make a viral video of some animals bonding just show us the cuteness you don t need to spice it up with a slow unnecessarily long story
you know the dog was there first if it was the other way around
easy question can the pups drink from the car and vice versa
more proof dogs are better than cats if the shoe was on the other paw things would be a little different
my father used to own a german shepherd and the dog was eating when a cat came to eat with the dog ironically the dog ended up eating the cat
guy has pregnant dog and leaves it and its puppies in the fucking garden that s the headline
i‚Äôd be afraid with all the animals in there isn‚Äôt there a chance of some of the babies suffocating
wait are cats now domesticating themselves with other animals
that might be the cuddly est thing ever would pet the good girls
pro tip use straw instead of fabric to keep outdoor animals warm blankets absorb moisture and laying on wet fabric can actually cause the animal to lose even more heat straw doesn t absorb water but is a great insulator to keep animals toasty
adorable glad you found a good solution for your baby‚ù§Ô∏è
this is a genius idea definitely passing this along to my coworker whose pup is getting spayed this week
there are also special dog onesies in case you need a different size my dog absolutely hated his cone but he was completely fine with the onesie only cost about bucks it‚Äôs washable and reusable and he looks fucking cute in it i‚Äôm talking like constant awwing from me cute
thank you for spaying and for finding a way to keep her happy
thanks all it‚Äôs seriously been a lifesaver she still has to wear the dreaded cone while we sleep but as soon as i get up in the morning and grab the swimsuit she gets so excited she even helps lift bend to get it on quickly now
be careful she doesn t chew at the wound through the bathing suit my dog was awful for this after being spayed she would also use her back legs to kick at the wound obviously was very itchy i was basically on itchy patrol for a few weeks
aww i used to do this on my dog when he had sore paws infant and baby socks were perfect
is your dog pure bred lab or mix she looks just like my sweet girl who is mixed with something but we are unsure what
when we got one of our dogs fixed and put the cone on him he stood motionless for like minutes before we had to poke him in the butt to show him he was able to walk
they didn t give us a cone at the local humane society and i ve been having to correct her to get her to stop licking it s making me stupid anxious all the time and i can t wait until she can freely lick herself without me bursting in to get her to stop more days
that s sort of like a thundershirt you can get for dogs that makes them feel safer it s just a snug elastic romper just like that
if that isn t the cutest thing in the world i don t know what is
we did this with my dog when she was spayed except we used an old oversized t shirt she wore the sleeves on her front legs and the back was tied up with a hair tie the hardest part about the whole thing was keeping her from running while the stitches were in
speedy recovery my boy is laying across my leg recovering he went in tuesday wants to be normal and not rest of course
this should go to market may need to have it tested in the lab first
we did something similar when our pup was neutered using a pair of our our son‚Äôs underwear we would take them off when he went out to do his business but they stayed on all the time inside worked perfectly
awwww poor baby sending her lots of virtual scritches and scratches hope she feels better soon
gt traded it for one of my daughters old bathing suits and she is so much happier and her incision is still protected amp x b and she looks fabulous
this is awesome shiner had acl surgery last year and could slip out of that cone of shame without thinking about it i tried differnt ones we ended up having to drug for weeks she basically spent the whole weeks drugged and asleep but she turned out ok
it was a baby onesie for our younger dog he has a super long neck but was teeny so the size that fit his neck he could get around it to the incision but the next size up he could walk through so we improvised lol
just make sure she doesn t chew on the outside of the bathing suit her teeth will do damage to the incision through that suit
i don t get why they don t do this everywhere but my vet sells a bitterant that you dab a bit of around the site of the wound and they try once and hate it some animals you need to re apply but for our cat we did not much better than a cone so glad my vet does that did not want to see our kitty in a cone
except she can still get to them and bite at them through the suit
looks like she s ready for a summer beach excursion
lots of concerned people out there but no worries we‚Äôre safe about it and i did speak with the vet before we did this she has never once scratched at her incision nor does she wear the swimsuit when i‚Äôm gone or overnight the cone goes back on then for us it‚Äôs worked great
ahhh what a cutie my cat is a bigger fella and he had a wound that needed covered we used a babies onesie on him his kneck was too thick for the cone of shame he was much more comfortable that way
i like how your daughters old bathing suit and her collar look great together so happy that she is happier now üê∂üåàüíô
this is great my dog hated her cone when she was spayed she stays in her crate during the day when i m at work and i came home every day for straight days to a completely destroyed cone that was just ripped to shreds and then would have to go buy a new one i spent like on frickin cones after that i had a day off so i watched her without the cone and she did not give two hecks about her incision or her stitches never tried to chew them or lick them at all after that i just didn t put anything on her and she was completely fine best dog i ve ever had
so cute and practical but do you take it off when she needs to go to the bathroom
this reminds me of the time that i put my cat genevieve who has now gone over the rainbow bridge in a baby onsie to prevent her from scratching haha didn t work at all because she just flopped over and wouldn t move so we put a bandana around her instead and she wore that like it was made of gold for like a year ahhh miss that sassy girl
aww poor baby hopefully all goes well and she heals quickly amp x b our dog rudy was neutered a couple months ago and hated the cone as well he managed to get his first one off of him and chewed to pieces within the first week he was not amused when i got him a brand new one the very next day
when my sister s dog got spayed my mom altered a pair of panties for her to wear it was adorable and my mom got to play with her sewing machine
i remember my dog in his cone of shame after a neighbors dog bit him half our fault he was off his leash but just wanted to play the other dog did not anyways he stood all night unmoving staring at us probably thinking about murder again all night he stood staring i woke up throughout the night for whatever reason
my old dog didn t really care about having a cone on in general but he always misjudged doorways with it on he d bump into the frame stop bump into again stop stare for a second then bump into it a third time he always looked super calm until the third bump then he fuckin lost it and starting trying to fight the cone out of rage
i love this a cone isn t the end of the world but the human could see doggo was unhappy then they problem solved and spent time making sure this was a better solution that s lovely
i wish i had thought of that my dog despised the cone as well
we used baby onesies for our pup she‚Äôs a cocker spaniel so considerably tinier you put them on backwards and just leave the bottom flap open around the neck the weird neck hole let‚Äôs the arms flex to fit the back legs
this is actually super genius i wish i had something like this for my babies when they got fixed or had an idea as genius as this my cat kept licking at her incisions and i had to watch her like a hawk for a week to make sure she didn t rip them open
not to mention she looks both fashionable and ready for summer
now you tell me neutered spayed dogs after each with the cone or shame or some expensive flimsy vet suit this is amazing show this to anyone involved with dog rescue
so cute if you ever need a cone after all they also make these inflatable donuts that go around the dog‚Äôs neck and keep them from biting it looks like a travel pillow my pup hated the cone but was fine with the pillow
until if runs off and shits somewhere that ll be a mess
looks just like my black lab bella ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è hope she heals quickly and greatly what a cute doggo
i went and bought one of the in flatable donuts that replaces the cone my pitbull destroyed it and her collar to get the thing off so we found her old storm shirt and put that on and she was happy as can be we had to buy a second one so that we could wash the first one as she refused to let us take it off of her and would go pout if we didnt put it right back on shes weird it doesnt help her anxiety but she likes to wear it
lmfao my daughter has that bathing suite it s her favorite one
i have smaller dogs and used a onesie for a month old protected her from the other dog trying to lick her incision too it was nice but i‚Äôm sure it could be sewn in a way to leave openings for doing their business surely someone has already figured this pattern out i just couldn‚Äôt find it
i would pay money for a video of you putting this on your dog i bet that was a hilarious minutes
my vet hates cones of shame she always says to try clothes over it first
amazon sells something called a suitical recovery suit for dogs after surgery i bought one for my pup when she was spayed worked great much more comfortable then the cone looks like a onesie with a turtle neck they also have soft cones as well this is a great alternative i tried to use a actually baby onesie but it did not fit her correctly which prevented it from working
oh my god this is an invention that will save doggos everywhere from evil cones
yeah my mastiff refuses to use a cone i cut a tail hole in some basketball shorts and they worked perfectly he also looked like he could ball hard so that was cool
our dog had a surgery weeks ago and hated his cone vet said to put a t shirt on him instead and it would be fine husband and i went to dinner six nights after his surgery he chewed through his t shirt and pulled out all stitches on a sunday night emergency vet tried to charge us more than to stitch it back up even after declining some of the services like a blood test which we‚Äôd just done during his surgery i wound up having them bandage it up really well still and went to our real vet first thing in the morning and they fixed it up for moral of the story‚Äî keep an eye on baiting suit dog
she can still bite it through the fabric gt gt there s a reason we put cones on dogs their teeth are sharp
do you know it is better for the wound to be exposed and by the way that swimsuit is easy to break or even easy to scratch the wound even with it look out
for smaller dogs and cats onesies are great for this
it even kind of matches her collar what a fancy girl
but won t your daughter be upset about having to go swimming in a cone of shame and no bathing suit
i almost did this with my girl after her surgery this past week but she‚Äôs pounds and i had no clue what size clothes to get for her and instead ended up having to buy cones since she got the first off and now the second one is duct taped together it‚Äôs been a rough few days hoping a quick and easy recovery for your girl
i would say win win win since you also get so see a dog in a bathsuit
i used an inflatable collar when i got my guy neutered and he didnt care that he had to wear it
i dunno my mutt would chew through that stuff in one hot second
for our chihuahua we used a baby onesie from meijer did the same thing and looked adorable
i done the same put on toddler knickers worked perfectly i cut a hole in for the tail
the doorbell rings i gotta get them inside in my best little girls voice i m like hi come on in i m putting on my bikini
i guess it doesn t cover her bum hole and make it hard for her to poop
look into laparoscopic spay if you can to everyone who will get their dog spayed in the future we did it for our hunting dog and she was only in pain for the actual day of the surgery after days she was back to going up stairs and running and after she was wrestling with other dogs again it‚Äôs a tiny hole instead of the whole abdominal incision
right on man it really is just whatever works and is least stressful to your fur friend
i bought my dog one of those dog onesies at the vet instead of the cone of shame and he ate through it and then i reinforced it and he ate through it again i guess he really wanted that cone of shame then his incision got infected from him doing that silly boy your dog is adorable by the way
my dog had a really intense neuter his balls were retractable and it took two big incisions to find them and he looked so sad in his cone so i put him in my daughter‚Äôs old acro outfit he looked like he was ready to teach a jazzercise class
curious to know how old she is my dog needs to spayed as well
serious she really can t get at her sutures through that material i think a thunder coat is the way to go here
my dog chews his ass he s about to be beach ready thank you public service anouncemnet
i mean she got unwillingly cut open and had her insides changes so win win for the humans i guess
so adoreable my dog got spayed a few days ago still has the cone and hates it might try this
aww this is too adorable when the family cat got sprayed we cut off the end of panty hose and put it on her she was extra fluffy but not thicc so she looked like she was wearing a corset
this is hilarious my first dog we never got her fixed when she was in heat my mom would put tighty whities on her backward so her tail went through the hole and she didn‚Äôt bleed every where she didn‚Äôt seem to mind them at all
when my tailless bulldog had her first cycle i used elmo swim diapers and suspenders this is cuter and i wish i had thought of it
and very sexy too beautiful girl and beautiful idea my boy would lay in one spot until he died if you left it on him
"please you have to post more pics üòÇ
such a good girl"
we also do t shirt‚Äôs of shame in our house but we call them party shirts because they are always oversized professional sport tees and the dogs look like committed fans having a good time instead of post op
and she can appear on the cover of the swimsuit edition of sbarks illustrated
such a great idea and i love how her collar matches the suit btw do you know what size suit that is my dog is getting spayed at the beginning of august and i know she won t tolerate the cone
uhhh doesn t this seem super easy for the dog to still gnaw lick and bite through this would never have stopped my golden retriever looks cute sure but looks ineffective hope it works out
my friends boy just got neutered and he had to wear a onsie it was so precious
i don‚Äôt think this is ok doesn‚Äôt the wound kind of need to breath a little
aww poor baby simba just got neutered i suggested boxers to my mom or shorts she decided it was best to keep the cone on i feel so bad seeing pups wearing the cone when simba came out of the surgery he could barely walk and had to be carried into the house he s doing well though still a bit sad that he won t make some cute puppies in the future hopefully it s the best decision for his health
omg she looks like my dog dana just needs a white stripe on her chest
pretty good idea just hope she don‚Äôt bite thru the clothing
you re so smart and your pup is so sweet wishing her a fast recovery
kinda crazy that the collar already matches the bathing suit
our vet told us that female dogs don t need a cone only males we didn t use one and had no problems shrug
just make sure the incision can breathe check it every day probably better to use a cotton onesie or your vet could also get a medi shirt or something to tie on that would allow it to breathe
trying to figure out logistics of spaying our older dog yrs and she hates any article besides her collar the bathing suit is a great pro tip
if you have a smaller dog baby onesies work as well not to mention they look adorable
someone somewhere is thinking of a way to market this might want to jump on it before they do
one of our dogs just had an abscess removed from her butt she s a sheltie so suuuuuuuuper furry and they had to shave everything back there as if that didn t provide enough indignity rather than a cone they put her in a diaper for a couple days because it protects the incision and dressing from her our other dog and the environment i would say a cone might have looked less dopey
i did something like that with a t shirt sleeve for my cat worked like a charm
that is brilliant finally able to offer an alternative to our clients d
psa they sell inflatable donut collars that serve the same purpose as the cone of shame but are way easier for the dog my boy was absolutely terrified of the cone and did great with the donut and we went straight to the donut for our lickety girl too
is it though hopefully the wound can breathe there s a reason they don t cover them
my good boy hated the cone of shame so i made him a pair of shorts after he got snipped he looked adorable and they for just right so no messes or access to incision
great idea and so cute i bet the tightness of the suit also is calling like a thunder shirt
we used a little surgical suit romper type thing similar to this on our puppy and it made such a difference
brilliant my sister had to do something similar with her boy cat after he d had an operation he kept trying to get at his stitches and was pulling fur out around the wound when he worked out how to pull the cone of shame off so she put him in a baby onesie
for people saying this is genius it really isn‚Äôt no air getting at the wound and the dog can still lick or bite through the material when i see animals come in to my clinic for post op checks with a t shirt on them i just know most of the time that wound is going to be infected nobody likes the cone of shame but i really believe it‚Äôs the best thing for your pet‚Äôs speedy recovery
i did this but with a tank top i cut up my pupper is very small üòÇü§£ whatever works üòâ
we did something similar with our pupper was so much better than the cone
the tightness of the swim suit may hinder wound healing check that it is closing in the expected timeframe
odd thing my vet recommended this when we thought my cat would need surgery he said just get a cheap baby jumper and it works hope op s sweetie heals quickly
that cuddle was so cute such a human like manner imo
best milkshake of my life was from cookout also that pup is pupping cute as pup p s i miss nc now but only a little
this makes me so pumped to see my puppers when i get home from work
my pupper does stuff like this sometimes that girls face says it all pure love i‚Äôm not crying you‚Äôre crying
lmfao for some reason the girl s face at the end reminds me of emilia clarke
hhhngggg i looovvvveeee head snoogles my dog loves having his head cradled he s a big boye so hard to pick up and when the cuddle up like that it s just the very best
this is too cute ü§© and her expression when the dog cuddles her is priceless ‚ò∫Ô∏è good thing to end the day on üòä
awww being able to satisfy your maternal instincts without it barfing and shitting or crying loudly wonderful
so i‚Äôm assuming the dog is really showing affection i was scrolling through the comments to find that one guy who goes that gesture actually means the dog is dying
canadian passing by i have never seen a cup that large or head of cook out
oh when he puts his head on a girl s chest he s adorable but when i do it i m weird and under arrest damn double standards
i know there are people in the world who don t like dogs but like how even
every time i see this i stop and watch it a minimum x‚Äôs
huh that girl does not age i swear i ve seen her here before ohhhh
i know this is off topic but cookout is low key the best fast food joint ever
i remember the first time a dog hugged me ‚Äî i never experienced an unconditional type of love like that before it was indescribable
my pup does this too üò≠üò≠üò≠ i always wondered if he did it out of affection or just wants pets lol
this is clearly a cook out commercial not actual customers
you can actually pinpoint the moment that her heart melts
i believe that this was the dog‚Äôs final days of living saw it on twitter a while ago
i think i understand why americans are obese a little better now is that cup unusually large or just regularly so
awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww legend says tjrowsterrip is still awwing till today
i m surprised u gallowboob our resident repeated reposter and recycler of spam didn t get to this one first nice work
why do those dogs always seem to end up with brown dirty looking fur around their mouths that never seem to come clean
aww i love that cookout restaurant especially their m amp m and oreo milkshakes
that s at expression of being absolutely overwhelmed with love
my doggy used to do this too she was such a sweet baby rip maya
my pupper does this and it makes my heart explode every time
i know this girl we used to be fuck buddies till i found out she had a boyfriend
jesus christ it s no wonder there s so many fat americans when you guys have milkshakes that big
on an unrelated note i moved back up north and really miss cookout someone needs to tell them to expand
that s how we interpret it sure that dog is probably just tired
i was just thinking about where i should get dinner i forgot about cookout thanks
i feel like i first saw this years ago still melts my heart
da flop i swear it‚Äôs the sweetest most genuine thing i‚Äôve ever experienced i‚Äôm one lucky gal to experience this everyday
cook out is the best attraction here one of the biggest perks to being nc born and bred
poodles are in the top most intelligent dog breeds that dog is almost as emotionally developed as a small child
i read that as puppet puppets have no choice they must love me
i ve had a fairly crappy day and this made me a little brighter
i love head plops like this i ve had my pup for years and i still make this face when she does this
am i the only one freaking out at the size of that drink its huge doggo is also cute tho
i have this exact breed and i can confirm they are so loving my baby nikko will give me hugs and will hold on to me with his little paws
what the friggidy frack is with that drink size ye gods i thought when i saw drinks that large on tv they were just comedically enhanced for shock value
i see the cook out cup and i love that place i make sure to stop in when we‚Äôre in ga or tn
her expression is how i feel every time i look at my dog and see the way he looks at me
how many times does this have to get posted each time someone new lol
my cousin‚Äôs baby did this to me and that was when i decided i like babies
squints at cookout cup god dammit now i want onion rings and a strawberry cheese cake milkshake
the dog is great and all but can we talk about the ltrs of milkshake someone is just going to town on
must be a curly haired dog thing our labradoodle daisy just loves doing this to mum
my dog does this with my boyfriend she truly loves him and then she looks at me like saying he s mine bitch gtfo
that fucking mega gulp disguts me to the point that i can no longer focus on the adorableness
whenever a pupper or a cat lay their head on me i visibly melt too
omg i miss cookout so much someone please bring that restaurant to california
that soda there i guess that s kinda big the simpson s episode where they visit australia look it up
you know that feeling where your heart just kind of swells up in you ur chest but in a good way just had that
bichons are actually this sweet in real life pretty much just want to stay by your side and be your companion
one dog is singular therefore using they amp their is incorrect
this is a level of precious that shouldnt be possible
i may get a lot of hate for saying this but i love puppers and doggos
coook oooooout ah i miss those deep fried virginia nights
so cute and that milkshake is almost bigger than her
i m just here to downvote anyone using the words doggo or pupper
i just kept staring at that liter of cola it s so big
when i m feeling sad i ll come here to maek me haeppy
khari is still young the murder instinct hasn t kicked in yet
my bengal is rarely off my lap he s a proper little snuggle bug
man who s stacked enough he looks like hecould play for the bengals holding a bengal my kinda photo
bengals are historically non threatening especially on a football field
bengals are very much into human contact whomever said otherwise never had one
khari thinks khari s coat coordinates beautifully with your shirt
my parents bengal is about or and he loves to cuddle more than any cat i ve ever seen he also likes to shit on my shoulders
by the way you have a twin brother and i will post his pic as soon as i get home
god reposts are all this sub is nowadays it s disappointing
my bengals were super cuddly lap cats i can t imagine bengals any other way now
they look cuddly but they sure make a pretty terrible football team
pos imposter op i bet you re a fat ass basement dweller incel irl
savage they are savage see how she lures you in i wonder how this poor chap is hrs in dehydrated and sore with stiffness but will she release him no she s evil in furry body suit
now i genuinely generalize eating tomato s but potato
you totally need to get an agent for this ridiculously photogenic fashion cat of yours
so cute it makes me angry but just angry that i can t snuggle the wild animal that might bite me
what i‚Äôve learned recently from this sub is that all animals as babies are absolutely adorable
credit to u vechrotex i tried to put it in the title but i can‚Äôt edit titles
anyone ever hear a fox mating call one of the most disturbing sound you will ever hear
deadass reposting another dudes picture for karma what a fucking asshole this guy is
i heard in some cases foxes can be domesticated any truth
i need to know exactly where this photo was taken so i can uh make sure the uh little fox is healthy that sounds true right
baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyy beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee fox ka chaw ka chaw ka chaw baby fox du du du du du deee doo baby fox yapp yapp yapp y yapp y yapp
aww that s so cute definitely need a smile after today
down voted because theft find something original to post surprised the mods haven t gotten you yet
repost or not i‚Äôm glad this happ boi has blessed my timeline again
this thing is ridiculously cute i d let it inside hell it could rip apart my apartment which it probably would and it would be just fine with me i d be like oh look it s destroying the sofa how cute
a what a baby fox a what a baby fox ooooh this is a baby fox a what
don t let the cuteness fool you that thing will fuck you up
that s what makes a great day right there i would love to walk to my back door and see a kit i think that s the right word my best chance is a baby alligator or a full grown tweaker i live in florida
was about to like it but then realized that op just stole it from someone else shame on you op
baby fox doo doo doo doo doo doo baby fox doo doo doo doo doo doo baby fox doo doo doo doo doo doo baby fox
this is the most wholesome thing i‚Äôve seen in along time
just an psa i saved a baby fox that got hit by a car a couple years ago and it smelled so goood if you ever have the chance take a big ole whiff of a wild baby fox you will not regret it
d i c k h e a d don‚Äôt repost on the same fucking subreddit you fucking codswallop
a fox is simply dog hardware running cat software it is so adorable unlike a mac trying to run windows
why are people upvoting if this is obviously a repost
let down your invisible force field hooman i want to lick u at once
if i saw this in my window i would be laughing so hard
how do you not open the door and feed the little guy
you are a bitch for stealing and hoarding is that the only thing you could achieve in your pathetic life
i made the weirdest squeak and attempted to say ‚Äúoh my god‚Äù
why the fuck are people suddenly getting all upset about this being reposted from another person that s like what of what every reddit post is
i never knew there was such a thing the cat seems to like it
i could only ever wish to be as comfy as that cat is
i have one of those takes seconds on half power any more and he starts to melt but he s not a fan of the turntable
psa don t put your cats in a microwave this thing is different
my cat s would love this and since their birthday is coming up sisters this is what i m going to get them
the universe was smiling on you with this one appreciate it
he will never forget that first meal he had with his new momma
thank you for taking this poor little guy in you‚Äôre a hero
so much luck obviously this pup was meant for you and you for him
please make sure he‚Äôs not somebody‚Äôs missing pup thanks for taking care of him
those eyes say it all complete adoration he‚Äôs a keeper
i m gonna need a picture of the puppy s belly to verify it s full
there is just something so adorable about his face and those glorious shiny eyes
hopefully he‚Äôs microchipped and you can find his owner
his face is like ‚Äúthis was a test and you passed proud of you‚Äù
i clearly need to move to a place with a porch cause all i get is bird shit out back
this is how we got our old girl but i spent three weeks seriously looking for her owners before we claimed her as our own
does a he awoo he looks like he‚Äôs a very good awoo er
how come i never find a puppy like that on my porch so damn cute hed be mine n his new name would be chewy
post updates when he gets older he looks like a cute lil man so i‚Äôm curious what he‚Äôll look like when he‚Äôs older
guess i‚Äôll be one of few to just say thank you for taking care of üêæüêæ in the first place
those eyebrows are a indicator of a very wise pupper
what a cute pup like others said please make sure he s not missing but if all checks out what a cute pup you just got
lol i sincerely doubt that is a stray as someone who has seen strays all my life it s always baffled me how some people think any animal that is on their property is a free for all
a name tag on animals would solve this problem even if a dog is chipped you are asking another person to take time out of their day to take to vet to see if the dog cat is chipped due to you not wanting to add another way to find owners
my dog is down stairs where he rests after eating if you ask him though he s also starving and would like some food best of luck with the new pup
anyone who lost this little one doesn‚Äôt deserve them
i‚Äôm taking him to the vet first thing tomorrow thank you all for the suggestions
he looks so beautiful i‚Äôd love to know what type of dog he is his hair would be fun to comb
and you got a picture of the only time the cat used it well done op
can your husband make me some bunk beds i have cats
needs a bedside table lamp cats like to read at night
should get one of those cat beds that reflect their heat looks like it would fit well on top we got my cat one and it only its on it now
i don t know it s cute sure but it s also scaring the fuck out of this baby on purpose bit uncool
reverse the gif to have a kitten acrobatically intimidating a phone
omg thank you so much for saving that sweet little kitty and may your kindness be returned to you a hundred fold
lookin like you re about to recruit the kitten to the alt right
i‚Äôm glad having your anus removed hasn‚Äôt stopped you from living your best life
she s been thru a lot for a little baby thank you for helping her
now you need one more it is kitty season so shelters will have them
congratulations he definitely looks like a very good boy
honestly looks a bit like patrick stewart v han some
cute meanwhile my dog just got put out of the living room for crapping on the floor üòÇ
i don‚Äôt know if anyone‚Äôs said this yet but you can still like animals without talking like an illiterate asswipe
man that is so awesome i know you will be happy i would just shave his beard
he is def the goodest boi congratulations on ur new family member
i think he should accessorize with a top hat a monocle and a walking stick
if a cute man with a beard held me like that i d be a good boy too
ah yes the highly coveted golden retriever velociraptor designer breed all the rage right now would invite on a play date to jurassic park
look at those big pawsssss awe i remember when my baby was that small
cats are so extra look at how she pokes it was curving her body like that necessary absolutely yes if you ask her lolol
having it literally on the edge of the stairs steps seems extremely irresponsible i mean just push it back a foot or two just to eliminate that risk
lol kitty has never seen a frog before mine used to do this when i let her go outside and it seemed like every creature was new and fun
kitty has absolutely no clue how to handle this situation the tail isn t puffed up like a pringles can but still has the kitty cat ridge back going on knows it s another creature but can t figure out how to approach it amp x b is it a mean thing what happens when i touch it can i get more info if i look at it closely upside down does it smell different if i look at it closely upside down amp x b it s such a cool thing to watch someone s something s intelligent process of discovery as compared to the only step being can i eat this particularly when they re left to their own devices
ain‚Äôt gonna be cute when that think snaps at it is that a turtle that could do damage
reminds me of a video i saw with a cat and a turtle playing tag
i was waiting for the reaction when the head poked out
"roses are red
i like netflix and chill
this fluff looks like an orange
and is smiling at me"
your dog looks like a mammal version of a dandelion
it s a stuffed animal that gets reposted all the time sorry to be that guy
this is boris he is weeks old and he is a caucasian ovcharka
just wait till he s bigger he will be even more protective such a good boy and so beautiful too
some pups are so tenacious and they just don t realize how small they are my youngest was just a few months old maybe pounds my husband was walking her around the block and one of my ghetto ass neighbor s pit bulls jumped the fence and charged at them this little dog jumped up and bit that pittie right in the face and it ran away and jumped back in it s yard
it isn t the size of the dog in the fight but the fight in the dog congrats on your awesome new security guard
scared him off he ll be back amp x b with friend amp x b and knives
i think i have the exact same jacket and omg that thing is so soft
most black bears are wusses even house cats have been known to scare them off
well with dog like that you dont gotta worrie about someone breaking into your place cause whe dose will be dog food lol good boy wink
this is the animal equivalent of us being scared by a spider
and the magnificent little asshole is gonna milk every second out of it as should be üòç‚ù§Ô∏è
commenting to say that i have the same fleece blanket good dog
i wonder if bears are like humans they see a baby and figure an enraged mother is seconds behind
was concerned about the ear for a moment until i checked the comments xd
adorable puppy it‚Äôs a shame you called him an ah but sadly not surprising given your own username
are you using swear words to appear edgy how old are you i literally see no purpose of you using ah in this post
adorable pup and good job scaring off the üêª just curious with no snark or animosity whatsoever what made you choose this breed of dog from what i‚Äôm hearing they sound like a breed that comes with a lot of liability
never will understand why people refer to their pets with derogatory names like asshole
on a journey i met one of your kind his name was katow jo we became friends
bears are just big softies i have gotten really close and have pet wild ones a couple of times in the woods cute puppy
black bears are known to be wimps though still that dog s gonna be massive good luck affording the food bill and the backhoe to pick up its shit gorgeous animal
bears are all like live to tip over your garbage can another day
he was waiting for the opposable thumbs guy at the top for the assist
you can pinpoint the exact moment he accepts his fate
probably would have made it if his way wasn t blocked by someone with a camera
i want this to be known i will and always will be proud of moosey
he had the intelligence and self composure to just move on so i am proud
i love moosey his ‚Äúdogged determination‚Äù is second to none cheers
at least this moosey tried my moosey would stare at you like you re asking me to do what
it was more than enough moosey don t let anyone tell you otherwise
gu‚Äôboy moosey he did far better than i could do lol
i‚Äôm not convinced he didn‚Äôt do exactly what he wanted
yes forever proud good job moosey next time you will make it
you just described my life with that said i‚Äôm very proud of him such a good pup
i think moosey executed what he had planned that‚Äôs clearly the most efficient way to slide
i tried so hard and got so far but in the end it doesn t even matter
the sploot on the way dowwwn i just can t moosey i loove youuuuu
my nephew s cousin they re both likes to climb up the slide to slide down even though she knows it s the wrong way

hopefully your loki never feels stabby they are sweet together
i was like that looks like a slipknot shirt but it doesn t read the same then i realized it was backwards
he‚Äôs got a cat strapped on him as a new slip knot mask
that looks like an ‚Äúalternate universe‚Äù thor and loki comic book cover
your dad looks finnish especially with the heavy metal shirt
your dad looks about my age so either he looks way younger than he is or i just realized i m old enough to have a child who uses reddit o o
weeks ago i don t even like cats keep that thing away from me and you better clean up after it
your dad has excellent taste in music and kittens lol
aww that s adorable can i pat his belly also the cat is cute p
i have a little grey bastard who looks like him also named loki
that guy looks way too young to be a dad haha rock on ü§òüèæü§òüèæü§òüèæ
when you realize someone with a kid old enough to be on reddit looks the same age as you and is wearing the t shirt of that band you liked in highschool
he looks like a ginger version of jack black i love it
are you gay if so i‚Äôd eat your ass like a jello pudding pie
looks like odin and loki having quality son and dad time
the thumbnail looks like he s got a cat scarf on i swear i saw cats before opening the full image
his new cat is probably gonna end up stealing an infinity stone
this is not a little orange kitten but it is little and adorable
swear to god everyone on this site has named their dog or cat loki
i sometimes forget how old i actually am and then i see posts like this one op how old are you i think i m at least a decade older than your dad üò≥
they both look so happy to be together i swear that cat is smiling too
your dad looks like he would be the uber redditor if he still had his virginity
your dad looks ten years younger than me how old are you op
be careful there bud he might suddenly transform into an asgardian frost giant and stab you
loki looks adorable but also like he‚Äôs up to something not sure if i trust him
that moment you realize slipknot fans are old enough to have reddit aged children where has the time gone
came here for the ‚Äúhow old is your dad and how old are you ‚Äù comments
can t tell what band shirt he is wearing but by the design i can tell he has a shitty taste in music
i actually giggled out loud they re so bloody cute together
plot twist it turns out that the cat is the real loki
loki already has your dad wrapped around his paw op good job loki üòÑ
there should be its own subreddit for burly men with kittens
i‚Äôm so old your dad is too young for me to date it‚Äôs moments like this that make me realise how fast life passes you by
does anyone else think that cat looks slightly like a painting for some reason
both the magical beast looks super happy its all about the smile
my heart audibly melted and my own kitty cat looked at me concerned lol
your dad and loki both look so thrilled with themselves love this
it disguises itself as a beard to attack unsuspecting enemies and people who try to change the channel steal snacks or touch the thermostat when he dozes off
what a sweet kitty cat loki was one of the names i thought about naming my cat ended up calling him achilles cause he was always around my heels
your dad seems pretty chill and metal at the same time
why do all these fat dads get up votes start promoting a healthy lifestyle you fat fucks
euron greyjoy surely let himself go after the finale
your dad looks just like friar tuck from the kevin costner robin hood
your dad looks awesome but why does that cat have a beard
niiiiiiice shirt pretty sure i still have that one in my closet somewhere i‚Äôm not a huge cat person but this picture made my wife want to get another one üòëüòÇ
this is the best of both worlds a rocker dad with a slipknot shirt on that s supposed to be a big badass showing his softer side with his little kitty u rockü§òü§òü§ò
what are you talking about please acknowledge how handsome that boy is
he is the most handsome what a wonderful looking dog üòä
that looks like you rewound the cat falling off the bed
i have a theory that felines actually have anti gravity electro magnetic thruster paws
the jump is great but the raggedy ass whiskers make it
that is exactly how my cat jumps up on my bed but she meows as she lands from my viewpoint it looks like she just appears and immediately meows hello it s hilarious
i m a dog person but shit like this makes me also want a cat
the cat has a look on its face that says i know where this picture is gonna end up again big whoop cat jumps on bed news at pfft jackass
not his first meowdeo i ll see myself out shouldn t have valeted the car
looks like tony hawk stepping out of the half pipe so smooth
michael jackson background music üé∂cause i m a smooth criminalüé∂
wow that was smooth af my cat is fat but thinks hes light and does not have the same effect as video cat
ummm why is this cat the cutest lil short poofer ever
this almost looks reversed but when i look at it as if it‚Äôs reversed then it looks normal what is the truth
legit this is how my pittie gets on the bed he s lbs and agile like a ninja i love his grace
"a wild cat has appeared to pokemon battle theme meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meooowwwwwww
meow meow"
jumps up hi human i am here to help lighten you day but now you can fuck off
my cat is fat so her jumping on the bed is more of a heave thump
i m no longer sure how many times i watched this but i know it is not enough
cats are crazy good at jumping and being graceful about it
for some reason i hear samuel jackson s voice saying some bad ass comment within that cats eyes
yeah d you fucking see that shit looks aways course you did
i didn‚Äôt care enough to pick a side but my only real problem with kanye interrupting taylor swift was he did it when she was wearing a floor length gown that clip was played non stop for days and every time i watched it i was disappointed that i couldn‚Äôt see taylor‚Äôs feet i don‚Äôt care much for kanye‚Äôs music and i don‚Äôt care much for taylor swift‚Äôs music that trouble song was catchy but i do enjoy taylor‚Äôs sexy feet and it would made the whole stunt more bearable if i‚Äôd have had them to look at
this gif is backwards the real cat was jumping down
he has a sophisticated face then when he looked to the side he has a curl in his ‚Äòstache
this is the sole reason i like cats im a dog person
i know you re just reposting to farm karma but this gif always makes me smile so have an upvote don t start posting it everyday though
op actually pushed cat off bed with massive air cannon and reversed the film
cats seem to defy gravity i know my big fat cat jumps up on the bed or the dresser effortlessly imagine if humans could jump up onto an object or feet up without even taking a breath
fuck you got k upvotes for a cat jumping on the bed i‚Äôm a dog person obviously
ok now that i m right next to you i m going to look totally uninterested but that just means i love you more than you know
the cat is thrown up there someone figured this out last time
that move is so smooth it seems it somehow defies the laws of physics
that basically summarize cat‚Äôs laziness he jumped with minimal effort to clear the edge jumping any higher would be wasting energy
how high is the bed it looks kinda like a bull bed pretty meowstastic landing
something this reminded me of was the line when she texts you saying she is home alone and asks you to come over
cats are like kangaroos until they get to be about or still lovely little animals but getting up in age my year old is so precious but she can t jump like she used to
sees xbox controller ernie prepares to commit a hate crime
that second kitten to come out just booked it for freedom
let them fight this is not going as we thought it would be
very cute indeed i just wish they hadn t filmed it through a fly screen
please be babies please be babies as i longingly smirk as the seconds tick what the hell kind of humor am i cursed with
cats ain t into all that shit when they first see you unless they choose to be
the real stunner here is the amount of cats fit in tht cage
ngl the opening had me convince ed this was a clickhole video
that would be the most satisfying swarm to lie down in
i honestly think those kittens have seen dogs before i had cats and dogs for a big part of my life and the first time kittens saw dogs they usually started hissing and making themselves big or at least bushy tail however i see those kittens pretty relaxed with them and even happy
please don t tell me that was milk in that bowl surely theyre not that stupid
you aren‚Äôt supposed to give kittens or puppies milk both are naturally lactose intolerant until you start bringing up their tolerance with diluted milk based on how young these animals are that milk they are drinking is almost certainly not diluted enough though i doubt it‚Äôs diluted at all
the level of cute is so high that the image becomes pixels
where do i get the uzbekistan public television plugin
when i saw the crates i was like is it going to kittens meeting kittens or puppies meeting puppies lo and behold kittens and puppies

i wonder how many people are going to comment in memeanese
‚Äúintroducing‚Äù would imply that this is the first time this was posted it‚Äôs not

oh sorry i‚Äôm a new cat mom so i know nothing anyway she‚Äôs beautiful
did he do a cartwheel on his face at the beginning ‚ù§Ô∏è
did he try to run forward but his face got caught on the ground and his body kept moving
omg at first i thought it was golden retriever but then i was bamboozled
i love how puppies heads have to catch up to their bodies when they re being all quick n goofy n stuff
that is the cutest fuckin shit ive ever seen in my life

too cool to be called max any dog is try just harder and your parents could come up with perry or curlyderp or winston or salvador even reddit would be better please let your folks know and follow with the name change thanks
this boy is going to be a massive literally goofball aint he
its so sad to see people behave like this you go down to lure the dog in and then back out top to show the puppy you dont care for him when he comes to you you are a monster
beautiful thick green grass beautiful hyper prescious pupper is it bad i got distracted from the cutie pie by the nice grass
this ball of fluff flying around is the only thing i want now

not to be dramatic but i would literally die for max
he soooo fuckin idiot and i want to eat his face badly like a hot dog sandwich
i was thinking that goldendooles should lead a very health life because of the genetic diversity i hope this is true
such a cute little copycat better watch your mouth around that one üòÇ

is this your video i‚Äôve been trying to get a cat tree like this
my sister has a cat with a brain issue he s never been able to balance very well though he can see just fine he could never climb that cat tree or move so well
that‚Äôs kinda horrifying imagine waking up with a goddamn slender man cat sitting on your chest ‚Äústaring‚Äù into your face
these videos always make me want to cry but only because i want to love these kitties so much
it s interesting that they still have the desire to be up high even if they cant see their kingdom
how often do you guys think about sht like ‚Äúimagine if i was that blind cat ‚Äù i look at little ants outside my window imagine being born an ant we all share this earth with our one life its insane isn‚Äôt it
blind cats are so cute one eyed cats are cute two eyed cats are cute my point is cats are cute
i have an almost blind cat it runs into walls and i feel bad when i laugh at it
nah cat s can see in the dark so they can see even if they are blind
maybe a good idea would be to cut a hole in that middle platform to make it easier to climb up and down
my nan adopted an old deaf cat she had him for a few years before he went blind he was able to navigate the house through bumping into walls and remembering the layout
i showed this gif to my blind friend to cheer them up anything s possible buddy
i had a friend once with a blind kitty she was amazing in the way she was able to like jump up on the couch for scritches and stuff and just navigate her way around the apartment just like a kitty who could see if she was unsure of where she was which i only saw once she would like feel around in front of her with her paws
the question might sound silly i m sorry i know too little about blind animals in her case it looks like she holds her eyes shut does she or does that happen naturally like it s uhm growing close i m not sure how to actually call it does someone maybe know
did you sleep at all those days i would worry beyond belief
i handed out about flyers trying to find her one business i walked into to ask if they would post it up was a tire shop and the owner said he would post a picture of her on his facebook also had about other people post her on facebook too we‚Äôll turns out this guy ran for a political seat for the towns local government so he was friends with basically the whole town the last day we were looking for her someone called him and said they spotted her walking down a particular street so he called us and we headed over there got her side note i actually saw her the previous day but she‚Äôs so skittish that even when she saw me she still ran away because she was still so scared my fianc√© was with me the second time we saw her and she was able to coax her close enough so we could grab her
scary good that you were able to be reunited with your pup
i lost my cat once well my girlfriends cat i am not a cat person at all but i was so relieved when i found it i always thought i wouldn t care if he was gone or we gave him away but i guess he became family at some point
aww bless so glad you found her she obviously missed you too ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
damn i‚Äôd be going nuts as i‚Äôm sure you were glad it turned out okay where was he she found
not saying op is bad just a psa properly off leash train your pets people it s for their safety
glad you found him i had a pupper roam into my lawn off the street one day just trekking along with no real mission i look around for someone but nope lone pupper on his own adventure i grab his collar and walk over to the street and just stood there waiting i had a feeling the owner was looking for him so i was patient and waited after a little while i see a truck driving slow around a corner and all of a sudden speed up to me a man and woman hopped out looking so extremely distraught like they were both crying just moments before i don t even think they said a word to me scooped the pupper up and drove off
man we lost our year old dog for months she went outside when the front door was open and we didn‚Äôt know someone pretty much stole her because she was found city‚Äôs away luckily tho we micro chipped her and she was returned to us because she also escaped from who ever took her and the pound picked her up
what breed is that gorgeous pupper and i m glad you re reunited
bless what a relief for you all tp find each other again i d be beside myself if my fur baby disappeared fir minutes
so glad it ended well how scary for both of you give her all the snuggles
just last night my lab escaped and i was searching for him for a couple of hours thought this was it never gonna find him and then i see him tired and confused walking on a sidewalk a mile away from home what a relief however he was hesitant to get both inside the car and then jump out when we reached home he had that guilty look like he was in trouble gave him some treats and petted him to get him to relax hope he doesn‚Äôt associate escape with treats pets and car rides üòÖ
i know how much i love my dogs i can t imagine what you were going through i am so glad you found her safe and sound actually went awww when i see the picture you shared
no kidding if one of my animals got lost it would just annihilate me and in finding them again i would take days to re balance myself
still waiting for my kitty to come home after fours years call the humane society occasionally to see if she ever came through maybe i need to let go glad your baby is home
agshdjdks these are so cute i dont think i ve ever seen one before
i maintain that the platypus is the palindrome of the animal kingdom
anyone get the urge to pick their bills off like a scab
yes they are and now i m in love with them thank you op ‚ù§
fun fact the male platypus is venomus toxic masculinity perhaps
my favorite animal in the world they prove god does indeed have a sense of humour
the platypuse bill the lego of nature it looks like the parents carry around little platy bills and stick them on after they are born
these things get more weird every time i look at one mole claws fuzz like a kiwi some sort of nose bill combo and apparently they have human pig tone skin on their bellies still cute somehow
they look so inexplicable and yet that‚Äôs why i love them so
fuck i need to break all my figmas to feel manly again
you can just tell the young lady is a beautiful soul may she and her new dog live long and healthy lives
omg still chopping onions up in here lol this was so awesome the kids seem genuinely sweet and kind too
this is heart melting but also the well trained kids that shut the door behind them props
i‚Äôm not even chopping onions i‚Äôm just crying enjoy that doggo
i had to come to the comments to see if anyone else cried i feel manly again knowing i‚Äôm not alone
omg that dogs like ‚Äòlet me go that‚Äôs my friend ‚Äô im sobbing
it s videos like these that make my redditing at work incredibly obvious i just caught myself massively smiling at my screen for this video and they must think that i m really into my invoices
there is a meme here somewhere that expression is great
my cat and i often make noises at one another she takes it much more in stride
well you d make that face if the cat said who s a good kitty back to you
to be fair your gf would be surprised too if the cat talked back in human tongue oh hi michaela how s it going
will you please post whatever name you end up choosing
anyone trying to better themselves is this blessed image congrats on the self improvement baby peacocks
so posh and dainty already i wonder what baby peacocks sound like ‚Äòcause the grown ups can be an extreme loud bunch
soon this seemingly lacklustre specimen will show his true colours
this is a dinosaur and i refuse to believe otherwise
i ve never seen a baby peacock up until this moment and i m so glad i have now what a handsome little man
my cat did something similar except it ran in the house when i opened a door and that s how i got a cat
that is virtually identical to how we got our cat i was in bed on a saturday morning and my wife was up drinking coffee at ish she thought that she heard the same thing and in walks a tiny cat this is my life now
are you going to see if he is microchipped before keeping him
it‚Äôs how i got a cat she was tiny and screamed at me from behind a trash can at a store in my town she‚Äôs and still a whiny girl
i‚Äôm so jealous i can‚Äôt lure a cat for the life of me
human i have been assigned to you you took too long to answer the door i hope you learn fast
he s saying hey hey hey hey hey you there i m your new cat can t you see that hey hey
kind of it s actually how cats choose humans but same same
looks quite clean and well cared for nice white teeth might belong to someone get it checked at the vet to see if it s chipped
he s got a voice with soul and two thumbs up for you welcome to your life of servitude
soooooo pretty stunning picture too smartphones or an a camera would you mind sharing congrats on your new feline friend üòª
confirmed i was screamed at by an orange tabby now he steps on me and purrs loudly when i sleep
you are trying to sneak up on the cat but you‚Äôre dummy thicc and the clap of your asscheeks keeps alerting the kitty
no this isn‚Äôt how you get a cat it obviously belongs to someone and got out maybe they were taking it to the vet and it got out of their car away from their home i‚Äôm sick of posts showing people finding a ‚Äústray‚Äù then just keeping it don‚Äôt be that person
for me the first bit is always the other way around i hear what sounds like a cat in distress and immediately check outside only to realize oh it s just a screaming kid don t care
true story when my family was living in cali we heard a blood curdling ‚Äúwwwwwhhhhyyyyy wwwwhhhhyyyy ‚Äù coming from our back yard sounded like a wounded child me and my bro rushed to the backyard while mom was about to ninja speed dial rush out back turn on the light and it was the neighborhood tom looking for a mate
a poly i have had two polys one sadly passed affectionately named six toes now we have a little black poly name mr hemingway after the author who had a thing for polys enjoy your sweet little happy toes may his toes bring you good luck sailors considered them to be good luck
that is exactly how you get a cat unless the owner comes knocking then it s just visiting
several human duties need to be performed before he can properly adopt you tho vets visit for checkup and chipcheck
lol he wants some meow mix you know the food they ask for by name
first look for a chip in some countries is mandatory like in chile second check on social media and local vet if someone is looking for him thrid if someone claim it ask for evidence of owning fouth if none works yes now you have a cat a poly cat remember this cat could have a family waiting for him somewhere people that love him
make sure you check for a chip with the vet but if doesn t have one enjoy your new cat
that s exactly how you must be a proud new cat owner
it s how we got one of ours she was hungry and started screaming at my wife from the woods it must have taken a lot for her to do that because she s terrified of strangers and will hide for days if we have company over
they actually evolved to mimic the sound of crying children to get empathy and shelter from humans i believe
why do people on this subreddit always take pictures of animals while naked and include thighs and feet i purposefully make sure my nude parts are out of the frame when i photograph my pets but maybe i m the strange one
you have been visited by the cat faerie adopt cat for cat
yes you don t choose it chooses you especially if it has human hands that s your witch familiar no doubt
umm you don t get a cat what really happens is they decide you re their pet and graciously allow you in their life
in my experience quite often yes cats have a tendancy to choose their slaves you don t choose them
tabby cats are so sweet mine is very vocal and a sweet lap cat
i‚Äôm definitely going to ask around my apartment complex but i think he‚Äôs a stray for one he‚Äôs not neutered so if he is an outdoor pet i have some very irresponsible neighbors he was also evacuated and very dirty so if he got out he‚Äôs been alone a while poor lil dude
pretty much my brother got new cats cuz they had cats beforehand so just like kids they would want to be with the others where its fun i d check for a chip or hear with the neighbors first to avoid legal issues though
i see you took the cat magnet perk too my neighbour s cat comes to see me anytime i m outside and have had to profusely apologize for him sneaking into my house behind me neighbour is chill with it but we often joke the cat enjoys me more than him amp x b i saw you re going to go do your due diligence so i won t harp anymore if your new friend is without a family take care of him and his extra toes you ve been given a wonderful gift
you don‚Äôt get a cat a cat gets a human you were evidently chosen by this lil‚Äô guy
in pokemon you choose your pokemon in real life the cat chooses the owner
same but it seemed to be cats having sex and another cat unhappy about it
you don t adopt cats they deign to let you house and feed them
omg hes a polydactyl god i keep seeing them and i want one so much
i was living at an apartment complex once i m kind of a light sleeper and around am i heard someone yelling halp halp it sounded a little weird and warbled but i just had to sneak a look out the window i was expecting a young girl based on the sound instead i found a fat cat laying on the pavement yelling halp halp
quick he s trying to tell you there s a kid down a well
i got one the other day when i was mowing they kept running in front of the mower trying to get away so i stopped and picked it up and put it in the woods since then somebody informed me that it s bad to touch baby deer because the mother will smell you i hope it lives all the same i guess it s better i didnt hit it
i‚Äôve heard the mother leaves them to hide in a safe place while she gets food
this totally isn t a repost man like this really is the first time i saw this adorable picture guys
fun fact sometimes baby deers are being placed in farmers fields if the grass is tall enough and if they are really unlucky the farmer has planned to mow his field that day
i misread this title expectations weren t met but still cute p
how do you resist kissing it i have ok self control but this would ve break my will
i found like the exact same thing and got upvotes lmao
people keep finding same animal over years in reddit
cutting a field of alfalfa one afternoon i came upon a fawn about that age i stopped the tractor and picked it up to where i had already cut it didn t move a muscle but it s heart was going a mile a minute next time around it was gone it s mom must of freaked out when she saw me with her baby and took it into the woods
why does it seem that so many people find fawns i want to find one
it looks so soft and velvety not that you should find out by touching it of course
ears are straight fawns doing great ears are curled fawns alone in the world
why my dolphin not working laughs wait is that real proceeds to laugh even hardeer
the only thing i can find while repairing a fence is a giant spider trying to attack me
this is actually a stress response for baby deer it‚Äôs so they‚Äôre not hunted while the mother is away that‚Äôs why the bramble is circled out
as tempting as it is do not touch a baby deer the smell of human can cause a mother to reject or abandon a fawn
anything that make you go aww is welcome cute coyote
sweet baby i hope he has a good life what‚Äôs the story
all the upvotes they re cute as lil pups and absolutely majestic full grown granted more dangerous to be around but still beautiful creatures
as long as he doesn t turn up with a box marked acme i m sure he ll be fine
way more welcome than someone‚Äôs newborn carbon footprint
what kind of silly question is that of course they are
ok sure the adults might give the rest of the breed a bad rep but baby coyotes are cayutees approved
if i found him outside i would have thought he was a lost puppy
if you keep posting pictures of this good boy then yes yes they are
yes they are welcome with open arms they must go into said open arms for initiation the initiation is hugs
i would be aww ing but coyotes almost killed my dog that my parents rescued before i was born she s sitting on my bed right now lol
my mom did find a baby coyote pup many years ago in california she raised it and when she came back to florida a wolf rescue preserve took her mom had her about years
why does the guy in the back look like the grandpa that ate paint
let this adorable pup be the reason you boycott canada goose
he s cute but they kill a lot of cats and farm animals in my area
serious question can you train a coyote like you would a dog if you have a pup not that i am trying to catch a coyote pup or anything just curious on if they can be on the same level as a dog
baby coyote does nothing logan paul pulls out a glock
started to scroll past this and at first glance it looked like a full grown coyote in a giant mickey mouse hand xd my tired self was like since when do they let coyotes into disneyworld
no nearly killed two of my dogs coyotes are the literal definition of unnatural abominations
thought it was normal size till i saw andre the giant s hand for proportion
i can t believe how calm it is my dad and i tried to rescue a litter we found abandoned and they were mean little critters
no sir they are not you will have to hand it over immediately
they look so cute i don‚Äôt understand how people can allow these animals to be trapped for fur
if you see a big one outside he ll make you go aaahhhhh for sure
what s the difference between a coyote and a dog same question for wolves
cute yes pests that eat and attack livestock also yes put it back were you found it
i love how he started to swim before even touching the water
why does this guy keep trying to hold him he would have an easier time swimming if he wasn‚Äôt getting his back end lifted up
i¬¥ve seen this around times in a row if anyone is wondering
he already knew how to swim it‚Äôs instinctual experience and confidence ‚Äîthat‚Äôs what he‚Äôs after
puppies swimming are the cutest fucking thing he s trying so hard
wouldn‚Äôt it be easier if there was a life preserver on the pup
there are life jackets for dogs he could ve easily bought
it should be something that identifies with their fur colors
i chose none of these their names are now hans wurmhat and pepperjack
the decision was made and i chose none of these meet hans wurmhat and pepperjack
my malmute would devour this then lose all her coat because of her chicken allergy
i have small dogs chicken bones are a bad idea hope that‚Äôs deboned
very polite doggo you know s he wants that chicken but knows s he shouldn t good pupper
do you want pancreatitis because that s how you get pancreatitis
just why might as well giving it a liter of mountain dew to wash it down
he knows better than you that chicken bones splinter and get caught in dogs throats probably wonders why your tryin to do him in
he‚Äôs waiting to share it with his best friend mr cluckers
what a well behaved good doggie my dogs would have put piranhas to shame with how quickly they would have devoured that chicken
our dogo did the same thing when we got him a cheese burger and fries because he had to spend the night in the truck after arriving to a hotel with a no pet policy he didn t eat the burger till i picked it up out of the bowl and fed it to him by hand
good boy knows he shouldn t eat human food mine would not be so polite üòÇ
for the best place in the house you have to move the cat
little grey faced dog eyeing that unoccupied corner of the bed wondering if it s worth the risk
it s someone else s picture and your stealing for karma
look at the belly on that cat there used to be six dogs
this is why dog people are saints and cat people are monsters
for any other people out their that can‚Äôt auto covert in there head it‚Äôs fahrenheit
i believe the labrador is planning an overthrow with the assistance of the schnauzer

this pic warms my heart all the best for your family

jesus we were only in the hospital for two weeks after our youngest was born i can t imagine two and a half months just can t
my daughter was a weeker and is now and in everything good luck so cute
when i worked in s children‚Äôs hospital i would literally feel proud joy when the kiddos either went home or made significant progress i distinctly remember clapping like an idiot when i heard that one kid who had been in a very serious life threatening accident was moved from the picu to the progressive floor congrats op hope your baby has a happy healthy life
to me it looks like he is training to be the pope and is blessing everyone as he goes by in hi stroller popemobile
what a handsome little man so glad that you get to take him home what a cute little wave you caught too
omg congrats he s just the cutest i have a little premie myself and while we didn t need a nicu stay we did end up on the pediatric floor door two weeks i know how wonderful it is to be able to walk out those doors enjoy the fresh air side note those toys need to be taken off while in the car in a car accident they would become a projectile all the love and good wishes to your little family
this is awesome ü§ì i was a lb twin premie yrs ago it‚Äôs amazing what they can do now a days congratulations and good luck
i just want to say congrats to getting to leave with your child so adorable my wife and i were in the nicu with our daughter for days then she passed away i could not imagine the strength it took to be there for days so happy for you and hope everything continues to look up
man days in nicu seemed like hell earlier this year i can‚Äôt imagine what almost months could have been like hope everything is going well best of luck
holy shit i can t imagine what your bill is going to be like
congrats my son was in for if the hardest days of my life
yay we spent days in there and the nurses were like friends worst and best days of my life
yay as a former preemie myself i feel quite certain you‚Äôre gonna be a ok little one lt preemie power
love the little wave congrats to you and your family
it s a great feeling finally getting to leave the nicu we had a stay of days those ladies were a godsend tho not sure how we would have been able to do it without them
i m glad for you to finally take your little angel home this pic made me tear up and reminded me what s truly important badass strong motherfuckers that are doing their best every single day to make it happen sending little angels to their families i edited and deleted my post a few times because i don t want to be cringe self centered or being disrespectful towards your family and nicu nurses i m just happy that you and your family weathered the storm with some good people by your side
having been in the nicu as a infant the head nurse is still to this day a close fried to my mother
nicu baby chiming in lbs oz born with infection and brain bleeding that was in and now i ve got a toddler and another one on the way i spent months in the nicu and the docs let me go home a week earlier than planned since it was father s day and i was on track with gaining weight and other stats your little guy is a fighter
glad you re finally out days is a long time in the nicu my son was born at and was lbs oz we were able to get out after days with many ups and downs he s doing great now and is about months old now also the hospital you re in i am pretty sure it s the same one my son was at does the hospital name start with an e
my family is a nicu family days home healthy and full if joy years and still haven t found the words to show the love appericiation and gratitude we have for the nicu staff
i always hated to see and hear a child suffer but since i became a father it pains my heart tremendously and my eyes wells up now i m glad this lil fella is out and wish him the best üôÇ
my grandson was a nicu baby this tugs at my heartstrings congratulations on going home
my son was born with weeks last year although he hasn t been in nicu but in the high care unit those nurses are flipping awesome so much support and knowledge my son s doing absolutely great thanks to their initial care op all the love and joy for your little one bless
as a nicu kid now in college congratulations hope your child goes to live a long and happy life succeeding in their dreams
my son very healthy mo now spent days in the nicu due to a pneumothorax hole in one lung he was fine just needed a little extra support for his first week the nurses were amazing it was heart breaking the see the parents and babies that were in there for something actually serious there was a set of triplets in the nicu born a day after mine was stable but in an incubator the other were air lifted to spokane and the way the nurses talked they didn t think they were going to make it
one of my close friend s preemie lived in the nicu for months sadly she didn t make it but my friend is still in contact with some of the nicu nurses years later the support really helped her through her grieving process
i work at a children‚Äôs hospital inpatient pharmacy and nicu nurses are something else i see little lb babies that i‚Äôd never be able to fathom taking care of but nicu nurses do it like nothing
congrats its a long journey ahead but you got this my son was in the nicu for days man it was a rough ride our prayers are with you and your family
i ve never met you and yet i love you enjoy your freedom
days thank god your baby is finally going home all better
my son spent days in the nicu as well they are a blessing there
much floof good kitty may he get all the good treats
i am not a cat person but for whatever reason i am drawn to old cats my girlfriend has a year old cat named leo and i adore that little old man and his raspy meow there is just something about him
lily looks just like my boy merlin does she have blue eyes by any chance i miss him something awful but if her personality is anything like his you are one lucky person best kitties
cat on the counter ugh fucking gross maybe i can come over sometime i just stepped in dog shit and would love to stand on your kitchen table
did she jump up on that counter how does age affect ones hoppys
my old girl is too she cant hear but still see good your floofer is adorable lt
our year old one eyed cat is also mysteriously summoned whenever we are having chicken she absolutely loves chicken
i‚Äôd hear the chicken slap agisnt that counter top then come running
same here my cat is can t see too well and it almost completely deaf but comes a runnin when can of tuna is opened
she hunted it tracked it down now you must give it to her
that baby is older than i am and you better give her all of the snuggles and kisses she desires
you re lucky my grandfather can t see or hear to well either and he smells terrible
weird it s usually the black cats that come running when they smell chicken
there is no cat no dog that will ever ignore the smell of cooking chicken
this is why you don t eat homemade food at other people s houses the lid is on the counter same as the cat what else has the cat been on or shared the same surface as
and she can still jump on the counter that s pretty amazing
beautiful cat one of my cats is also named lily by the way
i m old af and never realized till today that cats live this long
i can t even get my cat to eat a can of tuna and yours is trying to eat some ramen üôÑüòÇ
those paws from the kitty litter tray ‚Ä¶ to your food they are the paws of destiny‚Ä¶ or at least some serious runs later on
put of of my cats love people food i have to eat like i m in a prison cafeteria i don t mind their mouths in my food but once they paw something it is theirs
first of all people that s not sushi it s kimbap it definitely tastes different from sushi and i know koreans often eat it with korean style instant ramen just saying
i have a husky with blue eyes as well and man sometimes it just feels like he looks directly into your soul with those piercing light blue daggers
i ll cut you one day steve and you won t even know it was going to be that day when you brush your teeth in the morning
huskies do have the best painted on faces husky puppies always somehow look pissed off
he looks like he just looked at some texts you forgot to delete
the suspense is killing me mom dad how did the book end did the good boys win against the evil cat masterminds
‚Äúhe didn‚Äôt you‚Äôre kidding me ‚Äù dog after owner tells a story about bob at work
it puts the treats in the mouths or else it gets the bites again
kinda looks like he s constipated and pushing really hard
was able to confirm yesterday due to a worried fellow commuter on facebook that she has a home nearby and just joins us for the love
i m picturing adoration from a few shepherds or three wise men bearing gifts
does she have an owner or is she just a station cat
she is gorgeous and i am so jealous you get to meet her
i love when they neatly tuck their tails around their feet
yes love her she‚Äôs super into lap cuddles which can be awkward if you just squatted down and now have to give up on being on time for work worth it
sitting patiently on her throne the queen in all her effortless majesty graciously accept the compliments and presents from her loving subjects
i want to take her home where is this i see your name is canadian you wouldn t be living in ontario would you more specifically closer to niagara falls
i would gladly get in a queue to pet this cutie the cat is beautiful üß°üêàüñ§
if people are lining up to pet them you should charge admission üòÜ
she s also known to claim backpacks as her perch as soon as you put them down for whatever reason so you end up missing your train because you wouldn t dare to disturb her of course
i wish eindhoven train station bike parking had a kitty so darn cute
imagine that s the bike of the owner it simply protects against theft
gt train station bike parking knew it had to be the netherlands
i have the same cat little more black on the face but everything else is spot on
i love the ears ‚Äúand here we go stop turn move again stop wait like a good boy on the move again ‚Äù
if it was my dog she would be trying to play fetch with the gun
my dog can t even avoid stepping in his own shit when he s done half the time and this one s fighting a damn war like a medal of honor recipient
i love how happy good boi looks i hope a treat came his way
wow holy crap that dog is fixated not on the owner but on what he is supposed to do that is incredibly impressive
dogs wanna be dogs i dont like this i couldn t willingly put an animal in harm way
that s a really good boy who s a good boy he s a good boy yes he us yes he is goodest boy
fire one live rund whit ur dog that cloas to the mussle i dear you then you have a show id watch
what exactly is the dog used for isnt it a bit dangerous to use a dog in a gunfight
geez we re not content with sending people to die and kill in war we also have to send dogs
honestly this looks like having the best pupper as nothing more than a shield
oh i m sure this thread will go wonderfully on not get locked
dog must always be in position for tactical petting
i wanna be a military cop just to have a cool dog and help people i can be many things i love life
goes what would happen if that gun was fired poor doggo that s going do hurt his ears so much or are there dog earplugs
impressive and all but what exactly is the dog doing it looks like it s a bullet shield i hope that s not the role
if i do this will i get pets if i do this will i get pets
if someone had a gun you would probably do as they say too right haha jk its amazing what we can teach animals
does really dogs take this things as a responsability and kinda feel they‚Äôre doing something important or is it just fun and games for them
the dog may be thinking man i m part of something bigger than myself so he s truly committed
dog when the soldier told him to stay lovely day out here oh look who made it nice to see you patrice ok back to work
why doesn t the dog get a gun isn t he allowed to defend himself
watched john wick parabellum yesterday combat dogs are unreal it was so freaking awesome
i wish dogmeat fallout moved along with me like this
kinda wonder how animals feel about training you can t tell them that you re training them for a dangerous situation so day on the job must be a real shock to the system
and i can t even stop my puppy from biting the shit out of me right now
thats where shepards really excel they re so vigilant and always alert it s amazing but you have to give them something to do that s why you hear so many horror stories about them that s usually people that don t give them something to be vigilant about
i can t even teach my dog to stop walking when he shit
how is training dogs to be militarily useful aww when the trainer unleashes the dog on drug traffickers or insurgents or protesters is that aww bizarre sub
and then there‚Äôs my dog starting to bark at a lemon laying on the table all day long and random running around because she is too excited for her food
gotta be honest that s some cruel shit to do to a dog
that dog thinks it s having fun but then imagine putting it in an actual combat scenario
i ve seen that kind of stuff live and i have to say it s really impressive especially the dogs obedience and the way they stand the sound of gunfire without flinching whatsoever
anyone see parabellum yet if you like this go watch john wick
go move stop move right stop turn look left squirrel short pause go lay down stay come squirrel short pause
if you look at how the dog is starting towards the eyes of the human there‚Äôs a lot of physical anthropology that shows exactly why this is mans best friend let me elaborate at the beginning of our shift from being a more ancient hominid to today‚Äôs ‚Äúmillion dollar man‚Äù all started with communication and the most important form of survival communication is silent messaging this will allow for multiple nuances say avoiding detection or coordinating hunting amoung others as hominid developed having visible whites on the side of the eyes actually became a permeated trait another animal that developed an ability to communicate through silent visual cues were wolves later dogs through distinct pupillary colorization this is what led to an ability for both species to ‚Äúcommunicate‚Äù through their specific ocular evolution and later intertwine successfully if i missed anything let me know potatoes
so basically the dog is shielding the soldier from bullets smart but also sad
not so great when a dog‚Äôs hearing is super sensitive and the gun goes off a foot away from their head
that s cool and all but we have drones of all sizes and shit don t put doggo in danger
this has to be chile only on wea republic you find this
is their a word for tears of sadness and joy all at once
man that comfort dog has probably seen a lot of dogs for the last time tough job
seems risky to put a dog with not just one but many unrelated sick doggos
a few vets i have been too do this one was with a stray cat they found ‚ô•Ô∏è
wish i had a comfort dog at my work i m pretty sick dawg
can people be done with posting this now its been posted like a billion times it s not even true
i m sure there s a cat version but at the end everyone feels good and then the human looks around and has to clean up three piles of cat barf
hey i m like that guy hey but i don t have a doggo guess i ll die
i needed this even on the shittiest of days i know i have my good boy waiting on me at home that is powerful stuff
one day the doggo dies and everything gets black again
in the beggining i thought he was turning himself into a panda
wow this made me tear up i need a pet again something fierce can‚Äôt wait until i live somewhere that i can properly house a dog cat üôÇ
does anyone have the remake where stereo love plays when he goes fully black
didn t expect my tears st the end bad days can be lessened with pets waiting for you at home pets and wine lots of wine
good boyes girls are healing springs that magically restore your hp mp and any status ailments
why was he nice to the guy who got slapped why should we rooting for that guy
if this was on early s youtube ‚Äútakes my pain away‚Äù by afi would be playing over it
g re at post probs th time seing it on my frontpage or smthing
important stuff get unself a doggo or a cat else u would be the one suicide at the final
i do this as often as i can but i have no doggo to support me
my niece yr old said an thas wa eye yew wish your germs after touching people
why would making other people happy make you sad i don‚Äôt get that completely opposite for me
isn t this video kind of racist everything bad is black now even mood
i was having an absolutely shitty day and then i saw this it made me so sad and happy at the same time wow amp x b i hope everyone here has a great day keep smiling amp x b
i thought he was going to jump off the bridge at the end this was a much better ending
i made a comic strip similar to this but the ending was different i like this one much more c
moral of the video amp x b black people can turn white if they get kisses from dogs
i love what they did with the symbolism a true life lesson
no change in the temperature of my heart after watching this rayciss cartoon
paging u vredditdownloader because not everbody i know wants to go on reddit to see one goddamned second clip
‚Äúsometimes i am the mess sometimes i am the broom on the hardest days i have to be both ‚Äù
no one is obligated to do this especially if you re hurting too take care of yourself or end up fully filled with darkness
i didn‚Äôt see the subreddit this was from so i assumed it was from dankmemes or something and was gonna end really darkly xd
but i always watch videos to halfway then stop why should i watch the whole thing
looks almost like my cat s lost kitten but he has less brown of color
she hates being on her back and later when she‚Äôs full sized she‚Äôs gonna make you pay with her claws
does anyone else feel like you want to squeeze her to get out more of those cute mews
‚Äúhuman there is important exploring for me to do there will be plenty of time for snuggles later ok ‚Äù
this made my cat v concerned that i was hiding a kitten in my coffee mug
my problem with kittens is that they are so cute i m afraid i might cuddle the life out of it
awhhh cute tiny cat but also put her down out of your hand
idk why this reminded me of baby dinosaur hatching scene in jurassic park maybe its the sound
that is one of the most adorable things i have ever seen
i m picturing that kitten as stewie from family guy yelling at his mom
it s very sweet however i do hope it is still with its mommy i see many kittens here that got a new family but seem way to young to be taken away from their mother and it worries me eight weeks at the earliest preferably give them some more time with mom to learn cat skills of course it is different when you find a stray all by itself
there s not a soul on the planet that doesn t want to hold that adorable fuck
and my male cat just came running into the room lol
my male cat became extremely interested in my phone after the second mew i showed him the video and he tried to sniff the phone
if you or your anyone you know is contemplating of suicide show them this video it cures all depression
i could look at that cute face all day and never get bored
oh my goodness that s a seriously chilled out cat and what a beauty üòçüòçüòç
tens of millions of americans in debt upvote cat ultrasound
with two people holding her down i m guessing she is planning who she is going to kill first she s just getting her claws ready
more like if i weren t being restrained this is what i d be doing to your eyeballs
i wanna see the little kittens in the ultrasound pic lt
were they curious to find the sex of the kitten this is the most wasteful thing i have ever seen an ultrasound for a cat
i took a very pregnant cat to the vets the other day i was proving to the owner that she was pregnant it took three people holding her down and a cone on her head to discover she had teeny little kitties inside her this cat doesn t give a shiiiiit
that‚Äôs adorable one thing i‚Äôve noticed about rabbits is that they seem to dislike hopping on wooden floor my own rabbits do this and the rabbit in this video does so too anyone know why any useful answers would be appreciated üòÅ
bunny wanted to enjoy its ill gotten treat with its buddy d i stoled us the trea oh you stoled one too den dis mine
he looks like that when he steals my damn vegetables
gt eating watermelon in front of a mirror your rabbit has an eating disorder
a mirror helps single rabbits to feel less lonely remember they are very social animals and can suffer from depression when held without a mate
and i‚Äôm here getting anxious from the watermelon juices going in the carpet mat
so cuuuuuuuuuuute have a gold as compensation for the stolen watermelon
people like to say cats are assholes they never had a rabbit before cats shows gratitude at times but bunnies they are just cute fuffy asshats that understand your kindness as his god given rights and as a sign that they are the chief and you are the slave
it s probably just me but it looks like at some point he is trying to share the watermelon with himself in the mirror i know it s probably not true but i laughed also it s cute
that‚Äôs no ordinary rabbit that‚Äôs the most foul cruel and bad tempered rabbit you ever set yes on
totes adorbs my cat does the same thing when i pretend to throw his mini tennis ball
i ll play along for now so this idiot doesn t know i m banging his wife cat probably
based on my experience with cats there is about mn before it attacks the hand directly
right about this point most cats would just flip out and have a conniption fit
i am the dog am in the pool the water feel so nice n cool when suddenly to my surprise my booty float begin to rise am much relax it bring me joy as i become the goodest bouy
further evidence that corgi butts are the cutest butts
someone get this pup a fit tea sponsorship and instagram influencer status
all i‚Äôm imagining is a soggy loaf of perfectly toasted bread üò≠
i allways was dreaming of this kind of dog they are really cute and cool
buoy buddy‚Äôs brewin‚Äô a big ol‚Äô blast behind that buoyant booty
i m trying to go diving but i m d u m m y t h i c c and the buoyancy of my asscheeks keeps me on the surface
too bad he didn t let out a toot then sink that would be high quality aww there
mfw when i jump in the pool and a ton of air gets stuck in my swim trunks
damn that bitch s ass is so big you can use it for a flotation device
that confirms it fat floats onnwater how his fluffy butt and head are over water is adorable
hnng i d love to swim around but i m too dummy thicc and the buoyancy of my asscheeks keeps lifting my legs to high
i would run away if i were you that thing about to explode every second
corgis are cute and all but what is it with people and corgi butts if people talked about any other dog s ass it d be weird but people talk and enjoy corgi butts it s really weird and slightly disturbing
they missed a golden opportunity for the title to be bubble butt
aww butt dog is all ‚Äúhi ho am butt dog doin a float everything is cool üôÇ‚Äù
just watch out for emergency venting of the ballast
hnngggg human i m trying to swim around but i m dummy thicc and the mass of my asscheeks keeps pulling me up
that s what happens to my butt in the water too only mine doesn t look as cute
i like pizza might like pepperoni plant where do you buy these
i m glad he chose your balcony i personally love pigeons but from what i understand not everyone does viva la rock dove
take photo of baby pigeon i swear they don t exist never seen one before
here the fact is that mango on left is sweating rather than on right
you might get confused and eat the bird then cage the mango
pick the second one it looks more ripe and would definitely go better in a smoothie
omgosh the bird is so pretty ive never seen a budgie that colour before
are mangoes called mangoes because they look like mangoes or are mangoes called mangoes because they look like mangoes
hmm one is not like the other i think it s the one on the left
i don t know one of those mangoes is looking at me funny
the one on the right appears to be pining for the fjords
i think mango would be a perfect name for this cute little bird
this dude just took a picture of two mangos i see no bird
i can t be positive but im like sure that mango on the right is actually a bird
send her to me so that i can check that she did in my hand
such a sweet kitty i love how big the paws look compared to the rest of her body lt
beautiful potty reminds me of mine when she was a pup
did he just come up and say yeah like a normal preson
hello conveniently placed gmc logo nice to meet you too
"slaps tale gate
‚Äúthis baby‚Äôs got one pupper in it‚Äù
boink"
i hate seeing dogs riding in the bed of a truck they need to be in the cab
fresno ahh miss my old stomping grounds no i wasn t a bulldog or a blood or a peckerwood or a cryp we had a gang problem
you must pay the tailgate borker a fee before you can pass
just a friendly reminder please secure your dog while in the back of the truck
a pit bull riding in the bed of a gmc how much more american can it get
his little ear twitch when he plops up be still my beating heart
can t be the only one expecting a big fucking spider to be nestled under that door handle glad it was a pupper
how about that for a little ray of sunshine in your morning
please don‚Äôt crop his ears please don‚Äôt crop his ears please don‚Äôt crop his ears ü§û
ladies and gentlemen i give you the latest in gmc technology rooftooth compatible
coming from the front page i was fully expecting that gif of the huge spider coming out of the tail gate handle
i was expecting something cute but i was not ready for this
shoutout to fresno not always the best place but it s alright
it s an old repost but the puppy is so cute i will let it slide
i always see stuff with animals and never say awww but this got me
more propagandawww great and shit let s add more murder machine puppies into the world it s not like the shelters aren t already overflowing with them
it looks like a doggie puppet on the end of someone‚Äôs arm
tesla needs to add this as a feature to their new pickup every truck comes with a puppy
aw man now i m so clearly imagining the little pupper excitement semi bark that came with this amp x b mmmberf
get away from this truck do you want your face bitten off
i still don t understand how some things get k up votes
slaps roof of pickup truck this bad boy can fit so much good bois
vet tech here someone drove around town with their puppy in the bed of their pickup and it jumped out severe head trauma she survived but be careful
crackle dee dee i m the teller of treasures baubles beauties i can sort tripe from treasure let me see your belongings
‚Äúfresno nobody goes to fresno anymore ‚Äù johnny henshaw
ah i see you are from fresno as well a man of the sjm
alright who else expected to see a giant spider come out from under the handle nice surprise though
"sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
cute"
this guy is very brave for handling a pitbull also smart to use a barrier because they bite off people s limbs you guys think they re cute but that s how they gain your trust then once you think everything is going great bam right arm gone when you let them near your jesus fearing kids kapow little forrest is missing is left leg
i was expecting a python due to your name equally as happy for pupper
awww it s too cute but it ll grow up and kill more children than a democrat tinder wh re
this is like when gizmo pops out of his box in the first movie
hot desert sun black truck no shade little puppy yeah way cute ü§¨
i ve been watching and squealing for the last minutes too much cuteness
needs the bass boosted clip of shrek s oh hello there
ah it s about time it s made it s secind round on front page always happy to see them return
i‚Äôve watched so many commercials for the gmc sierra that i fully expected a showcase of the cars tailgate this was a refreshing change
pls dont put your dogs in the back of your truck when driving it is dangerous and if you get in a wreck they will almost certainly be killed
cute puppy but this scenario always turns my stomach ive not come across a single person whos given a thought to how hot a metal pickup bed and this ones black gets in the summer shouldnt have an animal back there to begin with
i wonder if it will do the whole twitchy thing if you scratch above its tail oh wait nevermind you might lose an arm
than the male was a lion and the female a tiger right
it s pretty much my favorite animal it s like a lion and a tiger mixed bred for its skills in magic
jesus i ve never seen a video of one before just pictures it s so surreal to see one moving around it looks so alien
my brain refuses to believe the size of this animal i‚Äôm more comfortable believing that‚Äôs just a small dude
stop messing with nature and that dude was making me uncomfortable so touchy
while impressive it‚Äôs the result of irresponsible breeding that will result in lots of problems for the animal it‚Äôs also immensely far which exacerbate those problems and speaks to the kind of people who would do this and to the kind of care it‚Äôs getting
it looks kind of slow and lumbering are lygers just as fast and athletic as a regular lion or tiger
i feel terrible looking at this because he does not look healthy
someone will ride that liger and wage war upon their enemy kingdom
i m sure this one is properly identified but too many people try to call all lion tiger hybrids ligers let tigons be tigons
you can see the joint issues yup great you have such a big cat such a shame she s going to have a lifetime of suffering because of it
would ride into battle on teh back of such an animal
it seems one of those special mounts you get with money in video games
this is not natural its a human caused race and would never appear in nature this race can t reproduce and this liger does not seem happy or healthy
good god that thing looks like it s half hippo half lion wtf
dis you know that ligers will die because they don‚Äôt ever stop growing their heart will give out how sad üò¢
that thing just ate like deer so this man could be close
holly shit i thought the guy was completely nude the tan shorts were difficult to see in the shadow
my god how much does that thing need to eat per day just to keep it from snacking on that guys torso how many pounds of meat must it take
the liger is awesome but the shirtless goofy dude gives me the creeps
i don t know if it s relevant to these cats but the way he keeps licking his nose makes me believe he s incredibly stressed and unwell
that s quite a bit bigger than either of the two ligers i ve seen
that s hercules i ve seen him in person at king richard s fair in carver mass he is on display on a stage with nothing between him and the audience after the show you can approach him and say hi he is a fantastic specimen if he stands on his hind legs he can look into a second story window search hercules liger on the web and there s lots of pictures and information
imagine being such a vain asshole that owning a regular old tiger or lion doesn t do it for you
i line cross with donkeys the rest shouldnt be done
cool i guess but man that thing just looks like it‚Äôs not supposed to exist
this guy looks like he chases bologna sandwiches all day
imagine how screwed he is if the citty goes hunting mode on him o
honestly that body it looks like a cow with a cats head and feet
soooo is the nd half of the clip when the guys tries to make a manticore with the liger
it looks sad c mon u can do other cool things with science than breeding animals that are not fully okay ya know what i mean
"lion father tiger mother liger
tiger father lion mother tigon"
cats are jerks he is probably really happy and nimble normally but putting on a sad show for the camera so that the man catches hellon reddit such a cat thing to do
cross breeding different animals to create a genetic nightmare should be considered animal cruelty same thing happened with pugs and look how miserable they look all the time
i hope that guy is foot tall because the liger is pretty scary to me it could fit four human heads in its mouth
the only way i d accept immortality is if i had an immortal liger with me
as far as i know they don t have the size inhibition gene that s a direct result of the lion and tiger genes mixing so over sized sloppy in pain
if this poor thing didn t look like it could barely hold itself up i would be tempted to ride it into battle
now that s a big chungus chunga chunga chunga chunga chunga
this should get downvoted just so breeders wont be motivated to keep doing this shit
that kitty could actually chew the guy s head in a single bite i guess
i ve never seen a cat that looked so much like a corgi
forgive me for sounding like that guy but this is not normal if somebody did this for the cool factor fuck them
i was wondering if that annoying guy in the back was wearing clothes or not glad he is
where did they find a tiny human that‚Äôs really a thing
it‚Äôs pretty much my favorite animal bred for its skills in magic
i wish something could be done to ease their suffering
dye his fur green with yellow stripes and ride him like he man
all i can see is a naked man hiding his shame behind the cat
this is one of the saddest stories i‚Äôve read we‚Äôre just creating these animals for fun fuck we suck as a species sometimes
always doubt did it this once and thought it would be cute to make it seem like this is his normal habit thats better
hmmm so do i maybe i‚Äôm part cat it would explain a lot
i couldn t help but notice the fc inter pillow in the back
i don‚Äôt want to be a downer but i heard once what if a cat puts its head down against something like that they may be in pain i hope it‚Äôs not true here just wanted you to know just in case
it looks like the kitty was walking along and then decided to take a nap but the ‚Äúnap‚Äù signal took a while to make it to the back end of the kitty so it kept walking for a little while after the front end had already stopped ‚ù§Ô∏è
in my experience cats only lie with the tops of their heads on the bottom like that when it s going to rain or snow
i‚Äôd fall asleep in weird positions too if i had to endure watching inter week in and week out
i just wanna give him a little nudge to help him out
i wish i could achieve cat levels of comfort when i sleep
i noticed from ultra sound pictures that this is the position they were while developing inside the mother i also noticed it with my little nephews ultra sounds pictures
what a little weirdo i wonder if he knows how cute he is i wouldn t put it past a cat to wonder how can i possibly be more cute in order to get all the treats and cuddles
i heard you might be getting antonio conte for next season
womb position all mammals do it to a certain degree yes even humans if you ever wondered why you wake up or feel comfortable in this strange position womb position
over the course of my life i have been privileged to have the company of more than twenty different cats in all that time not once have i ever seen one go full potato
because orange cat clearly they are the weirdest and smooshable of the weird
so no ones gonna talk about the pink lace in the back
well if this were my cat he would not get any sleep i would feel obligated to pick up this cuddly mass if fur every time
it was a funnier picture before i noticed the arm sticking out all i saw was a cocoon and a head
i too had a buddy named mo he s been gone a year now
if your cat likes to sleep with you i recommend getting a small bed for them to sleep in and putting it next to you my cat sleeps next to me every night now
this is mine and this is mine and this human is mine
does mo always bring connor mcgregor to bed with him
dude you are patrick gilmore you‚Äôre in the show travelers or you are someone who posted a picture of patrick gilmore and is claiming to be him either way im a big fan
love when they put their ice cold paws on your arm and steal your heat
stop using this subreddit to showcase your sos we get it they are hot and you are proud but this is the wrong place
that is clearly a pangolin egg make sure to take care of it or it won‚Äôt hatch
i saw my first baby pine cone last spring that and a baby pigeon i have seen it all
i saw my first baby pine cone last spring baby pine cone and baby pigeon i have seen it all
these cones make amazing jam it is necessary to grind and add sugar to the juice the bumps themselves do not eat only the juice it is very thick
may look cute but step on one of those things and you will curse their existence
you only think it s cute because you ve not swallowed one whole and had to suffer the pain of it leaving your body a few days later
ah i remember my friends and i going home with bruises from these in school pinecone fights got wild
awww you just made me love the words ‚Äòtiny pine cone‚Äô üíï
i was so worried about seeing a cowering dog afraid of being punished this is a million times cuter thank you for being a good dog owner
doggo ‚Äúwow that was exhausting could you get me a cookie ‚Äù
hahhahaahah and her cone right there next to her brilliant amp x b what a sweetheart
i do not care what that dog did if you do not rub that tummy you are monster rub her tummy damn you all
i once read a study that said dogs don‚Äôt actually have the capacity to feel guilt sorrow maybe but not guilt so any time they act pathetic it‚Äôs just to reduce your anger at them
if you look carefully both her middle fingers are up
that dog is displaying contrition and submission she is not smiling
yes i see the regret the regret that the nap is being interrupted
so here s the thing you made me hafta wear that heckin cone n since i got it off this was my first time here alone so next time it occurs to you to make me wear that thing just wanna leave a message of the wrath that i will bring
she is clearly showing that her paws are clean and that she has no worries about being convicted
boss you refill those yet nap time over back to work
omg it is hard to punish a puppy who acts like that at least he is sorry a cat would just look at you and ask you to clean it up and feed me kind of look
left alone bored she made a mess bfd so you just clean it up and figure out how to avoid it in future punishing a dog in a situation like this is a total negative for which the perpetrator ultimately will pay this sort of thing happens to dog owners she is not contrite she s forgotten all about it she s a dog after all being a dog people who cannot tolerate dog behavior are well advised not to have a dog bottom line you gotta be smarter than the dog also she s pretty adorable gotta say
i mean as long as your car is still clean it s not that big of a problem haha
that was happy baby pose if i‚Äôve ever seen it namaste
can you touch your toes hooman i thought not you can t judge me
she may feel somewhat bad about it but it doesn t mean she ruled out doing it again
perfectly timed fu i don t care what you think stretch right there
she didnt do it there is no dirt on those innocent paws must be another dog
mine got into carolina reapers i had in pots and destroyed them all a couple years ago i thought i was over it seeing this i realize i am not
this scene demands forensic investigation so much to unpack here i see a cone currently not on doggo i see a doggo wholly without any sense of guilt as the defendant s counselor i ask the jury to pay attention to the details of the case doggo has limited peripheral vision with cone obstruction engaged con obstruction tips planting soil which will cause master to be upset both potting soil and cone must be punished for upsetting master the dog just took care of business tore up the cone and then beat up the soil to punish it he did nothing wrong case closed move to acquit
there is no mess quite like that of a pet mess they really know how to strike for maximum coverage and annoyance
i can‚Äôt tell if that‚Äôs a submission pose of ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt kill me but if you have to here‚Äôs my belly ‚Äù or if that‚Äôs a dog that just doesn‚Äôt give a shit what you think lol
that s probably the most relaxed dog i ve ever seen
what a character i just choked on a laughing fit because i wasn t expecting that much groveling sooo funny
all in a day‚Äôs work my pooch is over and i‚Äôm still picking up toppled trash cans
i don t know how that happened i was napping here the entire time
owner cooper what did you do cooper look mommy i can touch my toes ü§ì
she‚Äôs grabbing her feet like the happy baby yoga position very proud of her work
it would appear that my dog broke into your house that s both her appearance and mo
that s the least guilty feeling dog i ve ever seen lol so relaxed and not panicked after the incident
that s the good just came off a hour flight this bed is too comfortable sleeping position
i pull that same stretch right after finishing a taco bowl
it seems to me she is resting after a day of hard work
looks to me like this dog was left alone locked in the garage and out of anxiety got into making a mess exercising a dog properly before leaving them alone would alleviate their need to get into mischief
nah that s a shameless dog look at her relaxing there xd
yip that‚Äôs a rottie source staring at my sweet derp faced rottie sleeping over lt ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî there
does she though i see a doggo who knows its person aha
i really wanna try this again sometime can you set up everything nicely again tomorrow
seems seems madame nay she is sorry saw the opportunity and i took it
so cute looks exactly like my mutt frankie he even lays just like that when he s happy what kind of doggo do you know
i see this and hear music throw your hands in the air like you just don t care
i came home this afternoon to find that one of my dogs completely shredded a cardboard box i can t tell which dog did it because all three are unrepentant assholes and no one had the guilty face none of them has ever done that before and i don t know why they would start now
was expecting the guilty dog face i love this animal
ofcourse it s a rottie stubborn and the dgaf attitude
why did you just have a bucket of dirt on the floor was there a plant in there or something
i f n love the foot grab as the camera pans to the doggo
i think you‚Äôre mistaken that there is a dog that don‚Äôt give af lol
oh my gosh hilarious what a girl not a care in the world
she was working so hard she needed a nap to recover üòú
lol she looks like she s in absolute agony over what she did
lol is the tube supposed to prevent from licking that looks like one mad floofer
all i could picture is that damned roomba screaming obscenities every time it bumped into that piece of furniture xd
this is the most precious cat video i have ever seen
my cat would literally be doing backflips trying to get that tube off her neck how on earth is it tolerating that
this was filmed inside an airport that cat is clearly off on holiday
that s a really clean and shiny floor too me a moment to realize the cats reflection wasn t a small pile of fur
questions what vacuum is that and why is your cat in a pool toy
i‚Äôd quit my job for that lil face but then beg for it back once i remember that lil face needs feeding
i see your cat has the blessing of extremely cute cat eyes very unlucky mine has them too and all they will do is put you under a spell
awwwww i would stay forever if my cat did that hahahaha
omg full on puss in boots style ü•∫ cutest thing i‚Äôve ever seen
i would sometimes leave the radio on make her think she‚Äôs not alone
its not hard for me to leave for work when my cat is convinced its meowmeowmeow play with me mode at am
my cats broke a glass this morning and i currently hate them my wife will not be pleased that her vintage glass was destroyed
mine just go back to sleep once everyone leaves for work they actually get annoyed if i don t get up and leave because she wants the bed i have likes using feet as pillows and the other one wants my pillow
then don t leave for work nobody is verbally forcing you to yet
one time i called in sick just because my cat looked sad as i was leaving
this locks like my cat his name is snuggle but in swissgerman and he always drools and likes to leave his hair all over the place
you have to turn around and give kitty one last head scritch and belly rub
i train mine giving her a cookie before i leave the apartment but that carries new responsibilities tough
this is a repost which i would be fine with if you didn‚Äôt try selling it as your own cat
oh my lanta that is such a sweet face give her some pats for me please
i miss my cat when i see this pic i had to give her away since im moving overseas
omg your cat is my cat‚Äôs twin even down to the posing
one of mine flops down at my feet with her chunky polka dotted belly up i stop for pets but unfortunately their cuteness doesn‚Äôt pay the bills
i ve never been able to catch my dog in a picture with his eyes closed as soon as he feels eyes on him he cracks it open to see what i want which is his eyes closed
i wish all naps came with a puppie and a large fluffy cuddler
i don‚Äôt know if i should be jealous of her or the dogs ü§î
every single one of them looks so comfortable i dream of being this comfy one day
that‚Äôs one comfy nap there having what a great picture you have taken
i also sleep on my girls booty well ex but still counts
the patch on her head almost matches his fur the prophecy of extreme cuteness has been fulfilled
some cats people are just waiting for their purpose darla has finally found hers
darla looks so very much like my cat spot who was named for the patch on her head
oh please keep them together little man unlocked the happy
this is what i needed to see today ty i have a cat that is yo and found out some not so good news recently my gf and i are getting a kitten soon and hope she will take to it like yours did
i had a tabby that had that exact orange bleach spot on her head she was a badass and also not the most affectionate i saw you re on the fence about keeping it i gotta tell ya the jump from is not really noticeable we have now and its much like having
like someone posted that kitten has found her you don t choose your cat they choose you üòç
i wish my older cat can accept our kitten like that and we had her now for almost months
still not convinced this is true i need more photos to analyze
my cat is probably the least social of any on the planet i open the front door to let her explore outside and she flees under the bed in fear
whatever you do don‚Äôt ever get rid of goldie maybe being a mom will break her out of her shell i think it‚Äôs fantastic that she has made that darling little kitty her ‚Äòpet project‚Äô pun intended keep us posted pls
how those eyes stretch out a little as he lunges forward adorbs

mothers coexisting regardless of species now if only us humans could follow with our own species
i love how cats will share mom duties with other cats and sharing with a dog is just a new level of awww
if it s his dog why is he keeping them out in the cold
hard to feel good about this knowing there s a dog living outside in a doghouse with a litter of puppies
yeah that‚Äôs cute buy why didn‚Äôt the asshole just let his pregnant dog inside god damn americans and the shitty way they treat dogs
i mean great but why the fuck does your dog live outside
you sick man i m mekting why have you done this to us its too much
i feel sorry for the poor dog and cat outside in the rain at a time when they really need help bring them in and make sure they are safe and warm
this is adorable but anyone else think those captions are a little cringey
okay but why aren t your animals spayed why are they all pregnant and whether the dog chose to go outside with her pups or not they should have a shelter big enough to fit them all these posts drive me nuts such bad pet owners getting such positive attention for being irresponsible
i wish the animals were not out in the cold and rain
this looks an awful lot like my cat that was found with a new litter
while this is adorable why the fuck wont people just spray and neuter their pets for fucks sake also why is he keeping them out in the cold
that cat would be big ball of knots if it ever spent more than microseconds in my vacinity üòì
this is the most adorable mop with eyeballs ive ever seen
when i first watched it i thought the cat was sitting on his own hair like he just got combed then i realized it was just the blanket
not knowing whats going on in the background i m choosing to believe this is filmed in some sort of sick cat scratching post tree house
the term floof gets thrown around a lot these days it s almost lost all meaning however if you look in the oxford dictionary for the word floof there is a picture of this cat next to the definition
andy warhol‚Äôs wig i can say this without regret because i have a white persian cat too
the chihuahua equvalent of the cat world is these cats with the punched in faces
masters of horror episode named jennifer all i could think of
i m telling you that cover probably wasn t that furry before the cat got up there
this cat looks fake like i know its a real cat but i would think its fake if this was a picture
i can only imagine that bad is made from it s own furr as well as the pelts of its enemies
i think the eyes took some mass from the ears so it has big eyes tiny ears
if i ever doubted cats are an alien species sent to earth for world domination i would like to state i no longer doubt that i love this cat it‚Äôs fluffy as hell it looks so nice but the eyes they‚Äôre so big like a pugs but way less derpy i still want this cat i‚Äôm ok with the whole alien cats and world domination thing they‚Äôre probably planing
how the hell is the cat so calm what did ya feed it temme so that bathing my cat would be an equally peaceful experience
why do people bathe their cats it s bizarre to type this but cats are self cleaning
cpt turn off the water when you wash your kitty the sound of the water scares them the most
as an chinese i know this dish very well hit me up if u need some tips
is that some fucked up joke jonathan do you see me laughing
unless they get into something very stinky cats don‚Äôt need baths
karen honey listen i know messed up but you don t have to do this
i should probably be a vegetarian i haven t eaten mammals in a couple years but i need to go all out poverty is a bummer i wish i was fusion powered and didn t have to eat

bruh everyone here is like ¬´¬†o mal god ar yu beeng rasicte ¬ª like fucking chill it‚Äôs a joke
my cat would just rip my arm apart if i tried to dive him a bath haha
i have never seen a kitchen sink with an overflow drain before
why would you bathe your cat unless sprayed by a skunk there‚Äôs almost no conceivable reason for this
please don‚Äôt bathe your cats it‚Äôs very stressful for themüò¢
i grew up on a farm we had between and cats throughout my entire life and i ve never ever seen one of them get washed
ah yeah i went to the luck dragon panda last weekend great sesame chicken
omg you weigh your pet too we have a turtle that we have been weighing for years now started at g now just over kg we even made a graph
couldn t comprehend little fellas size until the hand came to give pets
proportions seem off even for a very very young kitten is this a munchkin cat takes the cuteness away if it is
soon you ll be looking at grams of cuteness they grow up so fast
anybody else notice the other one in the background at the end
why is this sped up give us more time to appreciate how cute this kitten is
stoo just stop supporting the breeding of munchkins there is a special place in hell for people who breed and support unhealthy animal breeds just because they are cute
let it keep going until it gets to my house it will get all the cuddles
grams i believe that is enough for intent to distribute
not good small deformed limbs cause of excessive breeding and modifications with those little stubs you get limited blood flow and joint pain all around this shit is not cute
the cuteness is unreal how could something so small even exist afdasfdhsxjgcgh
sooo cute d and that little ‚Äústank face‚Äù at the end haha
i d be very concerned if that kitten only weighed g my hand rear was g at birth and as this kitten has his eyes open it s roughly to days old
hello it‚Äôs the dea just a few questions about this grams of cuteness you seem to be possessing
the thing is if i had a little kitten like this or a small baby bunny this size i would just lay down and put it on my face and just play around the whole day just wasting time would love to foster one though
i put more grams of mortadella in my sandwiches than this cat weighs
awwwwwwwww so cute who ordered the smol flavored cuteness
are munchkin i hope no what kind of bastard would breed munchkin
the metric system for the win that‚Äôs how we will convert the heathens via kittens on the internets
i needed to kill a bear with my own bare hands to feel masculine again
i‚Äôd rather blaze grams of primo hash you can‚Äôt even smoke kittens you fuckin nerds
i cannot get over how little this guy is he s so cute my guinea pig is literally like nine times the weight of this kitten and yet would still be absolutely terrified by him hahaha
if funko pop figures were alive would look like this
i would like to disclaim that i am not the owner of the video nor the kittens but i thought id share to make someone‚Äôs day better
anyone else hear tiny little mew mews in their head when watching this
i recently got kittens they weighed grams hours after birth eyes open walking fairly steadily like this little one means at least week old and grams
grams because calling it a quarter pounder could give people the wrong idea
it s videos like this that are so cute and adorable that they almost make me cry not even joking
is it uncut or is it mixed with sugar and spice and everything nice
i think you mean pounds we don t use communist units here
good lord how can it be this cute how could anyone be cruel to such lovely creatures
are those baby russian blues if not what breed are they so cute
you mean grams of cuteness because of the little baby in the back
these babies look just like two kittens i raised üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è
yeah i only speak freedom real measurement s cute cat though
tho is cute but wasn t it just posted a few weeks ago
i usually scroll past most cats thinking ‚Äúcute‚Äù this one i can‚Äôt handle thinking ‚Äúomfg kill me because my heart is hurting so bad this is cute af ‚Äù
aaahhhhh i can‚Äôt handle the cuteness i need backup quick
if it was made of water i could drink it in a single gulp
awww who‚Äôs ur cuteness dealer i got grams of cuteness from mine back in september
oh goofff iehjiheieofh fhfhfnhnh cannnnn t tttyyppoiioeeee
ma it‚Äôs too bright and wobbly wait hold on kk i can do this
i love that mom is helping this is entirely too cute
elephants look completely developed from birth they literally only get bigger unlike many other animals
the foot nudge at the start like ‚Äúoi stand straight you little shite oh fine i‚Äôll help‚Äù
can you imagine if human‚Äôs newborns stand after labor shit will be out of silent hill
it‚Äôs an instinct for the baby to stand asap and for the herd well mainly the adult females to help it stand asap the longer the newborn is on the ground the longer it‚Äôs vulnerable to predators lots of noise plus bloody afterbirth predator red alert get up get moving
at lbs at birth african elephants are the second largest babies out of all land mammals right after game of thrones fans upset about the last season
breaks my heart knowing what people have done to these amazing creatures they possess every bit of emotional complexity depth and self awareness as any human in some cases they have those far in excess of what men possess elephants dolphins whales and the list goes on if there is a god we are all damned for whats happened to them unforgivable
user account created say ago front page in post karma farming account or just luck
that‚Äôs so absolutely adorable i hope no human ever hurts you or your family
that s how i feel i look when trying to get off the toilet after my legs have fallen asleep
it wouldn‚Äôt be an awww if the video started a few minutes earlier the bathtub of afterbirth from an elephants birth is kind of horrifying
can t help but imagine this happening with humans hnnnng ah there he his we will name him jeffrey jeff get dressed we are going to the grocery store your father is already in the car
head up you got to watch what‚Äôs in front of you are you even listening
aw i love the little fluffy ones so much they remind me of my old kitty when he was a tiny bean
it would be very hard to leave the house with that cutie around so sweet
is that a maine coon bb how adorable i miss mine being little bbs
ok that s it i m adopting another kitten this weekend
that s not a cute lady that s fluffious adorabolious the mightiest cuddlers of the cutious family they have the power to calm even the mightiest of beasts like a hooman who had a super frustrating day at work
this is why you dont teach your cat that hands are toys if you ever want to pet da tummy they cant think that hands are a toy or a threat
let s be honest he knows he s a king üòª he just lets you tell yourself he s not üòâ
let him have you not hear of the divine right of cats it s ordained that he is king
i m sure he is most animals like people need to know their safe and their basic needs to thrive being loving is skill atleast to me
that is going to be an interesting experience for someone
i was trying to figure out what was going on then i saw the tongs with food lol
this is cool and all but don t you have to report it to a bird watch thing just to confirm numbers or something
i wish someone would feed me like that when i look at them through their window
yeah so we are going to need constant updates on this
i was so excited for this until i saw the open window and feeding the wildlife please don t feed the wildlife
that look of ‚Äúi am kinda in an awkward spot here please don‚Äôt do anything i wouldn‚Äôt do like eat my eggs ‚Äù
ooooo how exciting when s the due date remindme weeks
everyone is asking for more videos and updates but i think you need to set up a live stream until the whole family leaves the nest
i‚Äôm so jealous i love birds of prey especially falcons and hawks they‚Äôre so cunning and efficient yet cute and fluffy
dont feed wildlife i‚Äôm stoked you are helping house a soon to be mother but don‚Äôt feed wildlife
there really is no need to feed it what a gorgeous bird seriously though don t feed it
do you buy special pants for your basketball sized nuts
falcon in the city prefering to rent an apartment over building their own nest d
not an expert but looks like a kestrel falcon anyways enjoy the view but the hatchlings will most likely squeak all day long asking for food as people said before don t feed them that s how we humans destroy natural behavior
joining the ‚Äúdon‚Äôt feed wildlife‚Äù parade because seriously just don‚Äôt it‚Äôs unnecessary and harmful to the wildlife in question
i love the intensity on her face when the camera comes around the window she‚Äôs not looking for a fight but she will fuck you up if you touch those eggs üòÜ
this is kestrel not falcon video was originally recorded in russia and put into our sub where did u get this without crosspost o o
super cool please stop feeding it though as many others have mentioned you are actually hurting the bird and species overall even though you are trying to do a nice thing
i‚Äôm incredibly surprised this animal took a food item that didn‚Äôt look like it‚Äôs natural prey until ripped apart of course
kestrel and don‚Äôt feed it leave it alone and let it do its wild things
had a dove by the kitchen window once with two eggs in a pot some time later i saw one chick in the morning another egg by the time i got back from work well i guess one of these birds came by x
since there won‚Äôt be an update from op and no credits are given anyone got a link to the original source
this dude is reposting this and posted it on like subs his profile description is ‚Äúfollow me and give me karma‚Äù screw this guy
well i don t trust this one bit but that s chicken so ok falcon probably
i certainly hope you keep us posted on this mama and her babies i would love to see babies
my favourite post of the month eggs that s a lot for a falcon we have four falcon species where i live in canada and they lay to eggs
do not hand feed birds of prey i know you want to help out but you re actually hurting the mama bird because she ll start relying on you instead of hunting
do you want an army of trained birds because this is how you get an army of trained birds
well that‚Äôs just about the cutest bird i‚Äôve ever seen
don‚Äôt fucking feed wildlife you‚Äôre doing them so much harm
crazy cool you should try setting up a camera to watch the falcons hatch
this might be bad but u should get one of those eggs and raise it as your own then you can call out to it and it would just perch on your shoulder you‚Äôd look like a total badass
hey it allot looks like you were outside where i use to live in southfield i use to always see falcons out there
lot of mistrust in those eyes probably for the best predator birds have to work pretty hard for their calories and we don t want them getting soft still rather then hop on the don t feed the wildlife train i d add that you re gonna have some dead chicks with that many eggs if you condition her too much and possibly anyways so get ready for that best to let nature take it s course though
i literally have a falcon in my window box nesting too
so one of those eggs will grow up to be the new captain america
that‚Äôs the equivalent of girls using their hair as a mustache
so fun fact they do this as a sort of safety blanket generally it‚Äôs when they‚Äôre nervous or anxious but sometimes they do it to soothe themselves to sleep
i saw a female show leopard do this sort of thing my son and i were at the zoo and there was a female snow leopard chasing her tail in slow motion i feel it was deliberate let me tell you why in a second once she delicately caught her tail between her teeth she took another slow circle and then laid down still holding her tail in the next enclosure over was a male snow leopard he was running a trench alongside the fence that separated them he raced back and forth without stopping without slowing i told my son what i thought the two of them were saying the female was saying in sort of a mae west voice i got somethin fuzzy the male was saying in a frantic voice oh baby oh baby oh baby
obligatory ‚Äúfinally a worthy opponent our battle will be legendary ‚Äù
proves all cats no matter how big are weirdos and adorable i love the faces and could see my house cats looking the same way
this is a very sad cat it s not cute that it s holding its tail like that it means it s sad stressed lonely suffering
its a good thing people don t have tails or we d have to put up with even more posturing amp childish behavior
typical every time an animal puts his tail in it s mouth it cute everyone is happy it gets views and upvotes but when i try to put my penis in my mouth everyone is grossed out all of a sudden
i bet they do that or else if the tail gets wet and they stumble around like a stegosaurus
while this adorable i agree this could also be a huge warning sign of captivity stress i love all live
i can see picking up the tail when over water he doesn t want his tail to drop momentarily while distracted and wind up with a sopping wet tail that will take four hours to dry clean and style properly what he needs is a nice long wrap like a shower cap so he doesn t have to keep cleaning and styling his tail fur every time he wants to attack something in the water
my fluffy cats keep doing this when my phone is dead or in another room
they‚Äôre so cute and derpy and floofy and i‚Äôd love to pet one if given the chance
you know if i had that luxurious a tail i d do that too
aww this pic reminded me of something my mom told me about myself she said when she or my dad would check on me after i went to sleep they d always find me with my hand down my pants holding my wang lol
hey sometimes you just gotta check if your ass is still attached
because other kitty tried to bites now i carries my tail so he can t snatch
if my cats tail was long enough she would go everywhere like this
my golden retriever tries to do this but he can never catch his tail lol
snow leopards sufficient reason for a tourist visit to kyrgyzstan probly but they have other neat stuff
i remember this scene from kung fu panda where po fights tai lung the buffed up snow leopard po puts tai lung s tail in his mouth when he s about to bite him and he winces did those bastards lie to us
the size difference is disconcerting are these in same photo a tiny adult amp a big adult
it does seem that i ve seen a lot of snow leopards doing this as opposed to the other big cats
or just one photo above the other in rectangular array no real overlap my vision is exotic even when wear my new prismatics for outdoors
ironically i have a dancing bear head cover on my driver
haha eff it i d give myself a par and call it a good round d
i tried to google dancing bears but i didn t like what i found
that is how people die stay away from mamma black bear
dance dance dakota dance all around the country store
op stopped recording when mama bear say him probably because he had to run for his friggin life
guinea pig looks scared ive never seen a guinea pig with any other expression on their face they are simple creatures
if the guinea pig did not want to be there it would not be they are neverous loving creatures that can run fast and even bite back this picture is quite exceptional as that is how some pigs do look when relaxed and you can see the cat protectively embracing the pig and the pig s hind legs comfortably resting on the cat s foot i used to bring my gp to a house with a cat and they did become friends so much so that my friends cat would willingly give up his favorite sofa spot to my gp while we visited
you want to join me and hermes for a little just friends spooning
i can relate i ve fallen asleep before holding a snack
snow white and the prince lived and reigned happily over that land many many years
i feel like we ve seen that backpack corgi before anyone agree i feel like it was another subway vid too
is this the backpack subway corgi from the other pictures how many backpack subway corgis are there
my god corgis are one of the cutest breeds of dog he s doin a heckin good read
what‚Äôs he listening to on the headphones while reading
i would hope that prince harry is reading to mas max üòÅüíô
and he‚Äôs reading harry potter üòç be still my beating heart
looks like pup is reading and owner is falling asleep
is this guy reading and listening to music at the same time
i am happily married but i d ask what he they were doing later
came for the lecherous ill take both comments reddit never disappoints
corgis are one of the smartest hearing dogs most people don t realize that they can heard cattle
it so irritating when someone is reading over your shoulder
for the love of god you re too slow hooman turn the page already
corgi hot guy with a luscious beard harry potter i‚Äôm hyperventilating
hey dude turn the page quick there s a spicy twist ahead
that dog has probably read more books than me this year
this guy knows all the tricks to get girl‚Äôs attention and he combined them
doggo just listening to the mad tunes on the ear buds
i wish i was this dog so i could watch my owner walk around the apartment naked
you know what s not aww filming random people on the subway
anyone know what dog carrier he s using i ve been looking for a forward facing backpack just like it
love it not sure if i rather be the human or the dog
is it me or does the person look like a certain member of uk royalty
honestly became one of my favorites on ig always thrilled for a new post
i really need to go back to nyc someday maxine is on my list of must sees and must pets and give ear scratches and say plenty of ridiculous ‚Äúoo‚Äôs a silly fluffy girl yes you are ‚Äù
meanwhile my cat spends most of the day on his ipad
little did his human know said pupper had already dogeared a few pages beforehand himself out of sheer interest
oh boy oh boy quick turn the page i want to know who s the good boy is
omg i saw her on the subway this week and it made my whole day she was in the backpack sleeping on her dad‚Äôs shoulder üò≠üò≠üò≠
i wonder if he is listening to the audiobook while reading because i would imagine music and reading don‚Äôt go together so well
that‚Äôs how it starts and the next thing you know he‚Äôs on his knee‚Äôs screaming at a half sunk statue of liberty
i m a big fan of this trend of seeing animals in backpacks portable puppers ftw
lol it stuffs its flipper in its mouth just like a human baby does with its hand all babies really are the same whatever species adorable
is this a live action version from mickey and the seal
this one of those moments when i am reminded that there are all kinds of weirdly wonderful animals in all different kinds of shapes and sizes
i‚Äôm crying it‚Äôs so cute and looks so much like a puppy can‚Äôt deal with it
it always helps to have a good deal around your tub
awww the water was massaging it such a cute sea pupper
i would like one of these baby manatees baby walruses penguins and anything else i can have in a backyard pool lol hell toss in a baby elephant perhaps a couple baby monkeys a unicorn and miniature donkey that‚Äôs all
fucked up this creature should be in the wild not in some moron s bath tub
how are people even getting such exotic animals as pets please direct me too where i can get one
what s the background behind why all these people have otters in their bathtub
isn t this the same seal pup that doesn t have ears the one that hugged the toy plush that looked like it
it s just a dog that lives under water i can t take it üò≠
ok am i the only one just learning that sea lions have claws
and now i know the answer to my kindergarten teacher‚Äôs question ‚Äúwhat do you want to be when you grow up ‚Äù
oh sure that s cute but when i try to cuddle and feed a baby everyone s like howd you get in here and why are you feeding them a bottle of whiskey ugh double standards
that s a farrah fawcett sized nippled on that bottle just sayin
so is that some kind of formula or did they milk a manatee
how do you guess afterwards which one had did get fed and which one didn t
while they re cute i can t help but think when i see this fuck seaworld
i know they live in the water but could they theoretically also live on land like seals
i love and i cannot stress this enough this squishy sea cow adorable little guys look at them
we have sea potatoes we have sea cucumbers what s next sea carrots
wow look at that baby manatee go really puts my girlfriend to shame
that most be some seriously nutritious substance i expected them to eat much more or maybe they feed them every hour i dunno jealous of that person s job though
thats the cutest fucking thing i ve ever seen in my entire life locks car
i kinda wish feeding my baby was more like that what cute little ugly sea cows
this makes me wonder how manatees survived for the past million years
you can say he could even serve a youthful porpoise
man people really forget that seaworld does the most conservation work of any sea organization
sea world more like abusing watch the documentary blackfish on netflix if you don‚Äôt believe me
this is the exact opposite of how my baby son takes a bottle
i noticed he s holding and restraining the little guy how does that work while they are being fed by their moms i guess they cant hold the pups still cant the pups hover swim
"my nam is manatee
it‚Äôs a catastrophe
i don‚Äôt want your tiddy
so get the heck off of me my nam is manatee
it‚Äôs all a calamity
i don‚Äôt need your crud
i am but a spud"
holy fucking god this is some fucking adorable shit
i just moved to florida and i am so finding out how i can volunteer for this they are adorable
so awesome but seems the bottles not very full is that all they eat in a feeding
too bad it didn t get to stay in the wild with it s mother i guess no money in that
how do you keep track of who you fed and who hasn‚Äôt been
captain america voice ‚Äúthis is what seaworld is supposed to be‚Äù
i honestly laughed when i saw that comically large feeding bottle i was expecting a small fish
fairly confident that dude is living his best life he has a manatee tattoo
for some reason i can t stand the way people say really really like she does it just gets under my skin i think they are trying to be cute or funny but i m not sure it just feels like real lame ass canned laughter sitcom dialog cute critters though
with this amount of love you d expect family guy to be at least enjoyable after macfarlane left
what do they call a baby manatee a muppy i feel like we need to know
now thats a job that would make you want to get out of bed in the morning for
boss in charge to the feeder‚Äôs co workers ‚Äúdon‚Äôt just sit there give that man a teet ‚Äù
awww look at those babies and their butt pancakes lt
barbara manatee you are the one for me one for me one for meee
except i would get into the water with the baby and snuggle with it instead of squishing baby against the wall of the tank and then i would snuggle the next one and the next one and the
manatees are awesome one time in florida i tried to smack some with my oar while kayaking i couldn‚Äôt catch any though they submerged too fast it would have been awesome to hit one right in the head
that doesn‚Äôt seem like a lot of milk for such a large baby
oh my god my heart can t take it they re like little loaves of sea bread
oh dear god i wish i could have a swimming pool full of these wonderful sea calves
i need this hoodie for one of my monsters also am in hoodie and comfortable
reminds me of adam sandler movie anger management where he designs clothes for fat cats lol
anytime i attempt to clothe my cat she goes limp and cannot bare to move i too need this hoodie
i bet the weight of the sweater just threw off the cat s balance now it s stuck like this
my cats freaks out anytime i put anything on them what is dis magic
does anyone else see the lambs head on the bottom half of its body
i m so sorry but i have to i m so sorry everyone but trayvon martin
i can assure you the my pup has made it quite clear that she does not prefer the hoodie except to tear apart eat then poop out
now i need a cat with an akatsuki suit called acatsuki
if tax collectors did it like this i wouldn t even mind
let‚Äôs see this one is for that new robe i‚Äôve been eyeing this one‚Äôs for the biggest bag of treats they‚Äôve got on chewy the possibilities are endless üòÅ
and i see you re getting your repost tax literally the exact same title
you should probably sit down there s something you need to know about your dog
i have one of the pink ones and i put googly eyes on it and we call her monika louwinsky i also can t spell it would appear
ours is called daisy when his battery runs low he sounds like hal ‚Äúdaisy daisyyy giiiiive meee your annnnswer dooooooooo ‚Äù
we called ours ike short for ike a roomba he was free on the side of the road just needed a new battery charging station
we call ours mr roombastic freaking love that thing except when he high centers on a floor lamp or gets himself stuck behind a door
yes they always belong in pairs that‚Äôs how i needed up with
oh my word how have you not used all your vacation days already you must have a will of iron
ran out of vacation days had to use maternity leave though i m not a woman
honestly at this point you may as well quit or get an at home job just so youll never have to leave this cutie
watch out if his face turns lighter its an indication of bad health
i saw a mug today that said ‚Äúi want to be a stay at home cat mom ‚Äù
this looks like a visual representation of a setup to a really bad joke
karen don t put the stemware in there karen kareeeennnn
the brains cat the brawn dog the two dumb friends who set of all the traps before the other two go in chickens
that‚Äôs them treaties right there peeps wait till she takes da bait then we strike
so the menu for dinner tonight we were wondering if that‚Äôs negotiable orrrrr also can the chickens sleepover tonight pleasssse
the dog looks upset the chickens look interested and the kitty looks pissed off and plotting something what are you cooking in front of them
aren t the chickens little red hens supposed to be grinding flour and baking bread while the rest of the farm watches
this picture never gets old gets me every time i see it
when you re playing outside with your friends but you get called in to eat
as the looked on they knew what fell fate had befallen poor wilbur
animal farm rebooted where legs are good legs baaaaaaad notice no legged sheep
this is seriously my dream life but seriously how does your dog leave the chickens alone
your labby is so beautiful they all are but labby especially
the best part about this picture is the kitty s belly always make me sensibly chuckle
we heard there was a princess and we re here to help
what is so interesting inside did the pigs learn to walk
when you open the treat cupboard but everyone is outside
cat ‚Äúi came here to fuck shit up and knock stuff off the counter and the counter is looking awfully clear ‚Äù
when your friends come over to see if you can play outside
let me introduce you to the gang cat plays the citar he s an existentialist
i love this pic thank you for sharing it it makes me happy just to look at it
the creatures outside looked from pig to man and from man to pig and from pig to man again but already it was impossible to say which was which
this is fantastic i can t even express how happy this makes me
"the gang you say cat charlie dog mac
two brainless chickens that are always together dee and dennis bonus dees a bird"
see how well we d get along without speciesist prejudice
me and the boys watching the spoons in the microwave sparking
just one question why the hell are those windows so clean
i m pretty sure they re watching a pig do some interesting stuff inside that house
where is frank amp x b dee on the left dennis in the middle and silly mac and charlie on the right frank s up to something
üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ not going lie the cat is the best part his expression
omg the bremen town musicians they forgot the horse and the cow
what an adventure they must be having i can‚Äôt wait to see it in theaters
the cat is charlie the dog is mac the birds are dee and dennis
is this cropped from a larger image it looks like there s a third hen to the right of the kitten
you left me outside with these peasants that cat probably
the thumbnail looks like it‚Äôs a white cat an orange hen and a starving kenyan kid
nor i said the cow nor i said the dog nor i said the pig oven opens and
kitty looks like a flasher amp the dog and chickens wanted to witness the reaction
this is the same group that hangs outside my window the best
donkey and rooster couldn t come instead rooster sent two of his groupies
annnnd as usual the cat is pulling off the coolest move
they came for the dishes they stayed for the kisses
i m concerned about the chickens too close to the cat
the he s staring upwards after he s just like carry me peasant
man this guy certainly gets home a lot on the same day wearing the same clothes and his dog jumps into his arms the exact same way hes done it the last times ive seen this on this sub amp x b op you are pathetic
is it just me or did the dog look a bit worried and then relieved
if the guy hadn‚Äôt picked him he would have keep going all the way to the sky
i work on garbage trucks all day and this just made my night
the dog right before landing in his arms had a oh shiiiiiit am i gonna make it moment lol
i love how his legs keep running until he is securely in his hooman‚Äôs arms ‚ò∫Ô∏è
did he just flutter jump like yoshi wrong reality bud
is this house dog and backwards hat man ordered from a catalogue called american dream
buddy you can t go flying off where people can see you we talked about this
that dog seems so satisfied with what he did i would carry him her until my feet fell off
holy shit when he is in the air he is stil runningüòÇ
i want someone to photoshop that dog to continue flying while the moon theme from the ducktales game starts playing
perfect landing defined here i bet doggo can make a pretty good pilot
there was zero question in that dog s mind that he would be caught
the dog was thinking i ll make to the car i can escape
at the end the tail was wagging so fast the camera couldn t catch it
i like how doggo s brain forgot to tell his her front legs stop running after hes been caught
this is the time i see this posted with some time in between and i still have no clue what s going on with this dog he just doesn t care about physics
for a second i got them backwards and thought the dog followed the rabbit around this is still really heckin cute but if you could get the dog to follow the rabbit that might break this website
your doggo is absolutely beautiful is she a border collie
your dog has prettier eyes than any dog or human i have ever seen
i really hope that ezri is named after the character on star trek ds but my heart melts regardless ‚ô°
those eyes are some game of thrones shit congrats on a beautiful fur family
after capybaras i think dogs are the most chill to other animal well domesticated dogs with humans training them to be chill anyways
i dont know much about dogs but love animals in general is there something wrong with his eyes
he licks his chops after sniffing the rabbit immediately after sniffing the rabbit just saying
this is exactly the kind of yard i would wander into while walking home from school when i was a little kid pet your dog pet your bunny ring your wind chime and book it before getting caught
what‚Äôs the best approach to getting multiple animals to hang out together my wife and i want like a disney princess yard once our girls are out of school we want a few different animals to all be friends and hangout
this dog looks like he is constantly surprised by the world
our bunnies only enjoy biting me when im in their way on the terrace
finally you have procured the chariot i deserve hooman ‚ò∫Ô∏è
i am the cat n this my gram she my favrit of the fam she likes to have me be her side when she gets up i get to ride some other cats may walk along but i ain t doin nothin wrong i like the way her go cart feels my gram the best cuz she got wheels
this is so pure probably makes your gran so happy easing her recovery
why didn t you blur out your cat s face i m sure he would like protection from online trolls too s
i love everything about this i m glad your grandma is out of the hospital and she has a cute little cat by her side
they‚Äôll soon be best friends may your grandma have a speedy recovery
i sprained my si joint once not recommended and before i got a cane i used a chair with felt pads to prop me up as i hobbled to the kitchen or bathroom and back to bed my cats took turns going for a ride each time i liked the company
from what i ve seen your grandma is safe from alligators bears and large dogs now
he is a ginger cat and doesn t even have a kitty soul he just wants to steal her soul when it is released from her mortal coil
technically it‚Äôs a rollator a sub type of walker happy she is out of the hospital and doing well
holy crap not to be mean or anything but what happened to her face
i think the cat thinks your grandma is its chauffeur
i just would like to say i love this cat this cat has such great ears and is doing a fantastic body guard job would recommend
i use a wheelchair when i went and stayed at my best friends house for a few days every time i got off a different chair or the couch or woke up from sleeping i had to move the cat off my chair i‚Äôve never really been around cats much and one of my only cats i‚Äôve spent time with used to attack me so every time i wanted to get up there would be a few minutes of me timidly trying to get the cat off my chair eventually learned a gentle tipping worked best sweet thing loved my sweaty butt cushion
i like that this cat like all others will always wear the expression of yeah i was going this way anyway
my grandma suffered from blacked out face syndrome too she fought it every step of the way but by the end we just didn t know who she was anymore
when you say my grandma don t you really mean me wearing something vaguely in the fashion of a grandma with my head photoshopped out
no no dis is cat stroller look i show you i sit see fwiw my cats were utterly fascinated by my daughter s baby stroller they loved taking naps in it
great going for grandma cat is a cutie may i make a suggestion as a geriatric specialist one is on the lookout for potential issues with the elderly population nice walker for grandma make sure the width is comfortable to her and that the brakes are easy to engage there is concern with her right foot a large number of senior falls are due to incorrect shoes and improper shoe size please check the laces on each shoe and ensure they do not come close to top of sole second she has what appears to be inch heel room in the right shoe this could cause a problem on some surfaces and increases an overall possibility the shoe may twist or come off causing a trip or fall for many changing the lace style can reduce heel slip there are several youtube videos that demonstrate alternative lace styles look for reducing heel space my best to grandma and her bodyguard
did cat get a bodyguard job or did grandma just get a chauffeur job
dude the way you drew over your grandma s face is scary should ve just put a cute sticker
what are they holding some kind of super advanced underwater selfie stick
you just became best something s not quite sure i really want to know what but i wish you both the best
aren‚Äôt they known for pulling regulators and hoses off
wolf eels are also super cuddly but people get scared of the giant sea snake that heading straight at you for pets sometimes
excuse me human you appear to have something on your face making it hard to breathe all this nice water let me assist you
i don‚Äôt dive how much danger is there for an animal like that to accidentally rip out the hose to the mouth piece when it‚Äôs that close
when you feel two hands on your shoulders but still feel something poking your backside
its trying to mount him that seal is trying to have sexual relations with that scuba diver
hooman do the bubble thing again do the bubbles yeeeahhh
is she a munchkin so adorable i had a napoleon and miss her so much give noodles lots of scritches from me
she s absolutely beautiful what a lovely moment she shared with you i m sure you ll have many happy years together
the grump to surpass grumpy cat i confer upon her the title big grump
she s so cute all the cats like her we had at the shelter had lots of problems with their teeth i hope you got them checked we take care of them and pay for the expensive extractions but not all shelters do
total munchkin i love their short legs and tiny feet ‚ô•Ô∏è
british dogs over ‚Äúall these foreigners coming in taking up our head scritches and belly rubs ‚Äú
her eyes are stunning what a beautiful girl you‚Äôre both lucky to have found each other
how much did it cost if i may ask thinking of bringing a cat i know
i really want to hear this story how did you find her how did you bring her over does she seem happier
those are some disney pixar like eyes little cutey with flippity floppy ears having a turkish background i d call him boncuk because his eyes glow like boncuks
turkish dog no not meant as insult that is what he really is a turkish dog reminds me when austin power says there you are the guy says do i know you austin replies no but you are there
love that smile and genuine happiness to have found you
you found a beautiful dog your so very kind happy trails together
cookbook review instructions unclear found dog in turkey
so expressive absolutely a beautiful pup congratulations on your fur baby
thank you for adopting her you‚Äôre wonderful i‚Äôve been to turkey a few times and the amount of stray cats and dogs i seen was heart breaking
i misread this as i found her in a turkey brought her back to uk
she looks so happy good on you for bringing her home
dog bilingual how does she understand your commands
she is such a foreigner that she can‚Äôt even stand up
i m sure it s not the last time you find her in turkey she ll probably get into the ham and the cheese too if you aren t careful
so great i live in turkey and there are so so many stray dogs in my neighbourhood that are all good doggos and deserve homes
i could not touch when mouth is open how can i know if it s not gonna swallow my hand
very clever because now she will lead you to the best doner kebab in town
i was under the impression you couldn‚Äôt import dogs into the uk because of rabies fears
her name better turkey or something relevant to the cooking of poultry
when the dogs eyes look away at your hand that is when you attack the stomach with the other hand
they don t have stray dogs in the uk this is the second foreign dog adoption i ve seen this week
you can tell just how sweet this pup is most dogs are scared and disoriented after anesthesia but she she still just wants to love everyone what a sweet pure soul
i was gonna question calling your dog pitiful but i learned something new today looks like a good girl
thought you wrote ‚Äúpitbull‚Äù and though man it must have been some anesthetic because it looks like a retriever now
my dog has to go in for dental cleaning on saturday and it always scares me when she goes under anesthesia this helps a bit to see your sweet dog after being under
how old is your sweet girl got an older girl myself and i m worried of the risks outweigh the benefits at this stage so glad yours is well and already feeling wiggly again
very cool dress is that an x files tattoo on your arm
i though taylor swift changed her hair color in other word you look like taylor swift in other word taylor swift is hot
love it may the reddit community ask what grade s you teach art to
there s another member who does this it s a really great idea definitely something to cherish
i did something similar with a white hoodie in high school i just gave the hoodie to friends with markers in the pockets and told them to give it back later after days all my markers were stolen a few good pictures mostly just really dumb stuff girls phone number who i would later lose my virginity to and a few rainbows i once heard a few people question my sexuality because of those rainbows they didn t know i paused my headphones and could hear them i actually just threw it away a few months ago it had turned yellowish i guess from just being old
i swear i ve seen this before did you previously post this
i ve got my year s halfway through an enormous classroom tree maybe we should draw all over it instead of painting it
this is a really sweet idea the dress looks great also you are stunning and i love your haircut
lovely thought lovely dress and lovely teacher thanks for sharing
shoutouts to all the people remembering their cool art teachers right now as well this was cool to see and keep up the good work
as a former kid i refuse to believe those clouds on the butt were not intended as fart clouds
that s a really cool idea who knows you may inspire someone to go into fashion design
is this the art teacher who‚Äôs moron husband cheated on her again
awesome dress awesome x files tattoo you seem like the coolest art teacher ever
just spotted a canadian ninja turtle props to the kid who drew it
i‚Äôll bet after reading all these comments op will just post a pic of the dress next time
a fox mulder tattoo this might be my dream girl right here
hey if you ever see a student you re interested in just go ahead and bang him you re one of those teachers no oe would care they d just be high diving him
if my teacher looked like this it would be pleasure to go to school
your face sort of looks like mine lol anyway cute idea love the dress
my art teacher used to let me draw on her dress after class those were the days
you should put a year challenge out there for the kids top grade gets to design your next tattoo
you look exactly like elizabeth from bioshock infinite
all these i see posted i hope in years all of them have updates with the teacher wearing them at the kids high school graduationüòÅ
this actually looks dope and would be sold for usd at like urban outfitters or something
i‚Äôm pretty sure that is the exact same drawing i did of a ninja turtle
you look like a super cool bad ass barbie in a respectful way such a cute dress
plot twist she is not a teacher but rather a kidnapper
i hope you weren‚Äôt wearing it when they drew on it lol
are you also recently divorced like the other teacher who did this and posted it here
turned out great how do you protect the art on it from like washing and general wear also gorgeous teacher
i m just here to gawk at the spectacular x files tattoo upboat for nerdy teachers
that s a really neat idea but that agent mulder tattoo is the star of this image
your pupils have their first wet dreams about you for sure
lol you look very alike to my girlfriend who was a art teacher colorfull hair make up and hair style unfortunately she couldn t stand the poor salary bad behaviour of students and stress so she quits this is the education market and brazil i hope you get all the joy and pride in teaching and keep up with the good work
by chance was your mother an art teacher also you remind me of my high school art teacher
this is so cool i went to school for art and that was because of my art teacher keep up the super cool work awesome dress
she s got the x files tattoo happening but to be honest she looks young enough to have not been born before it finished
"i think of all the education that i missed
but then my homework was never quite like this
ow got it bad got it bad got it bad"
did they draw a wiener on the right side of the front at the top by the necklace

i would take take my time and draw in it while your wearing it your so hot
one of them draw kyle from south park in the middle
you should either do this with every class so you eventually have a closet full of dresses with kids drawings all over them or keep bringing out the same dress and let kids keep adding to it every year
in before you can get a dress that is this from target
where can i go to school with teachers with cool tattoos
that s a very nice dress are you planning on having a new edition each year and keep all the old ones somewhere safe seems like a pretty neat keepsake to pull out and review in years i wonder how many memories it would bring back too
i tried this once in high school i got back a bunch of dicks drawings
i can t help but think everyone only does things in real life so they can post it on the internet
this is absolutely wonderful and charming what a great idea if you do it again you should film your students it would be a fun process to watch
beautiful dress on a beautiful woman i love it hope you all have a wonderful summer
that s cool but if i saw you in person i d definitely hear mr f in the background
where did you find the base dress i love this style and idea
this is the rd post i ve seen of gals getting their students to draw on a white dress wow it s a crazy coincidence
the ninja turtle looking guy in the ear flap hat is adorable
question the images are permanently imbued into the fabric if so please share how
username checks out cool dress i don t know what it takes to keep the drawings from fading but hope it lasts
and when i brag about how children made my clothing they say i m cruel
that‚Äôs a dreadfully sexy art teacher i would hang out with
holy shit you really do look like a goth taylor swift
the post right above this on the front page is some chick who is wearing her students drawling on a dress for the last day of school i did a double take to make sure it wasn‚Äôt the same woman
you look like a cross between taylor swift and mae whitman üòä
you have the face of a young kirsten dunst and is that an archer on your shoulder excellent
i m starting to see enough of these that i almost wonder if it should be it s own sub i would definitely subscribe haha they always look so adorable
you re going to kill it at the pta meetings melting dad s and kid s hearts alike
some kid wrote i love you must be a good teacher also is that a x files tattoo on her arm
this must be the before pic they‚Äôre all terrible drawings
you do look like a doll in this pretty dress your students have talents for sure
i would have probably drawn bewbs on the bewbs part of that dress as a kid and as an adult
amazing idea keep those treasures i still have a bunch of my students art and love it everyday
this must be the new basic white bitch thing everyone is doing it now
lumberjack earned his her place at the center that kid has natural talent
upvote definitely for art not for a hot girl for art damnit
that is super rad hope you rick that for years to come
wow you bear a striking resemblance to a family member of mine you re not from michigan are you
so you used your students so you can post a picture of yourself on reddit lol wow
one question how do you treat this so that when you wash it the art doesn‚Äôt come off
is it just me or does she vaguely resemble taylor swift ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è idek lol
my mom let her students draw on quilt squares with crayons but it turned out looking like a mess of colors
i thought that was a cutty bage tat and i had to creep on your profile to confirm love her so much and this dress
thats really cool how do you wash it without losing the drawings
you are the kind of teacher that kids remember even when they are my age amp x b amp x b to this day i remember and am grateful for mrs bergoc my english teacher in primary school
what is this hot teacher day on reddit or something all my school teachers were gross creepy dudes i wish i had taylor swift stunt doubles
i think you and about other teachers read the same pinterest post
blatantly stole this idea from another teacher who posted this years ago
make another one at the end of the year so you can see there progress or have them start drawing from left to right as you would read so the progress is really noticeable that would be so cool
i just found out this is a thing just want to say you should probably look out for the kind of student i was
the amount of people calling this person an attention seeker really depresses me
you know i m looking at your username and i can see it
kudos for rocking it even with the tiny penis there
the drawings from your students are lovely which university do you teach at
did you make that dress if so what s the pattern i ve been looking for it
i saw the other one first but i upvoted both because art üòç
i wish my elementary school teachers had tattoos and piercings
looks like a tmnt kyle brovloski under her boobs there
did they do this while you were wearing the dress very cool
now that s kick ass my favorite teachers i scho were are teachers i am not even in the art world but i always appreciated them
the kid who drew the picture in the middle is definitely a go getter üòÜ
was that tattoo on your arm done by cutty in boone nc o
posts of random teachers wearing the same exact outfit on the front page reddit is so basic lmao
if i did that i guarantee you at least one of my students would‚Äôve drawn a penis
it s adorable until you realize she teaches high school art
this it s probably wildly inappropriate but i m hot for teacher
where were all of these hot teachers when i was in grade school
sorry to be so crass but suddenly van halen s hot for teacher is rocking out in full swing in my head
it‚Äôs like the third time i‚Äôve seen this idea it‚Äôs not genuine anymore
op s username checks out i thought you were ts all tatted up at first
did you just take that idea from the other teacher who posted like hours ago
hot young girl pic to the front page with you and rip your inbox while your at it
where did you get the dress from i love this idea and would love to do it with my year s
make sure there‚Äôs not a penis on it kids are assholes
i didn t know they let yr olds teach classes also i didn t know yr olds could be so h oh shit chris hansen
angela jolie might have been the og her kids drew all over the back of her wedding dress in
congrats i m in college studying to become an art teacher too i can t wait
you know what your downvotes be damned i‚Äôve been drinking and i would have put a dick on her butt
no need to worry about getting a stain it will just for with the theme
wow has anyone ever told you you look amazingly like a goth version of taylor swift amp x b also the dress is adorable
not to take away from the awesome dress idea but that fox mulder tattoo is fucking sick
i feel like at a certain grade level this is no longer a viable assignment thanks for the dress with the giant penis on the crotch and seventeen swastikas
i ve learned something new today taylor swift was at one point an art teacher
i feel so much love right now i‚Äôm just gonna stay here for a while and read comments
holy crap gothtaylorswift really is the perfect way to describe you
amazing dress i‚Äôm sorry but you kinda look like elizabeth from bioshok infinite thats amazing actually
such an adorable also one of the most apt usernames i ve ever seen on reddit
i can t begin to describe how much i love this practice props teach youre awesome
if you tried doing this in middle school i d almost guarantee someone would sneak a penis drawing on there
tattoos are the trash of modern day society and to think people like this teach our children
i wish i had teachers this cool almost all mine were ancient and had checked out long ago only a few were good
lmao thought the thumbnail looked a lot like taylor swift then saw your username
i love this that dress looks great on you did your kids enjoy it as much as mine did
i fucking love your mulder tattoo dress is cute too but that mulder is ace
can i just say i think you are the prettiest teacher ever
i see this beautiful lady on the news a couple years from now
where dis you get the dress i really like the cut of it
u made your kids make you a keepsake lmao i would ve been the kid to say fuck that we re supposed to be learning smh lol did they ask if they could give you something
this is the teacher that i would have had a crush on lord almighty she is pretty
doesn t art world etiquette dictate that you give credit to the girl that you got this idea from be not the biter for to claim what is not thine own is to become the antithesis of all that is dope and nifty f scott fitzgerald
sorry that this is unrelated but how do you do eyeliner so nice
as someone aspiring to become an art teacher what kind of degree did you pursue and what advice do you have for someone looking to pursue a teaching career in art
i d be in the art room for the whole parent teacher conference
maybe it‚Äôs my conservative suburban chicago upbringing in the s but i think it‚Äôs cool there are tatted up elementary teachers nowadays you look like a peach soft and sweet but with a hard core
i was about to tell you who you look like but then i saw your username you already know
that is the coolest thing i ve seen since leslie knope s wedding dress üòç
one of your students was rebellious and went for your arm seriously though looks great
when did trolls stop becoming teachers my teachers were never this attractive not even close
how many times is this going to happen and then get posted as if it‚Äôs been done for the first time
there s nothing cute about this picture and we shouldn t need an explanation in the title to make a picture cute or not also humans aren t cute so i will always downvote a post here with only humans in it
tfw my first grade teacher was as wholesome and as pretty tattoos and all and at religious school no less
i love this it looks great on you too bonus points for the x files tattoo lol üëåüèª
thought she looks young for a teach‚Äî oh yea i‚Äôm old now
a relative of mine used to work as a higher up in production for the x files i ve actually met mulder and skully and had a few characters episodes names after me
did you take it off in front of the class wow i want to be in your art class
when i was a kid my teachers wouldn‚Äôt be caught dead with a visible tattoo i mean they probably wouldn‚Äôt even get hired if they had any kind of visible body modification pretty cool that it‚Äôs not really a big deal now
looks really awesome reminds me of the table i have last year of highschool i had everyone sign a small table i brought in on the last few days covered it with a gloss and it s a yearbook with a practical purpose
how are you only teaching art to prek kids i thought kindergarten teachers just taught everything
i don t you didnt mean to but you literally ran a sweatshop full of kids making you a dress
my bus driver did something like this with a plain white tshirt i dont have any pictures though
teaches elementary kids and has an nsfw profile lol
this probably makes me a horrible person but i spent an inordinate amount of time noticing which drawings probably first started out as a penis
not trying to be a creeper here but how old are you my fiance is thinking about getting into being an art teacher but shes worried about how long it will take that s an adorable keepsake and fantastic idea
are you able to wash the dress without losing the art
anyone else feel like a creeper zooming in on the picture to see the drawings
you seem like the kind of teacher who doesn‚Äôt get discount pricing my uncle can relate
now im trying to remeber if any of my teachers would have been hot back in the day nope l i got nothing
i would have the hots for you so bad if you were my art teacher back in school
this is an awesome idea what grade level do you teach elementary i am finishing my first year as an art teacher too but i teach middle school art i feel like if i had them do this it would be covered with penises memes and words like yeet and bet üòÇ
i see they re not old enough to want to draw dicks all over it yet or they re hidden in the pictures
you know how they say some people are just better cut out to be teachers than everyone else ladies and gentlemen i give you gothtaylorswift
sick mulder tat also all around adorable love the dress idea
you look like all the art teachers i ve ever had is there like a secret conference of art teachers
this is not aww as i know it to know that you re normalizing crazy hair and tattoos to young children makes me sad
too bad you can t take the kids drawing on your arm off
i think you need to teach harder it looks like a bunch of school children did this
idk who let you teach children with that weird ass tattoo on your arm
based on those drawings you must be a shit ass art teacher lol jk i couldn t help myself
saw other reddit post and was jealous of mad street cred of some other not even art teacher during lunch break went to store to pickup plain white dress and have kids do the same thing street cred earned dignity crushed
holy i m in love with your aesthetic also that username is spot on
is this the outfit you wear for the first song when you come out on stage
didn t someone else just do this a few weeks ago it s an awesome idea hopefully you weren t wearing it when they colored it lol
clicked her user name and was kicked back because user was nsfw this is an elementary teacher i can get behind
dude is that a cutty bage piece on your arm i know that style anywhere looks amazing
how weird i recognised you straight away from that pic of you and your grandma when she was younger
itt teacher tricks students into making her custom print fabric
i wanted to do something similar with my students but as a tattoo i would be able to have a little piece of them forever haha
you look like kirsten dunst mixed with taylor swift
i used to do this kind of thing to my own clothes as a middle schooler me and all of my friends would draw on everyone s t shirts together and then each of us had a shirt with drawings and words from our bff s
lol okayyy this is the third post of this on reddit i‚Äôve seen
apparently someone struggle switch coloring inside the lines they drew on your arm
you do look like taylor swift first thing i thought when i saw you guess you‚Äôre probably tired of hearing that
thats so cute i love littlenkid drawings they are the cutest thing what a treasure
shopped head and something is wrong with that arm on the left picture
real question how many times did you get poked by little kids trying to find their drawing
aka i can t wait to show off all my tattoos ive gotten in the last months
definitely the hottest babe on the internet right now
there was a couple of other teachers that did this it s a fantastic idea and i wish my teachers were this awesome
every year there seems to be some viral teaching trend that makes it on here
you are now ms frizzle well that what the dress reminds me of
ahhhh the cool art teacher that i never had the luck to meet
this didn t make me go aww so downvoted not going to lie though she s pretty cute but doesn t fit the mold of what this sub is about
you look fun and creative i bet you‚Äôre an awesome teacher‚ù§Ô∏è
i ve seen so many teachers doing this all of the sudden the new wholesome wave
that is awesome as hell and kudos to you for loving those kids so much i can only wish my daughter will have a teacher as passionate as you are
i love that at least two kiddos put ‚Äúi love you‚Äù and ‚Äúi love ms yoot ‚Äù
i just refuse to believe you are a real person you look like every drawing of an art teacher from the books i read as a kid
where the fuck were all these hot teachers when i was in school
i totally thought you were taylor swift in the thumbnail and then i saw your username well done
what s up with all these adorable teachers and their dresses
can i go back to whatever grade that you teach please
if teachers were half this attractive in my day i may have never touched marijuana my entire life
anyone else get an eerie photoshop vibe from this picture
i m a high school art teacher this does not sit well with me this act feels self serving you not your students are receiving the credit for the work they have done your intentions may have been to highlight their work but you are the one getting the attention for it kids are incredibly perceptive as an elementary teacher i know you re aware of this they will see the attention you receive for this project they may come away from this feeling slighted pushed out of the spotlight for work they have done i ve fallen into the same pit myself subconsciously seeking glory for the work my students have done under my encouragement they will pick up on it i just want to encourage you to find ways of showcasing your kids work that doesn t involve yourself in the process let them be the stars step back and take yourself out of the equation completely like i said i ve been in this space too i want to tell you that it feels so much more gratifying allowing your kiddos to reap all the glory
i like how neither picture actually shows the entire dress
that is awesome i tutored at a junior high school and this is my first year and on the last day i will have my students sign my school shirt not as cool as this but just having something like this to be reminded of them is something special to have
does anyone know where to get a dress that looks like this i‚Äôm thinking it might make a great low key wedding dress
ya see as a middle school teacher this is something i could never attempt the horror
i feel like this could be fake because there was a hell of a lot of work put into taking this picture
you look exactly like early s kirsten dunst threw me through a loop very cute idea for a dress is it something you re going to do now every year
ah a cuttybage tattoo you are so lucky she is my favorite
apparently all you have to do to get karma is get kids to draw all over a white dress brb
what‚Äôs your hair texture and or routine i‚Äôve always wanted to pull off bangs like that but i can‚Äôt figure out how to make it work i can‚Äôt wait to have my daughter do this for me in a few years thanks for the idea
don t think your a good art teacher all those drawings are terrible
i love that this has become a thing now have we seen an male teachers do this with a tie shirt or something like that
best piece of art to be displayed on my bedroom floor
lol you aren t even showing any of their drawings in the second picture
do you teach adults i m gonna be taking lessons in a couple mo ths possibly
is there a fox mulder in your arm do you still believe
so beautiful would you like to sell it i really like your dress
as an elementary teacher you re allowed to have visible tattoos i always assumed it was like the military where they had to be covered or maybe i m wrong about the military thing too very real possibility that i just don t know anything
this is the th post of the same idea i ve seen just today go away
i would draw all over you with my co crayons yeah my crayola crayons
were you married but are now single but have a cool three legged dog
didn t i see this yesterday with a different person
my art teacher was old as dirt and acted like she was tripping on mushrooms all the time your cute as fuck lucky ass kids
op has anyone ever told you that you look like kirsten dunst
i was gonna ask if anyone ever told you you look like taylor swift but then i saw your username üòå
what type of markers did you use and will it stay after being washed
you are a beautiful young lady you need cool things
oh one of the little ones wrote i love you my heart
is that a penis by the green swastika looking thing to the bottom left
damn this is like the th dress i‚Äôve seen in days ride that wave i guess
that s so adorable you should do this for every year
i was thinking taylor swift then i look at the username
lol i d definitely have issues focussing in your class
is this the same chick we keep seeing with the dress drawings
there seems to be a person lying in a grave i think the kid tries to tell you something also i am into necrophilia so can you tell the kid to make a photo and send it to me
you should commission someone to embroider it to keep the art forever or do it yourself
i straight up thought you were my friends wife she did the same and you both look identical
it s an exceptional dress and you re stunning once you wear it
i‚Äôm sorry to say but you need a new job those students of yours draw like fucking shit
i identify with the kid who drew the sad looking lonely red guy making his way towards a flower on a spiritual level
goddamn my art teachers in school didn t look like this
sorry if this is too personal and please feel free to not respond does the school you work for allow the tattoos and piercing s to be on show if so was it difficult to find a school which would accommodate this i only ask because i have a friend who s an art teacher and she sometimes struggled to get a school who would allow her to keep her pink dyed hair which i think is a ridiculous policy
i don t know that i ve ever seen such an appropriate user name
if memory serves me right teachers didn t look like her when i was in school
i plan on doing this when i become an art teacher hopefully i remember
i love this so much such a great way to encourage their individual creativities
oh damn that s genius it s like the last day before you leave school and everyone s signing each other s shirts but more permanent brilliant
we did this at an english summer camp program i did here in japan each ‚Äúteam leader‚Äù would have a bandana and all of their kids would write something on it pretty cute but a shirt or dress woulda been better for sure
bonus when you wear the same dress on the class graduation
i see someone went for the extra credit and drew on your arm
when i was in elementary school every teacher i had was a year old lady kids today have young pretty hip teachers my music teacher had a wooden leg these kids have a art teacher that wears a cool dress they got to design i feel like if i was a student today chances are a lot lower i would ve grown to hate the classroom
i m starting to think this is a robe design and it s becoming viral
think i m in love with you for that fox mulder tattoo
here come the thirsty desperate assholes to get the thread locked
wait didn t the mrs frizzle lady yesterday have this identical dress
honest question here were you wearing the dress as they drew on it maybe that s a stupid question because well you know inappropriateness
k upvotes that s probably the best kid drawn dress reddit has ever seen
username checks out for the face she is exactly taylor swift tattoo checks out for the dress matching slayin it
cashier two watermelons hosting a cookout this person nope making puppy swings
"‚Äúso tom what did you do this weekend ‚Äù
‚Äúoh just this and that nothing interesting definitely didn‚Äôt spend hours cutting watermelons into dog swings and filming it ‚Äù"
when you are asked to hang up the wet clothes to dry but instead do this
i think a famous th century british poet put it best amp x b wake me up before you go go don t leave me hanging on like a yo yo
one seems to be really enjoying swinging and the other one not so much üéºjust a swinging üéº
i thought they were having a swing but they got a watermelon instead
omg they are so freaking cute and the way they are so chubby their fluffy fur coming out the watermelon swings it s a perfect gif
this was engineered perfect for these here interwebs
dog karen just because kevin likes it doesn t mean we all like it
just keep swinging swinging swinging just keep swinging
looks the guy on the right has had enough and is about to throw up
coupled pendulums are quite fascinating notice how one starts with a large amplitude and then the amplitude transfers to the second dog laden watermelon if the gif didn t cut out this cycle would continue back and forth between the two puppets
there is always that one kid that enjoys everything way to much
yeah the puppers are cute but all i can think when watching this is why what kind of crackhead decided to carve out a watermelon and the shove an animal inside it and swing it
now they‚Äôre going to have sticky butts from from setting in melons lol
hmmm two slightly burnt marshmallows swinging in watermelons i like it üëç
it‚Äôs five am and i should be sleeping but i can‚Äôt thank you for the melon boyes
haha same face i make oddly enough as much as i don t like it i always take sips from my so
typical grand dad move before giving kids back to parents
ahh the beginning of a lifelong struggle with obesity begins
remarkably similar to my reaction when i tried coke for the first time
this is not cute it is distressing op you should really rethink some of your values if this is cute to you
surprised the finches stayed still for that long mine are always bouncing around at full speed except at night

so sorry for your loss it‚Äôs never easy how old was he
i feel your pain genuinely we walked our yo girl across the rainbow üåà bridge last friday it‚Äôs as if there‚Äôs this huge hole left in your heavy heart that seems impossible to fill you were the best thing ever to him as he was to you huge hugs
freddy looks like he was a grand old pup sorry for your loss and take care
so sorry for your loss freddy looks like he was a great little guy lt such a sweet face my lukie has been waiting for me on the other side of the bridge i know he will show your freddy all the best places to nap in the sun while they wait a huge hug to you and kisses to heaven
doubt drake is the real name considering you‚Äôre not op and this has been reposted a ton
omg my cat does this shit too his favourite thing is climbing up on the shelf to lick a big terracotta mirror we have hanging on the wall
oh my gosh my alli does this too except she licks the blinds even if they are dirty
im a bit concerned if the cat does that a lot doesnt it mean they have some sort of vitamin deficiency im just wondering
the reset button is the nose boop the snoot for seconds and your cat will revert back to factory settings
the cat is highly stressed not funny at all try to find out what s wrong and help them
my cat sort of does this she sleeps next to me in bed at night and sometimes licks the bedsheets just for the hell of it
i think your cat is sick and lack of iron probly thats why he she licks wall try to go vet
the other cat lookin back at you like you seein this shit lol üòÇ
excuse me are you a disney princess attracting wild animals like that
awww it s adorable better go back to where mommy told it to stay
this little baby looks like it hasn t gotten it s sea legs yet must be pretty brand new
why does it look like a pedo creeping up on some kids
why does it look as if it is about to say yeth master here is the brain
did you touch it i hope you didnt touch it because if you touched it its mommaiodjnlaw fnqerfnaepfnpearnfqepaignprg
all tuckered out from being the keeper of knowledge
do owls make good pets i was around some close up recently and they were much more docile and cute than expected
he is so comfy cozy he refuses to open his eyes nope not looking busy snuggling
wait are you selling a chest sheet for the o w l s if so i very much would like to buy some owls
this takes flashing your hooters to a whole new level
kid mr owl how many licks does it take to get the center of a tootsie pop owl let‚Äôs find out crunch kid depression
that owl has no interest in moving from its position
so cool how much time does it take to train a bird of pray talons of time
i never knew i needed a cat named carrot time to add to the kitty crew
omg my cats name is carrot boiii i love him so much he is still very young though
he s bigger than you goodness he has a beautiful face
both of you are adorable this is such a happy picture
that s a bear man huggable bear shoulda named him teddy
phil what a strange name why not go with something more conventional like fluffo mcchonkybutt or lieutenant bearface
there is a third type that acts like you are trying to force them into a tub of acid
just glad he aint drinking his own bathwater that always grosses me out
the one who makes the jacuzzi and the one who gets to enjoy the jacuzzi
i love that dog just sitting there with that look of what is that dog doing why can‚Äôt he just sit here and enough being ü§£üê∂
wheres the dog screaming bloody murder over touching water
the lady at the end knew it was something scary but still couldn t prepare herself
my dog just stays still frozen on the spot like i m abusing her then slowly starts to move towards the edge of the bath to escape there s kinds of dogs
one is trying to dig out water while other is just sitting there smiling needs a hour version
the golden will not rest until he‚Äôs thoroughly excavated all that water
man how big is that tub to fit a lab and sibe potential malamute and just sitting there too the goodiest boy girl
am i the only person who saw this as two miniature dogs in a solo cup
‚Äúhey i‚Äôm trying to have a good time ‚Äú ‚Äúbuttomg g g g i gotta dig tooooo yhe botoommmm‚Äù
i don‚Äôt know what to do with this i‚Äôm both in awe and completely horrified
holy shit fucking kill it jesus christ wash out your ears and visit the doctor just to make sure that fucker didn t lay eggs in there
get the fuck out if its property and leave the poor thing alone
this is about as cute as letting a dog eat out of your mouth
it looks like it‚Äôs trying to invite you into its home to give you a tour i love it
what the hell is it and more importantly why is no one grabbing it
put oil in your ear to drown anything still in there
why is someone taking video of that shit like homie has a fucking pet monkey instead of a god damn spider in his ear what in the fucking hell
my immediate reaction was to see if i can buy a mini ear vacuum
cute little brain spider you can hear their whispers in a completely silent room
i m so sorry for your loss putting down a fur baby is never an easy choice to make
i‚Äôm so sorry for your loss sending you and your fluffy all the love
so sorry for the loss of your furry best friend my heart hurts for you
you have brought each other so much happiness he is a special kitty and a very handsome one at that peace to you in your loss
"i do want to say thank you to the msu vet
clinin for both being available and the level of compassion and care they showed for him"
from his point of view you gave him a lifetime of love and kindness you were there at the end and provided the last kindness you could losing lubed ones always sucks but eventually it will suck less but the louvre will still be there
my condolences we lost our family cat recently to the same thing one of the hardest moments of my life
we lost our good girl serenity months ago after years im sorry for your loss
as one who stayed with his life long friend of years till the end holding his paw until the last breath and barely holding it together until i walked out the door just remember him as he was before and keep pictures close it sucks but it s okay to be upset i kept in mind he always sat next to me if i was upset or something was on my mind figured he wouldn t want me upset about his passing helped a bit anyway sorry it sucks
some background to chloe i live on a property with hedges on both sides that on the other side lead directly to my neighbors we managed to clear a little hole in one of hedges that‚Äôs big enough for the neighbors dog to come over and chill play with my dog or get food cuz we spoil the fuck out of dogs here one day our new neighbors to the other side of the hedge with a hole moved in and soon enough we had a new face in our back yard i tried to pet her and she would run away every time i was so sad but soon enough understood that she was afraid soon enough we realized that its all men she was afraid of and when we asked our neighbor they said that she was abused by her previous owner and grew a fear of all men for two years i have been doing anything i can to get close to her today it finally happened
sad that humans instill fear into animals to the point they‚Äôre afraid of certain people glad she‚Äôs coming around
the only way i‚Äôd be happier with this post is if it included you punching her previous owner or whoever the male is in the face
my current dog used to be the same way and wouldn‚Äôt even let me give him treats it took about years after i got him from the shelter to pet him let alone give him treats now he‚Äôs my bundle of joy and he enjoys me picking him up after i come home
thankfully there are cool people out there like you to help level out the assholes in the world nice doggie very cool
yay how awesome i hope you can pet her more often now
i‚Äôm so happy for both of you you made my day i‚Äôm really glad that there are actually really good people in this world ‚ù§Ô∏è
and she walks over to you with such confidence i m proud of her good job showing her that she can trust you
all the pets and treats super happy for the both of you
awww i‚Äôm glad you didn‚Äôt give up and she finally let you get those pets in
you can see on the dog s face that she realizes she s been missing out on lots of high quality butt scratches
how do you think she can tell a person s gender is it voice related
my aunt s dog is the same way the only man she trusts without my aunt standing next to her is my uncle
op you harvest the most truthful smile after one year of hard work you deserve it Ôºâ
not only are people watching this happy but by looking at chloe‚Äôs tail you can also see she is happy too
i don‚Äôt think dogs can differentiate between men and women right i mean i don‚Äôt know but i don‚Äôt think so
even more impressive is that she let you pass out of her field of vision as she walked by
my parents had rescued an initially skittish terrier mix and all seemed okay until dad pulled out a fly swatter the little guy ran under the table shaking and refusing to come out we never knew what his past life was but it clearly wasn‚Äôt good
thank you i needed that today give my love to chloe
i m guessing you got a couple of bonus points for letting her go swimming
congratulations that kind of thing can make grown ups cry
she looks like the happiest pupper there so happy for her
my roommate s dog doesn t like men either she says he s been like that since she adopted him i m one of the only guys he likes and will run to when he get s scared nervous my mom s dog always hated hats for some reason
happy doggo she deserves all the happiness in the world
wish i could accomplish this with my gf s cat problem is i m super allergic he s afraid of men
way to put in that time and patience much respect sucks she had to go through that but its great to see she is surrounded by kindness now
so sweet is not strange that dogs never mistrust women only men i had a dog he s still alive but my ex took him that i never worried about when greeting women but was always careful because he disliked some men on sight he was also racist because he really didn t like black men it must be a pheromone thing i would love to hear some theories on that
it truly is sad when a pet gets traumatized because of braindead people but it s not always the case i ve had a calico cat that really didn t like women at all would hiss at them and flee if they ever got close to her and we had her since she was months old also my dog when i was a kid was racist he would bark like crazy at my friend if he came over or a neighbor further down the street at least my friend found that really funny for some reason the neighbor not so much though
this is a true success story for you both congratulations
i dive head first into some heavy shit on the internet and always come back to this sub to feel warm inside this is the cutest fucking shit have an upvote sir
when i was a kid we had a spaniel named jess my gamma had stolen her from her neighbor who had mistreated her she was regularly beaten and starved jess would constantly growl and try to bite the postman may dad and any other males who came to our house but after a few years she grew more comfortable around them and learnd to love them let them love her
had a friend with a dog that was super scared of men one day he was fine around us even kissed my hand a few times next time i was over he was back to being scared again
my brother has a female pitbull who gets very timid around males but loves my brother and all females after many walks with her and slowly getting her to like me i moved to a different state when i go and visit it s always the same shes scared of me at first then finally wants me to pet her it s always my goal to for me to have her come to me before i go back home
yeah i have a hard time believing this knowing you recorded it
ah yes butt scratches nothing says i m one of the good ones like some welcome butt scratches
my roommate got a dog that s afraid of men it s hard to be patient when you live with it wish i could make it happen faster
d aw that s adorable i m happy that your relationship with her has helped her be more trusting
glad she has come such a long way to trusting you op hopefully such a beautiful old dog can be happier with the raiming time she has
my dog had the same problem with men she wouldn t let me pet her and would stay in the corner most of the day now i m her human and shes absolutely obsessed with me i love you april
look at that happy smile so glad you were able to gain her trust give her plenty of butt scratches
ahh she s such a happy girl when you re petting her it will take some time i m sure for her to become totally comfortable with you but this post really made me happy to see her enjoying your affection
step cut a hole in the box step that s your unconditional and nonsexual love on a box
wow you have no idea how great this is to see three months ago we adopted a year old dog who is also fearful of men she has a rough background she was rescued at ten months old from a dog hoarding situation where she had never lived inside the house unfortunately her placement ended up being a home where the husband didn t like her and was verbally loud and rough with her so she spent the next year walking on eggshells besides being fearful of my husband she is also overall a frightened dog she s afraid of the wind the ceiling fan one particular fence on our walk etc we ve had her since mid february and she is doing really well in so many ways she s completely obsessed with me and never further than about feet away i ve been able to teach her sit stay down touch to hit the bells etc fortunately i m retired so that works out pretty well as the trainer predicted giving her tricks gives her something to offer and seems to build up her sense of herself it s just so great to see my husband thankfully is a hugely patient man he s been hand feeding her with treats multiple times each day since we got her now she s gotten to the point where she will take treats from his hand and occasionally she ll warily let him pet the top of her head a bit but nothing like your video but i know we ll get there
i remember when my pup finally came up to me it had been months and she never came near me until one day i went to the vet with her and my gf my gf had to take a call in the hallway and my pup went behind my legs under the chair and since that day she leaps into my arms all lbs of her now when i get home i also lost space on the bed as she sleeps nuzzled up to me and keeps contact all night long no matter where i move we don t deserve dogs
that is super sweet that you have been patient with her
bitches hold grudges yo female dogs instinctively dislike me making me think that female dogs might be smarter on average
this sweet girl looks literally just like my good boy we‚Äôve never known what kind of dog he is we were told a border collie mix but we aren‚Äôt sure what kind of dog is this our boy is straight up the best dog ever he‚Äôs our favorite dog in the whole world i‚Äôd love to know what breed he is
how did you do it my neighbors dog is the same way she won t let any male human pet her and i ve been trying for months
you could have scared her as a joke but she probably wouldn t get it
i m about to get my first ever foster dog tomorrow it doesn t seem like she has any major fears based on what the rescue has seen but i just can t wait for that moment where it feels like she relaxes with me and feels safe and happy way to go op it might feel like a win for you but it s huge for her and you re awesome for being so patient and gentle for her so she can grow
i cannot imagine how good it must feel after waiting so long good on ya
you‚Äôre a good human you‚Äôve secured your place in the great dog park in the sky üíõ
this is sadly quite common at the pound we get dogs who are scared of men scared of dark skinned men scared of men with hats etc with lots of patience and love many of them will eventually come around
my dog misty is a sweet girl but i believe her previous owners treated her pretty badly because she won t let anybody she doesn t know well pet her or even get close her previous owners were jehovah s witnesses and when we are on our daily walk she simply ignores other people unless they get too close but when she sees some jws walking on the sidewalk or even people dressed up like jws tend to do she barks and growls and get s agitated just a guy in a suit or a woman in a sunday church dress is enough to set her off dog s have long memories when they are mistreated
me you have to pet that dog op op for how long me yes
this causes so many emotions in me i‚Äôm pissed someone could incite this kind of response in a dog but love you‚Äôve been able to show them not all humans are assholes and that pupper seems happy now
people surprised a dog can tell genders dogs can smell drugs on you when they are covered and hidden y all don t think a dog can tell the difference between sweaty grapes and meat pockets
my sister in laws dog wad the same now she loves me more than anyone else
i m sorry but i m going to be skeptical of this this is the first time you say the dog is comfortable of letting you touch her the way she seeks your hand especially a reaching open hand toward her face turns away from you while being in a vulnerable state and wags her tail this is hard to believe it is the first time she is demonstrating this perhaps the story is true but i highly doubt this is the first time she is demonstrating this level of comfort and trust around you all the signals she is conveying point to her already established trust of you sweet nonetheless but hard to believe this is a first time account of this happening
bullshit no way that was the first time she would have been more tentative and not looking back smiling almost like it was nothing new if it was the first time also u wouldn t be rubbing her roughly like that the first time knowing she s scared of men and u have never stoked her before
i have a cat who hates men which blows because i‚Äôm a guy because my family and i think he got kicked around at my aunts apartment complex when he was a kitten yang the cat lets me pick him up now and pet him but for about years he would hiss at me and swat at me i understanding the feeling and i hope you feel joyous knowing you helped an animal trust men just a little bit more
damn man what do i have to do to get a house like that and a pool and on top a living and trusting pup
my friend has a dog that hates men in cowboy hats due to his previous ownership goes crazy and attacks when he sees them
my dad has a male german shepard that he purchased off of craigslist not the best place to buy animals that absolutley hated men my dad included after working with him for over a year he finally gets happy when he sees me and wants to play he still a little leary of my dad but my dad looks like the previous owner he did stop his aggressive behavior with everyone and i am able to let my children pet him as well with supervision it s been a long road but he is a good dog and is incredibly smart in fact i loved him so much i bought a gsd of my own and they are the best of buds
she s not just letting you pet her she s enjoying the hell out of it your patience with this pooch is so worth it we need more pet owners people like you
my parents have a dog that looks almost exactly like her named chance they adopted him because at the kennel they thought he looked old and defeated and wanted to give him a relaxing loving home to fill his remaining days they took him to the vet and turns out he s only like years old just looks older with his markings lol mom and dad got a kick out of that knowing he ll be around a lot longer than initially anticipated
fuck the doubters i used to dogsit for a good girl like this it took me a long time to get her to trust me but once she did every minute i was there she refused to leave my side it felt really good the first time she actively came to me by herself
apparently everyone s dog is afraid of men yet dogs are man s best friend
she s a sweet little lady i love her and i love you for giving her the patience and support she deserves lt
not only did she let you pet her she looks so happy to be pet by you and to be around you
happy doggo just curious any explanation on how why dog s can tell gender is it a voice thing i mean i can t tell the gender of a dog unless i sneak a peak down under heck some people are pretty ambiguous too happy trails
omg my cousin s cat hates women by feeding him everyday i managed to get him to eat out of my hand still doesn t trust me fully tho
why are they filming anyone else feel like of what s on reddit is a lie
i adopted a dog that was scared of tall me sad took the dog a couple of years to get over it
i believe it this has happened to me what a sweet old girl congrats ü•∞ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥
my girlfriend‚Äôs sister‚Äôs dog was exactly the same way and it took about a year for him to get accompanied to me and he‚Äôs so flippin‚Äô cute love that good boi
my current roommates dog named scout was like this he was a rescue they were told he basically lived outside the first years of his life he was afraid of everyone but men morseo than women my saddest memory of this time is i was cleaning up after a party at my apartment he had relaxed enough to be wandering around normally and had even let me pet him a few minutes earlier which was a big deal at the time when i started cleaning up though i rolled up a placemat without thinking of it as soon as he saw the rolled up tube he went from content to terrified and backed away into a corner where he sat cowering until they took him back to their apartment he refused to let me pet him again that night it s been years since then and how owners and i have moved in together and now scout sits inches away from me while i eat hopeful for food and paws at me for pets
so nice did you try chicken jerky my boyfriend s dog loves chicken jerky and runs over to me when i even touch the cupboard where we keep the chicken jerky maybe chloe will associate you with something wonderful like a treat
i used to have a god named chloe she looked just like your pup
awww man that s adorable my parents have adopted a couple of rescues that were terrified of men initially but eventually both warmed up to me and i became their favorite person lol it s such a damn good feeling
maybe you should pet alyssa milano you could be the liberal whisperer
nothing more satisfying than winning over a fearful animals trust never met a cat that i couldn‚Äôt win over yet haha
that‚Äôs the face of someone who realizes they‚Äôve been missing out
i haven‚Äôt had a single female let get close to them in years
this so heartwarming similar deal for myself and a friend s corgi named doris very fearful of close contact would nip at me if my face got too close after a year she now gives me mouth kisses which is typically a no go for me but wow what progress
plot twist op s doctor diagnoses him with low testosterone next week
spoilers it is just their normal dog they pet every day
there aren t enough men like you for the women who need you
friends of mine in wyoming had a senior rescue dog with similar issues bad previous home life trust issues etc wouldn t come within feet without giving me the side eye until one day i was eating a sandwich on the couch he moved in slowly a few inches at a time until i scritched his chest gently and gave him a bite of turkey after that he would walk right up as long as i was sitting to get a scritch before heading to his bed to nap
i wish there was a subreddit for scared animals that realize what affection is and then give in
poor pupper nobody ever taught her gender is just a social construct
i m so glad you saved her from the previous owner she clearly loves you back
good job shame she had such a bad experiences in her past but learning to trust you she‚Äôs one step closer to being able to give love and take love without fear she looks quite old from the grey white snout it‚Äôs about time she have nothing but good times and best friends
i once had a feral cat finally let me pet it after that he was jello and just wanted me to hold him over my shoulder never showed any fear to me again then the other tomcat beat him up i never saw him again
mine is a male rescued cat he was also traumatised by the human males he encountered in previous ownerships until now he is still afraid hearing human male voice and always hide if they visit my house so i understand the feelings of being someone who shed light on a traumatised pet
how do they recognize male vs female of a different species dogs are so smort
so you happened to have filmed on the right day or you filmed everyday hoping for the best
this is literally just a video of someone petting a dog
i m glad you kept trying you should be proud poor thing glad she s coming around
as someone with a rescue dog who is terrified of people i know the feeling when they finally let you pet them or get close its taken a year and its hard to see the progress until someone new comes over and he goes back to them how he was with me when i first got him its a big reward when they are comfortable with you
find me a dog that doesn‚Äôt love a good butt scratch
i m so happy she s learning to get over her fear good job chloe
gotta love when sjws battlecry on reddit modern feminism is cancer
sorry for stupid question how does a dog know between men and women
aww it‚Äôs like she had wanted to do it and then finally did it and was immediately glad she did like when you kiss a new person and it‚Äôs really nice
it breaks my heart that people can have such an intentional negative impact on animals but it restores it to know that we can regain their trust thanks for the moment
you re lucky my pit bull samber hates men she wouldn t even go near my dad who in his life would not hurt her i had to switch her to an all female vet practice because her hatred of men is that strong the last time that she had to go to the emergency vet it took vet techs me and a strong muzzle just so that the vet could check her out
my brothers dog is an adopted great dane and she‚Äôs the same way she runs from all men who get close to her and after many months she came over for a very very quick petting and took off haha i‚Äôll take it
aren‚Äôt you petting her too close to her bum given the fear of males especially or is that just a human thing sorry if a dumb question i love dogs just never had one myself
i adopted a beautiful tuxedo kitty named mc hammer about years ago the shelter wasnt specific but it was very obvious somebody beat the hell out of the poor thing before she found her way back to the humane society i m glad that my girlfriend and i ended up with her because i could see someone with less paitence giving her back roughly sometime in the past year and a half she started to really warm up to us and shes the sweetest animal ive ever met good for you for making that doggo feel loved and safe
my brother got a pit bull beagle mix that had abusive owners before as well i don t know what it was that triggered it but he used to literally piss himself if i got too close it took almost two years but now i am probably his third or fourth favorite person and he comes to me and hides behind my legs if he s ever in a situation where he feels too stressed out it feels good
will forever baffle me how anyone can inflict harm onto something like chloe just look at the love she has to offer
she‚Äôs the bestest ever welcome her and make sure she has plenty of scritches
this makes me so happy about weeks ago i had a similar situation and it made me feel very happy that the dog would trust me and i was so proud of the dog to overcome whatever fear he was facing to let me pet him i love dogs
how can she identify which humans have penises or who otherwise identify as men
first time and you caught it in tape what a coincidence
after my parents passed away i had to check in their house while we were getting ready to sell it one day i did a walk through and when i came to the front door there was this huge pit bull at the door he was was full of scars and fresh scabs all over his face when i opened the door he charged into the house running circuits around the kitchen i tried to calm him down but he was too excited he seemed friendly despite his appearance my sister had a great dane that passed away years earlier so i set up the enormous crate we had in the abandoned house he must have been crate trained because he would get into the crate on command my wife and i searched for local pitbull rescues and kept him at the house i found myself excited to stop by because of his loving energy we found a pitbull rescue and through them found out a neighbor found a female around the same time as when we found our guy we met up and it was obvious they new each other she looked like she had reared many litters some time later wee found out that our neighborhood was a dumping ground for a pitbull fighting ring i didn t know what to call the dog so i spent days calling different names to him one day i called out boots and he came running to my side everyday for months i came to my parents house and took boots for a walk he was energetic and loveable everyone in a while we d meet up with someone and he d turn totally feral i could barely keep him contained otherwise he was the sweetest thing even he was too much dog for my wife and i to keep in our apartment and we eventually found him a home some burly harley riding beast of a man that already had three rescued pitbulls he gave us money for taking care of the dog even though we insisted that it wasn t his responsibility he renamed him bruce bruce obviously his name wasn t boots this was years ago bruce and his owner have since passed away but i always think of them bruce
what a sweety i need to visit a shelter soon i need a dog in my life again
dogs are the greatest i‚Äôm going to miss mine so much when she‚Äôs gone years old and recently diagnosed as diabetic stressful time
fear of men wtf this from the same species that sniff butts as a greeting
offtopic question how many times did u held the cam just to see that she runs away
and you had to film it and trade it in for internet points we suck
you ve been filming yourself trying to pet a dog for over a year
that‚Äôs a happy and trusting doggy now take care of her
what a good human congratulations on the new level of trust
damn this must have been such an amazing feeling for you
i doubt dogs know what a man is don t be ridiculous honestly before you downvote me or say awful things to me try to find it in your soul to agree with me this is just a basic gif of a dog being pet you people will cling on to any story even if it s fake
gaining a dog s trust is the best feeling in the world
back in the day i had a outdoorsy job and the boss used to bring in her dog similar situation the dog was afraid of men due to her previous owner it took me most of the summer to get her to even sniff my hand by the end of the summer my new job was to take her out into the field to play when the boss was too busy it felt so good to finally earn her trust this here is a momentous occasion indeed
my girl friend is deep into rescue i work with tons of dogs over a year i‚Äôm sad for the dog congrats for your help and the help of all of those who contribute to saving these innocent lives
this was my parent s puppy when i was in high school we got her from a shelter and she was very afraid of both my father and me over the course of many years she learned that my father and i were the ones who had the best laps and would give her extra treats
look at that happy face i m really happy you got to experience this thank you for posting it
i never had a pet before can dogs actually differentiate between humans by genders or do they just know what a male voice sounds like and what a female voice sounds like
my current dog not really mine my families dog has a mild fear of men due to my ex step dad i am pretty much the only man she doesnt flinch at or cower around shell actually cower under me women shes fine with if not a little skiddish but god forbid a man walk her way its really heart breaking but shes getting better usually if i get down on a knee and baby talk her she will let whoever im tryna get her to come around pet her and she has never bitten anyone outside of our own home she is defensive against rough housing in the home but outside the home ive actually gotten in a fight while taking her on a walk and she ran away rather than attack the person lol
did that dog just assume your gender this is beyond science
what is it with dogs being afraid of men honestly what is it with some men when we first adopted our dog he was fine with my wife but terrified of me took close to a year for him to let me pet him now years later he s a friendly amp confident goofball but man
my dog had the same thing when we rescued him he still gets paranoid if you try to cuddle with him and he didn t initiate it
she had that face of ‚Äúyou know what man you‚Äôre alright in my book i love you‚Äù
my dog was terrified of men two years ago she‚Äôs now pretty okay with them
petition to invent virtual pets so i can virtually pet this good doggo
my little rescue terrier is was like that too i was really wary of keeping her when my wife was convinced it would be fine it took a week or two but she‚Äôs my little shadow now she‚Äôs even gotten better around other men over the six years we‚Äôve had her though it usually takes a little while before she will get close to them
and you just happened to be taking a video of the ‚Äúfirst time‚Äù
i love how enthusiastic both of you are good on you good human goddamn she s a cute pupper
my former massage therapist‚Äôs dog was unexplainably scared of me kept growling and barking at me every time i came over for a massage still barking at me an hour after i don‚Äôt think there was a dad in that house and she has a sister so i think the dog was afraid of men i feel for that achievement of yours as there seemed like not much i can do to quiet the dog it was a little frustrating imagine you‚Äôre being massaged on the massage table and through the hole your face rests on you see a little dog barking at you hurting your ears with their pitch not very agreeable i kind of felt bad for the dog though
this is so amazing as a dog walker i‚Äôve met a lot of dogs who can only be walked by females because they‚Äôre afraid of men seeing this post makes me so happy
i know a dog just like that and she finally did it after seven years it was the proudest i‚Äôve ever been of anything alive
i know from a lot experience that it takes a special type of person and a lot of patience to break this sort of barrier often times humans have the tendency to react emotionally when an animal behaves in a way that is less ideal towards them these types of emotional reactions would in a lot of cases cause the relationship to break down and leads so some terrible situations that would perpetuate the behavior i m very happy to see something like this it warms my heart good on you if everyone had this level of compassion the world would be a better place
the power of perseverance you should feel very happy and proud you just returned faith and trust to that dog in men i feel very happy when i see this sort of stories
we adopted a yr old cat couple yrs back that didn t like men either today the wife is super jealous with how much of a suck she is with me lol
fear of men as in men the male human or people in general
i don t know the history of my rescue girl but she hates men and children she had been in and out of the humane society and they told me later they were disappointed to hear it was a man that came to see her she had been assumed to be a shelter dog because the odds of her being adopted were so low she has adapted so well over the past years it takes time but they can change
my neighbor s dog used to be like that she would nip at my ankles when i walked her and gave me the side eye from the furthest corner in the room now she just huffs at me and waits for butt scratches edit i would watch take care of her when the neighbor was out of town
i have a dog with trust issues and it sucks as a parent you just want them to be happy and care free but you know it s not that simple we can t just explain to animals that it s okay we can t just undo the pain they felt from their previous owner our jack russel has been to trainers that say she ll just never be the same some just won t work with her because she s just too scared i wish our girl could ever have the satisfaction of being petted without the fear but it just won t happen breaks my heart
if only human women knew that not all men are the same
my friends cat is the same way not just men but everyone new i m the only person other that her owners that let s me pet her
i m in bed and now i have to find my dog and pet her
op better start recording because i know right now is the time she s going to let me pet her for the first time in more than a year ü§î
i have a stray cat in my neighborhood i call her peanut butter and she is very skittish when she came over to me and rubbed my legs after months of hanging with her it was the best feeling in the world happy you got that too
our rescue was the same way with my the men in my family would only stay with my little brother and mom but now our dog gets really jealous when my dad gives anyone attention
looks like in this scenario you re the good boye op
or you just made a video of you petting your dog and made up some bullshit
animals seem to identify gender there is a bird at a local sho near me they claim she loves men she attempts to climb up atop every man and ignores every woman
an old client of mine had a greyhound that was terrified of men she came home to me playing fetch with it in the backyard and getting zoomied on and giving pats she was gobsmacked and asked what i did i told her i d been coming to her place with dried liver treats all week and leaving one closer and closer to me everyday while i ate lunch the day before she ate a bunch out of my hand after that we were buddies
something smells like bullshit here too virtue y to be honest
yeah but how does a dog behave around a transgender person can the dog still understand if they are a man biologically and will be skittish scared serious question and not trying to offend anyone
i love that there are still things that of us can cheer this is one of those things good for you op
if i may what happened during her previous ownership
one of my friend s dogs is like that too terrified of most men her owner is the only exception and me apparently i give good scritches it s a really good feeling when a dog knows that you re more trustworthy than most people
at my old job we had a dog that would snap at anyone that got too close to her after like months i sat down with her and she jumped on my lap and started to lick my face all it took was lots of time and for me to show her i wasn‚Äôt a threat
thats the same for my wifes cat severely scared of men it took years for her to be comfortable with my bumbling antics now i can be me and go pet her without fear of needles scraping me
fear of men man shut the fuck up dude what s next fear of food fear of chimpanzees
if you simply identified as a woman it may not have taken so long
what if i look like a cis man but identify as a queer woman i hope this dog isn‚Äôt assuming my gender smh
that s really nice i love it when you make friends with an animal who s always been hostile to you i work with dogs and years ago had a client with a smallish black dog almost identical to chloe this dog had been a raging whirlwind of aggression her whole life and at was only just starting to mellow out for ages she d growl and me and attack me when i was reaching under to put the harness on etc then one day out of the blue she just decided she didn t have a problem with me anymore and she came right over and put her head on my lap and had her ears scritched for mins she was my best bud after that
that s amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è on a side note a little doggie was outside a store i went to with my fiance right next to the recycle station and when my boyfriend went past it didn t mind at all but as i walked past it it freaked out as if it s life depended on it turns out it was afraid of men but even though i m a woman it reacted to me and not my fiance as my hair was cut very short and his was very long saddest misunderstanding i ve experienced in a while üò¢üòÖ
i hope this post doesn t get blammed for a slight undertone of negativity like i ve seen other awesome posts like this congratulations on the strengthened relationship
downstairs neighbor had a dog that would leap over the garden gate and run away if i had to go through the garden it horrified me to think of what some guy had to have done to her to make her that afraid of men loving home eventually eased her fear some and she would just bark at me the whole time good luck chloe
such a good feeling to finally earn that trust we took in our current cat almost six years ago and i only recently got belly privileges even though i‚Äôve been affectionate with him from day one she looks super happy about those scratches congrats
mark that weird guy is in our backyard again messing with the dog the neighbors probably
bullshit i ve dealt with dogs that hated men and they don t all of a sudden be ok with you it s a slow and very careful process you flinch they get scared and it s back to the beginning this post is shit
you re a good man she s a brave lady very happy for you both
have you had your camera out filming each previous attempt and failure
it‚Äôs taken me over years for my aunts dog to warm up to me or any other dark haired males her pup also got terrified of yellow gloves he was never aggressive just extremely skittish luckily after years of barking and running away he has finally let me pet him and will approach me himself we think his said fears originated from him being mistreated at the shelter she got him from
look at this person s posting history folks several posts a day desperately trying to get viral quite successful too over karma in months he she made this up ffs it s a video of someone petting a dog i don t regret watching it though
on a lighter note my dog doesn t like labs or goldens we have no idea why he gets very barky around them which is a shame because they are sweet dogs
not only do you get to pet her but she obviously likes you
my dog kira was not only sexist but also racist she was bred from an illegal heart worm farm and never forgot the black man who seemingly beat her it was such a problem because many of my friends were black i never figured out how to stop her from nearly biting some friends once she knew them she was great but they couldn t raise their hand well my grandpa who i was taking care of was an asshole and she developed a hate for older white old men as well she was such a protective dog but so incredibly stubborn when a black man or old white man came in she would growl and show teeth with hackles so i would have to stand between her and then and slowly command someone how to get her use to them usually involving me holding her collar and telling them to trust me and petting her she never forgot the type of person who wronged her her and my grandpa finally saw eye to eye but she would still howl at him when he would try to command anything she also used to talk back to him in a type of chewbacca growl i remember being with my fianc√© and we were about to have a ton of fun in the car when i heard her speaking i tried to ignore it but i couldn t after five minutes so i marc sure enough i am listening and realize my grandpa is trying to get her off the couch and she is making the chewbacca voice i went in and was like kira come on and she grabbed the leash in her mouth waiting for me my grandpa said something and she ran over where he was sitting she was so intelligent but stubborn women or children who were black could come in and she would just be a lovable dog only black men and white old men had to be careful no play fighting though near her for a week until she knew ya no other dogs and walking up to my mother as a stranger was a huge mistake
my best friend s dog ghost that he got a year and a half ago is extreeeeemely skittish around people and only trusts my friend the previous owner was terrible so whenever i got within ghost s meter radius he would cower away with his tail between his legs after a year of knowing ghost he finally let me pet him just once after i gave him several treats along with my friend helping convince ghost that i was friendly however he still doesn t trust me much
probably been holding in a huge fart for this very moment
licking the side of her jowls like that is a sign of anxiety and you can see her do that when she walks up
my mom s dog was the same she growled and hid from my dad for over a year thank you for showing her love my mom s dog doesn t exactly love my dad but he occasionally goes to him for scratches
i used to care for a dog like that the first time she let me pet her she also gave me a quick lick on the face i nearly died ü•∞ü•∫
how does a dog tell male and female apart tone of voice what if the woman has a deep voice
op has been waiting for over a year to give pets that‚Äôs why he gives such good ones
i‚Äôve been having a pretty shitty day and this gif changed all of that thank you so much
it seems like dogs can tell the difference pretty quick mine knows the difference between male and female too a couple years ago our family dog saw my mom and a guy shouting at each other he was looknig for one of my shitty aunties and shit aunt gave her address as ours and the dude thought we were hiding her and she the dog scared the guy off my dog is equal parts dumb as a post and smart as hell from then on she started growling at tall skinny dudes and gave them warning barks if they got too close anybody that was chunky a woman or a child was good to go even if they dressed in a non gender conforming way we think it s a smell thing
my little rescue dog was scared of my boyfriend for over a year it took her watching my elderly dog loving up on my bf to learn that he was not a scary human and that mom me wasn‚Äôt the only safe person in the world it‚Äôs sad that they go through that fear but it makes me so happy when animals learn to love humans after having a rough past
just takes time and understanding of the situation üëçüëçüëçüëç
gt her first time yeah yeah i ve read a lot of that online op
that s so sad when animals are scared of a certain gender when it could be twice the pets
usually this is a down vote because fuck stupid pet videos but but this is awesome
that is one lethal tail wag so awesome to see chloe loving her new friendship
cool that was a commitment good on you reap the rewards
my brother rescued a mini aussie that came from an abusive home her owner went as far as to piss on her it to her forever just to get used to him let alone me but the first time she just laid next to me while licking my ear lol i literally almost kidnapped her lol she is the sweetest thing she just needed a good home ‚ô•Ô∏è üè†
ok you are the most thoughtful angel thank you for posting and mostly thank you for being so good to this sweet girl
what kind of dog is that looks exactly like a few year older version of mine
that smile is great confirming that you are an ok hooman and your pets feel good too
butt scratches are a solid way to gain canine friendship lol
i wish i lived in such a dog positive environment your property sounds like heaven very cool of you to welcome the neighbors dogs over
my shepard had that same fear of men she was a rescue and mostly got over it with my husband however she always wary as she got older she started having terrible dementia and completely reverted back she would cower whenever he came near i was the only one she would follow i felt bad for my husband who spent years walking her and at the end couldn t pet her unless he wanted her upset we miss her
my beagle has always been scared of men unless it was me or my dad had him years now he‚Äôs finally let other men get near him without his beagle howls progress even at old ages feels good
looks like she loved it hope she gets lots more petts
and you were recording just as it happened how lucky
a few minutes before was the first time i was ecstatic and wanted to catch it on camera so i moved away and sat down and started to record sure enough she came for more you guys are seeing the second time ever but a few minutes before this video was the very first thats why she seems confident i could show a video next time i see her of how scared she is i have to be seated and virtually motionless except my hand or head for her to come up
dear mods please don‚Äôt look at this as sad content it‚Äôs a beautiful and happy moment of breaking down a barrier that honestly i have been working towards for a very long time i love this dog and her actually coming up to me so i could pet her made my whole week its a success story not a sob story please understand that this is happy content
i m not crying you re crying good work op give her lots of treats and have a poor man s gold üòäüèÖ
someone should tell your dog it s being incredibly sexist by thinking all men are evil and not giving them a chance based on one bad experience
this video refuses to play and i‚Äôm really frustrated
i have a genuine honest question about dogs that fear men after trauma i‚Äôm super curious if their cues of what men look like are from our appearances or maybe a sense of smell if female appeared like a stereotypical male would the dog be afraid of them what about trans men would this dog fear trans males
damn you video tape every instance when you might be able to have that first pet
she s a cautious lady but you obviously passed her test and it is a wonderful feeling having the trust enjoy right now i m trying to type around my cat s tail
my friend had a dog like this but when i first met it he told me she didn‚Äôt like men and the dog walked right up to me and let me pet her
this warms my heart my aunt‚Äôs rescue dog was fearful of men for a long time when we moved in with her a year ago the poor pup was always very hesitant around my husband nowadays when he comes home from work she follows him around the house just so happy her man is home
sometimes i ll meet a dog on the street and give it a stroke and the owner says oh she doesn t usually like men i never know quite how to take that either a the dog has detected i m not a real man ‚Ñ¢ or b dogs love me so win
such a sweet lady lt thank you for showing her kindness
i m skeptical this is the first time it just doesn t seem apprehensive for it s first time feels like trying to get more karma for a better story
so what you re saying is you have successfully convinced a dog that you are a woman
i did that with one of my friends dogs after only a few hours at her house she said i m the only man he doesn t try to bite or bark at also if i don t see the dog for a couple of weeks it ll take a while for him to remember me
dogs don t actually develop fear of humans based on things like gender race etc they are actually just responding to the unconscious body language and cues of their owner
good job man my dog is terrified of my dad but not me or one of my brothers might be because they have beards
that s really good we got a dog from the rspca but she was too afraid we had her for weeks and then she just snapped and went for my sister and me i hope she is doing well like she was afraid of everything but she was too confident so she would do something and then get to scared
i wish to buy the biggest billboard known to man and show the world chole s beautiful smile
wow that s beautiful she s an old lady now isn t she
see all your high school rejection finally paid off you learned how to wear them down respect
my dog does the same thing too she will occasionally come by and stop for scritches her body language is just like in the video she parks her bum nearby and waits for petting or massaging her hind quarters with my fingers then she opens her mouth like that and does a series of happy panting noises which i ve learned is the dog equivalent of laughing
a friends cat is the same he will sit in only my lap but i can t move at all i even have to breath different so he doesn t get scared
my brothers dog likes women without exception but is agressive towards men it takes most a while to gain her trust it took me about minutes and i m extremely flattered kudos for persistence it looks like shes already benefiting from her newfound trust in you
my friend had a dog that she explained to me was traumatized by a previous male owner so she the dog has always been weary cautious around men when she the dog joined me on the couch and let me pet her for the first time i felt like a goddamn disney princess
a fear of men must have been a really terrible previous owner for that to happen
bless you kind stranger for your patience and persistence
did anyone else see those teeth at the first few secs looks like she was yawn lol
how do i widepeepohappy in a way that people understand twtich broke me
most fucking heartwarming video on this site don t me
it took me years with my bosses dog now she won t stop following me i got work to do
i volunteer at a shelter and gaining the trust of a scared dog is one of the greatest feelings in my life
now you re friends for life patience amp kindness rewarded
how can you be fucking mean to a dog that little smile awesome
my friends dog is scared of men with the exceptipn of my friend and a few others not from past experiences or anything of the sort but no one really knows why i ve managed to feed her some food and give some pets a couple of times but she is very cautious very sad
you are so full of shit doubt you even claimed this dog was years old this dog is at least if not over
this is the best feeling my rescue wouldn t go anywhere near men when she came to live with me and my wife it took months until she casually plonked her self on top of me one day now she s like my shadow
this honestly looks like your own old dog that you just called over and filmed and everyone upvoted you because they re a moron
my baby girl was terrified of men when we first got her she wouldn t eat if my husband was in the room and tended to stay away from him now she couldn t care less if he s offering food or pets she s right there she will however bark at any strange man that goes near my mom she does this run up and sniff run away and bark routine
i have a parrot who s exactly like this has been neglected his whole life he s about years old and so we ve been introducing him to the outside world and all sorts of new things let me tell you i ve never seen a parrot this grateful to be alive he changed from an aggressive and scared lil dude to the most affectionate hugger that loves kisses and scratchies on his head and just in months
that s brilliant shows what an amazing job your neighbour has done in reassuring her and also you for your patience around her nice one
my mom rescues busted dogs and i can verify this is the best feeling
can dogs really differentiate between man and women
to have enough patience to do this means you are a good human being people just expect dogs to want to be stroked and play but they are the same as people and not always as confident as you d like good job
anyone else think it s kinda weird how dogs can discriminate based on human sex it s not like i can tell a dog s sex until they roll over
i absolutely love this used to work at a shelter and had an awesome time seeing dogs finally give in to their new forever parents find it super interesting that has you worded the title any differently this would have been lost in new as ‚Äúguy pets old dog‚Äù
we adopted a greyhound it took him a year to be relaxed with me too worth the effort
keep doing your best to show her she doesnt have to be scared of most men or people in general
ive had different friends‚Äô dogs adore me where they say usually their dog hates or is terrified of men so either i‚Äôm actually a lady or dogs just like me i‚Äôll take the confidence boost regardless congrats on your new pal
my dog loves men she s a miniature jack russell and she loves the stronger rubs that guys give her
my friend s dog is super skittish around people other than his owners and for two solid years he wouldn t let me anywhere near him and would keep barking at me one day he stopped barking and laid down on my feet and let me get him but that s not the greatest part of the story we went to a yappy hour at a local brewery where people bring their dogs and money raised goes to the local animal shelter this dog got really nervous around all the other people there and despite his owners being right there he hid behind me since then his barks at me when i go over changed from a why are you here bark to a omg you re back i missed you bark and i love it so much
i m glad you said developed a fear rather than saying she was abused many dogs just have an irrational fear of things and people falsely cry abuse
it s kinda sad people think you are faking this and asking you to scare the dog you have clearly been trying to gain her trust for a while and it s very healthy for her to be able to place trust in men going forward also i mean if she just runs from you when you walk near her then you wouldn t really be doing anything excessive to scare her i suppose either way good job op
my mom s lab is the same way she won t let me near her if i let her in and i m standing where she needs to walk she won t come in she s great with the kid though and she loves my mom
this is happy yet sad the reason for the fearfulness of the dog made me call my girl dog over for a cuddle glad chloe found a better place with a lovely neighbor
nothing better than giving a scared doggo a butt rub
my mother inlaw has a dog in a similar boat the dog was used as a breeding dog for years likely in a puppy mill i reported the guy who originally had her but nothing came of it she s extremely scared of men and at the sound of any thud or movement behind her she sprints off she knocked my mother inlaw down one time causing a broken foot the dog had a torn lip and lived with it for years not being able to properly drink water after this dog made the guy tens of thousand of dollars he couldn t be fucked getting it fixed y all know how much it was to surgically fix it it took mins and that pos was telling us about how it s not a puppy mill and this and that basically begging for his life but whatever lilly the dog started coming up to me lately and will wag her tail just a bit however we kind of start at square one when i m petting her and there s a loud noise or if i have to speak in a loud tone to my other dogs i hope that she will come to like me soon i wouldn t ever treat her like what she was treated like but her mommy now loves to her bits even with causing a broken foot üòÅ
it s impressive that dogs can tell the difference between men and women i can t tell the difference between male and female dogs
my dog also gets really defensive against men other than me when i got him from the shelter he was a year or old when the shelter brought him into the room to me me and my gf at the time he walked directly up to me first and i instantly fell in love since then he has reacted very cautiously to any of my male friends that come to my place he loves any girl he meets though it s weird i cant tell if he gets protective of me thinking that someone is going to threaten me or if he gets defensive thinking he being is threatened and what i mean is there are many times that he will just start to shake and crowd closer to me like when people come to our house he will growl and look to me for some sort of approval or confirmation of his reaction other times i have tried to introduce him to friends and he starts to shake and will purposefully put me between him and the new person i have never been abusive towards him but it honestly has made me second guess myself thinking i ve done wrong by him and just dont realize it
my dog also has a fear of men from his last owners i‚Äôm glad you gained her trust and it‚Äôs so gorgeous to see her so at ease and happy
i went to a fair once and there was a shelter with a shed there with dogs and cats and one of the dogs was terrified of my dad
i know that feeling it s great i adopted a semi feral cat who wouldn t let you get within a meter of her when we first brought her home five years and a lot of work later she s now a total lap cat she still doesn t let anyone pick her up but i think she ll give in eventually but the first time she came up to me and presented the top of her head for scritches brought a tear to my eye
that s not the stride of a dog who is wary of someone you ve pet her before otherwise she wouldn t be rubbing all up on you like that and there would be way more skittish behavior why do you lie
this is just a treasure please let her know she‚Äôs a good girl lt
if you brought a trans girl to chloe would she be fearful
i had a similar story we had a dog extremely aggressive barking and all towards men and also with a nasty background of killing and biting i wouldn t even give him his food but after a couple of months i thought he was ready and opened the door a bit to give him his bowl it ended so well he was subject to multiple pets every shift at the end of the process i m happy he could overcome his fears thanks to me and other male volunteers
how do dogs know what gender people are since we‚Äôre all wearing clothes
how about dude that s what i named my golden yellow lab mix and he s the best hunting partner i have
we have an eskie mix and my wife was really excited to see that yours was nice fluffy boi

i have an year old dachshund that i raised and was my first dog as a man out on my own i joke to myself that he is going to be the oldest living dachshund in history he s got a long way to go
sweet i have an american eskimo too and he just turned
that s pretty amazing the dog was there as you went from kid to adult i wonder if he she was aware that you changed
my american eskimo is years old this makes me happy‚ù§Ô∏è
dog‚Äôs profile looks very much like that of an arctic fox‚Äîadorbs go pats
my eskie is about to turn first puppy i‚Äôve ever had she‚Äôs my best friend happy birthday to your fur baby

at the bottom left you look like the son of tormund and jon snow
my oldest boy looks a lot like him i‚Äôm getting kind of emotional just writing this as he is now and having some health problems i love seeing dogs that look like him though makes me super happy and reminds me of when he was younger his name is mr noodles by the way i was when we got him and i named him i‚Äôm an only child and he‚Äôs grown up alongside me like a sibling
i love american eskimos my childhood dog was an eskie he died at due to pancreatic cancer he was such a good boy
awwww is that different from a japanese spitz or same breed different names i have a japanese spitz who just turned he‚Äôs in my post history
pic of you as a kid looks like a norman rockwell painting lol
cute but why the fuck is it s name pronounced xylophone google it
also devils that enjoy eating birds they have fangs
pretty sure that s a klipspringer kid still super cute
never did a dik looks so cute and adorable like ever
is this the baby version of one or are they all this adorable
yes the other users who ve pointed out this is a klipspringer and not a dik dik are correct amp x b fun fact both dik diks and klipspringers are bovids meaning they re more closely related to cows and goats than they are to deer
dik diks look like they have tick ticks not today lyme disease not today
my dik dik is tiny and adorable too well at least that‚Äôs what i‚Äôm told
my is that little dik dik furry and impressive the way that bottle fits in its dik dik opening
well that‚Äôs about the cutest thing i‚Äôve seen all day
there is a dik dik at the sf zoo and it‚Äôs always my goal to find him during a visit apparently they like to hide
this and the elephant shrew are my favorite animals
not the worst thing to be airdropped in fact probably the best
next time try this someone used airdrop to send this to me
i‚Äôm pretty sure there is a small cat sitting on her nose
i have android you can just send anything to any random stranger you are near on apple
oh my god for a second i thought someone had thrown you this little fur ball at the bus
awww that s a super cute one you sure are lucky to have gotten one
oh my i may need to do this with some of my cute cat pics ‚ù§Ô∏è
it looks like it was just at the vet my friend s cat looked like that after getting some teeth removed
this is a silly cat the expression alone makes it super obvious
it s all fun and games until you get airdropped an unwanted penis
i m glad to know someone else airdrops things to strangers on public transit i do it all the time
someone airdropped me end game at school today i am also pleased
airdropped this to me on the bus what does that even mean
don t see how i m claiming to own the cat but ok mods
old man looks great at glad he has a new roommate to help keep him young
thats what they all say i don t want that stupid cat or dog and a couple weeks later you find them taking a nap on the couch together
my dad was so against my dog when i got her years later she still lives with him and sleeps with him every night shes not really my dog now lol
the man isn‚Äôt looking too bad for his age this nonetheless puts a smile on my face
come on man this exact post was posted back in december with over k upvotes
for the entire time ive been alive my dad has sworn up and down he is allergic to cats even from a young age i knew that was bullshit he got me a cat because he felt guilty about giving away my dog behind my back while i was sick and now you can obviously tell he loves my cat your dad obviously loves your cat with the way he s cradling her like a baby and the fact the cat has such a spoiled look on her face
new repost account right here if you see and post with lt lt in the title its probably the same guy
i never thought i‚Äôd like cats until i took care of one üòÇ
he does not look like he is f amp ‚Äù he is just inspecting you
for your sake i hope it leaves by morning their version of a rooster crow sounds like human lady murder screams
my friends farm has peafowl they like to explore and sometimes just leave with turkeys and geese they loose one or two a year from adventuring
hope you weren t looking forward to sleeping anytime soon those things are beautiful beautiful screeching monsters
that s me every day pretty much they re all over my neighborhood someone that lived in the area years ago raised them in pens and when the city expanded and told him he couldn t raise them inside city limits he just opened the latch on the coup and they all spilt now there s a whole population of them that live here
do you live next to a goddamn zoo because if not i think this could be a gateway to a much bigger issue
this used to happen to me all the time as a kid the junkyard down the street kept them to frighten people off and sometimes they‚Äôd break free and hang out in our yard
fun fact these fuckers are loud and annoying as hell sounds like kids screaming from time to time
i think of them as drag queen turkeys yeah i m weird lol
i have of them in my backyard and they each shit like a horse but their beauty and intelligence is beyond compare except for the shitting of course
it s been there for a very long time ebaum s world has it in
the bluebird of happiness long absent from his life ned is visited by the chicken of depression gary larson so i d guess that this is the peacock of unmanaged expectations
many people keep peacocks as pets they make amazingly good guard animals and rarely feel the need to leave where they are chances are your neighbor has a peacock
there are like in my neighborhood i pulled up in my driveway one day and they flew onto the roof they sound like screaming children at night
i was once on a cross country road trip and stopped in a middle of nowhere town in south dakota with a population of featuring a gas pump an abandoned church and a few trailers me and my friends are stretching our legs and filling up gas while i walk around some thickets to take a piss when i run into a massive peacock that proceeds to fully spread out its feathers we hadn‚Äôt seen a single person for hours this town seems nearly abandoned by all life and here comes this huge majestic creature out of nowhere it‚Äôs must‚Äôve been an exotic pet of one of the town‚Äôs few residents regardless was a surreal experience i‚Äôll never forget
i only see one could be masturbating but definitely not fucking
isit safe to ket it lick the baby i love these videos but i dont know this side
inb omg that baby is in danger what terrible parents omggggg
i am doggo the protector i will defend until oooooh yeah sooo goood
the slight wave of the body almost makes them look animated super cute aaaand adding a ferret to the list of animals i want but dont want to clean up after unless i have lots of money
this little guy is living the relaxing life better than me üòÑ
if you can find someone offering watsu you can have someone do this to you
i want to type buizel but i feel like i‚Äôll be ridiculed for it
always wanted to get a ferret hear they can be kind of a pain to own though
that tiny swimming ring around his neck is killing me
i bet he held a piece of bread in his mouth and the pigeons were just discussing is this a trap
i thought it was someone‚Äôs back and head with their hair in a ponytail
seriously amazing one of the most spectacular pictures i ve ever seen
when people make up these descriptions of what happened do they not even concern themselves with the mechanics of what they re describing like have you seen a pigeon in your life is it the size of a large dog that it can look down on a human holding a camera
what you see when your parents first learn how to use skype
hay who does dis putz think he izz woungin around on your floor
looks like two elderly parents trying to figure out how to work the webcam on their computer
what you see when you look up and realize they expect you to fit both in your mouth at once sorry the thought occurred to me and i had to haha
excuse me sir do you have a moment to talk about our lord and savior
i read this as the pigeons were lying on the ground
or an epic rap bring the bread or feel my dread i m aiming for your head you be dead i tread you feed now we try and one will die only i will fly no heaven s wings i watch you fry and sing to your cries
the photographer should be thankful the pigeons weren t perched over his her head
what kind of pigeons approach a human this closely they would have needed to be standing almost on top of the photographer isn‚Äôt it more likely that someone set up a camera on the floor and left it there a reverse search shows that this image has been around for a few years but this thread is the only place claiming that the pigeons came up to a photographer lying on the ground i think op found the image and created an interesting but fake story about it
concerned definitely these pigeons want to collect that five large you owe big bird
i ve seen movies i know this guy is about to get whacked
you re about to be offered up as a sacrifice to the pigeon god
i m also concerned about how similar those pigeons are down to the feather
harold i think we got ourselves a live one over here amp x b oh henry
‚Äúand let that be a lesson to you we ever catch you around here again you‚Äôre gonna be fish food which we will also eat because we‚Äôre pigeons ‚Äù
the photographer never knew why the council of pigeons wanted him removed and he never will
these pigeons look like mafia thugs about to bounce this dude out of the cathedral
pigeons are not nearly tall enough to stand over a photographer i call bs
last thing you see when you run out of bread crumbs
is this food bob i don t know sharon let s peck it and find out
what the main character sees in shadow of the colossus
looks like some kind of pigeon protection racket and the photographer hasn t paid up this month
looking like theyre about to drop the hottest demo tape
looks like they‚Äôre about to drop the hottest of albums
it s a leaked scene from the new tarentino flick the hallway birds
i ve read through every comment so i could upvote an inivetible pigeon blow job joke but nobody has made one yet and i m not witty enough to come up with one
do you think he s dead jim i don t know chuck let s walk on his face a bit and see if he reacts sounds like a plan if he s dead check his pockets he might have snacks ooo great idea also grab that camera we can pawn it and buy more snacks i like the way you think jim
send it in to national geographic for photo contest
this is what my pizza sees before my husband and i kill it
ok google what is the last thing a piece of bread sees
that didn‚Äôt happen nothing ever happens that‚Äôs the same pigeon just one is flipped and made to look closer to the camera
someone is trying to access your phone we took a picture
this was the first post i ever saw on reddit quit reposting it
they re not deciding whether to poop on him they re deciding where
honestly thought i was looking at the backs of two dark haired women with white hair ties looking at the ceiling instead they were curious pigeons til
this is straight up photoshop you can see that the bird yes one bird because they‚Äôre duplicates had been placed in an irrelevant photo
looks like my mom and dad the day my report card came in the mail
when you accidentally turn on the front facing camera
let s guess which filters that image was dragged through
i really love pigeons ever since i read the provost s dog trilogy by tamora pierce
‚Äúi think he‚Äôs dead ‚Äù ‚Äúhow do you figure ‚Äù ‚Äúhe aint moving ‚Äù
is he holding the camera against the ground pidgeons aren t very tall
i m imagining these two voices by the old man muppets shouting bad bird related puns to each other and laughing uproariously at this guys expense
birb with new york accent ey yo so uhhhhh what can we do for yas
anybody wanna go down a fun rabbit hole look up muqarnas those weird little things on the edges of the ceiling it s a weird thing to learn about
it‚Äôs literally a photoshopped image of the same pigeon just rotated how do people think this is real
kevin eventually recovered from his injuries but he never ever kicked a pigeon again ever
is this the new installment of the boondock saints franchise
who said you could look at our ceiling pal where is the looking tax we need
when your parents video call you for the first time
this could very well be the cover of a very thuggish ‚Äôs hip hop rap album cover that i would not hesitate buying
even with the photographer laying on his back just how big are these pigeons to stare directly over the lens
disapproving pigeons do not care for your shenanigans
my ex husband and i raised racing pigeons i had to sell them after he went to prison it was a very hard decision this picture made me miss them and i don t think i ve thought about them in years
sir have you fallen and can t get up would you like us to call somebody

sort of reminds me of a time i was walking through my pasture after having sort of a rough week i sat down on a fallen fence post and just sort of zoned i m sitting there about minutes when i hear something behind me turned around and the entire herd of cows is in a half circle around with heads down sort of staring they were trying to figure out what the heck i was doing i guess made me laugh and the week got a lot better
pigeon hey pigeon hey man pigeon you okay pigeon you alright dude
you ve come to the wrong neighbourhood motherfucker
it‚Äôs fake the original photo of the two pigeons outside with a clear blue sky was circulating around a while ago
i feel like it would have been easier to just leave the phone on the ground and wait until a pigeon looked at it rather than spending time photoshopping this stupid thing
excuse me sir can you please turn off the flash thanks
dat s what ya get when ya don t pay ya dues doitbag
they look like they‚Äôre about to drop the hottest album of all time
this is a really grainy shitty looking image just saying
this would be a great meme for what you see vs what she sees
‚Äúlisten mate we don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing but we do not approve ‚Äù
seeing as a pigeon is about inches high thats one very flat photographer
this and the steampunk south africans as hanging art pieces in my newly built condo will make me king of the millennials
more like fbi drones wondering why he‚Äôs looking up so much

it looks like they are about to say we are gonna beat yo up
‚Äúyou in the wrong hood little man beat him up boys ‚Äù
excuse me sir we‚Äôre going to have to ask you to leave
government surveillance drones investigating strange behavior
photoshopped birds were imposed afterwards with the way camera lenses work both the pigeons and the roof cannot both be in focus at the same time
the pigeons look like they are loan sharks coming to collect their money or break your knees
this was so much more amazing than i could have hoped

the council of pidgeons has decided your fate mortal
your fate will be decided by the high council pigeons
this time of the month already the staggering amount of reposts on reddit are leading me to become paranoid
"pigeon you poke him
pigeon no you pigeon i let the kid grab me and throw me at that woman remember pigeon he grabbed both of us pigeon let s go find that kid and see if he will grab him"
this reminds me of those what you see vs what she sees memes
looks like they‚Äôre about to tie him up and throw him in a river
i bet they were thinking something like dude if you keep laying there with your mouth open i m going to turn around
looks like the inside cover to a puff daddy produced album
either he is very thin person or this are very large pigeons
i didn‚Äôt scroll all the way down before reading the caption those boys scared the shit outta me
doesnt look good for the camera man one of those pigeons is telling the other one lets poop on him
oh you re finally awake you were trying to cross the border

this is why reddit is golden because of this picture
the pigeons are just standing there wondering what s going on üòÇ

can someone photoshop pidgeons all around the photo pls
quite amazing picture you take for two pigeon with ceiling
what it feels like when you open the front facing camera
this is what a girl pigeon sees when she is giving head
they look like mafia mobsters looking over someone they re about to kill
i had this pic as the background of my phone for a while d
those pigeons don t look concerned they look like they re about to finish you off for betraying them
have you heard i was under the impression that everyone had heard
it looks like the cover for a hip hop album by some angry hardcore rapper pigeons
too bad it‚Äôs fake though you can google ‚Äúpigeons looking down at camera‚Äù it‚Äôs one of the first results would have been so funny if it wasn‚Äôt so fake
the pigeons the fuck you doing around here boy stammering photographer i just wan want a pho photo of of the ceiling the pigeons well we just wanted to shit on someone and you are about to be it we will teach you a lesson in pain bitch
or they were hungry they ll eat almost anything ya know
i m a security guard at a site with a parking garage that has a shitload of pigeons living in it and they always stare at me with a judgemental look they ve started allowing me to get closer though
this is what you see when you get abducted by aliens
kinda reminds me of a scene from orson welles‚Äô ‚Äúthe trial‚Äù
this might not quality as ‚Äúawww‚Äù because of the context but when i od‚Äôd my dog would relentlessly paw at my chest lick my nose and cry louder than i‚Äôve ever heard before she knew it wasn‚Äôt normal for her mom to be on the floor with a blue face and bless her heart she did what she could years clean btw
i can t be the only one who finds this fucking terrifying
madagascar looks like we got a wise guy here huh photographing the ceiling my ass you must take us for a couple a bird brains
me and my boys looking down on racism because that shit is wack af
concerned they look like they re about to fuck some shit up
and that s when brian knew he fucked up and had come to the wrong neighbourhood
they weren t concerned they just asserted their dominance on the photographer
are you sure you didn‚Äôt sprinkle seeds on duct tape over your chest before lying down
why the fuck do people lie in captions and just make shit up
those are pretty obviously the same pidgeon no idea why someone would fake this
the only thing that concerns me is the number of upvotes this bad photoshop with an even worse title has received
"how the fuck is this re reposted pixelated and obviously fake ass shit gets k upvotes smh
the only thing left to do is to gild this crap"
i feel like this could be an accidental wes anderson thing
humans we bout to drop the biggest hit of all time bird language we about to drop the whitest shit of all time
last thing a piece of bread is able to see before die
i can only think of the oddfeathers from animaniacs aww these two are so cute
this is bullshit have to be some tall ass pigeons to do this
such a stupid photoshopped picture man with a nice fake story to go with it
that s a nice camera you have there it would be a shame if it got damaged
sure everything is perfectly in focus let me know which camera can do that and i will order of those
do you smell that jeez it s smell like freaking fake
the last thing the birdseed sees before it meets oblivion
that‚Äôs the same pigeon x fuck you op you‚Äôre a dirty liar
this reminds me of the penguins on the old beekman s world anyone else remember that show
i seen two people with their hair in ponytails at first looking up towards the ceiling
this motherfuckers are about to drop the best fucking mixtape of the century
roo and koo about to drop the hottest album of next decennium
the pigeons reminds me of my parents whenever i fucked up
me and my boi looking down on racism because that shit is wack
he dead yeah he dead come on let s peck out his eyeballs
looks like the photographer just woke up from amnesia and the pigeons are from the secret service
they look like they about to drop the hottest album of k
the photographer forgot she put birdseed on the lens
not only is the story not really believable the photoshop job is really poor you can clearly tell it s a photo manipulation this is fairly innocent but people should learn to read pictures a bit better and practice some healthy source criticism
honestly this has some unexpected alien abduction feel
there are better places to sleep than on the floor you know
i hear suicidal tendencies institutionalized in this photo
why do i feel like those pigeons are gonna kick the shit out of me and take my lunch money
nice photoshop would have upvoted it if it weren t for the deception part
t h e c o u n c i l w i l l d e c i d e y o u r f a t e
what should we do with him i say poop on his camera and car
sorry bout this donnie nothin personal boss says you know too much
"a pretty sure that story is fake
b it‚Äôs the same pigeon photoshopped
c it‚Äôs not even an ‚Äúawww‚Äù moment"
the last thing you see when you re an abandoned cracker
pigeon do u think he is ok pigeon well he is still breathing even tho that big black thing is on his face
how can this have that amount of upvotes when it is obviously a poorly done edit
they look like a couple of british bouncers everything alright here then lads
they ain t concerned they re wondering if he s peckable
photoshopped or not repost or not it provided a shared moment of laughter with my kid when i showed it to them and i‚Äôll take that all day every day
they look like they re about to drop the sickest album this year
they don t look concerned they look like they about to cut a bitch
this looks like it could be the alhambra but i m not sure
these pigeons look like they re about to drop the hottest album of
i don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre concerned i think they‚Äôre asserting pigeon based dominance
what the birdseed sees before i peck it after the old man tosses it in the sidewalk and i fight uncessarily for the only crowded spot with a completely untouched patch only feet away
i never realized what chunky heads they have this is great news
you are being judged by the council it is time to go to court these are your escorts
when you wake up after being resuscitated by pigeons
i thought they were related women with their hair is ponytails
wow before i read the caption i thought it was two asian women back facing hair in buns wearing heavy black coats looking up also i might have had a little to much to drink
what do we do with him he s on our territory we take him back to the boss i imagined this with a bronx accent for some reason i also imaged a pigeon mafia
i think i‚Äôve seen these pigeons before in several other images but i kinda like this scenario
i don t know why but that pup just screams kevin to me
whatever her name is she‚Äôs flippin adorable also i think sydney was always a great dog name
an ewok and a german shepherd took a long walk one evening
so people are even editing dogs‚Äô eyes to be bigger in photos now sheesh
he looks like boxy from the ‚Äôs battlestar galactica
i‚Äôm surprised someone isn‚Äôt breeding him for a need type of mini shepherd
so adorable will it cause any health issues or shorten his her life
i say we were lucky because unfortunately today he passed away but i know he can hear this from heaven i love you buddy
sam was my first dogs name sorry for your loss he looks lovely
the single greatest boy in all of either dogdom or boydom ah hell both

he s been taken like all best bois on a golden chariot up into the heavens where he will be waiting patiently on the rainbow bridge for you üåà‚ù§Ô∏è till you meet again
she is actually very pretty i am not afraid of her at all well maybe just a little
this is only the second snake ever that didn t scare me she looks sweet
beautiful i want the cuddling does she do the neck wrap and nap i m trying to convince the wifey to get a snake as a pet at home so my daughter and a good age to teach them how to treat pets and not to be afraid of everything will get use to it
she looks so cute if only i wasn t terrified of snakes
this is the cutest snake i have ever seen in my life
i don t want to be dramatic but i would die for her
not a snake guy but i ll admit she s a looker what kind of snake is that pretty cool she lets you dress her up
somehow yes and i am snake phobic but yes somehow she is
oh i love the blue eyed ones so uch more then the black but never had a blue eyed they cost sooo much d but look absolutely beautiful lt
that s really cool that you could get a crown on the lil girl
looks like one of my friends who went to coachella recently
i never saw a snake that pure white before shes very pretty all the albinos i saw look a little pink or orange
i like her dapper thermosensory moustache all that s missing is a monocle
she‚Äôs beauty she‚Äôs grace i love her and support her üíê
he looks like he knows things serious things he is also a fine looking turtle
i have a red foot tortoise named chili pepper üå∂ üòä i love people who love turtles ‚ù§Ô∏è
may i point out that pumpkin is not a turtle on world turtle day
i thought there was a giant guillotine in the background
how big is he i can t get a good sense of scale from your pic he looks awesome though turtles are great
it looks like your toe gave him a cute lil boop hat on the head aww
how old is he now and how long will he hopefully expectedly live for
brave to take him out without a leash what if he runs away
he looks like such a sweetheart and it looks like he s enjoying his duck very much üåª
bet you he‚Äôll never destroy that duck toy assuming that‚Äôs his first toy my jack russel mix had a swan toy he loved dearly and never ripped apart but the rest of them he decimated them ü§£
my rocco has that same duck toy his foster gave it to us when we adopted him he sleeps with it every night
im gonna take my boat to the old river im gonna row till i cant no more i got the doggos in the front snow is on his back he looking far out waiting for a fish to come

pitch black water oof i just got some intense anxiety
it s from an instagram account called trailsandbears a local woman is taking rescue dogs for a day in the mountain so it s a cute doggo and a beautiful scenary every day this is a pic of one her dog that passed away recently denali she works hard to get shelter dogs adopted with the exposure enjoy
i wish i could upvote more than once what a good doggo

woof woof what was that lassie there s a loch ness monster out there asking for tree fiddy
mathew posa on youtube has similar frosty pup adventures
this is such a pleasing photo on many levels great job
how has no one posted the dog from planes trains and automobiles
cool picture like really really cool like freezing cool does that doggo need a jacket
good boy for those of you who get that reference lol
i would ask if this is minnesota but there appears to be a mountain in the background and i don‚Äôt recognize that model of canoe
do you mean an ice canoe ride hahahahaha i m done now
and here i am every winter where it only gets down to degrees here begging the weather to get to degrees so i can kayak
this pup should get together with gary the cat and go for epic wilderness adventures
beautiful photo i live in a part of canada where this landscape is not uncommon i am fortunate enough to be able to canoe with my beloved pupper but fuckin buuurrrrr hell no i am not getting in a canoe in the winter
such a beautiful girl i wish you both a lovely life together she is blessed to have you

congrats to you both i have a pomeranian corgi mix so sassy but also a lot of fun your pup looks adorable
it was very pleasing to give this pup her th upvote
take her out to a nice restaurant for dinner and then wipe her makeup off in public
she has a great sence of humor when she is asleep dye her hair in pastel colours paint a huge on her forehead and call her lil lly
suggest you re planning something but never actually do it psychologically damaging if done right
dude i wish i slept as solid as you do lol i wake up when my husband leaves the bed or even just when the fan turns off
is that a pictograph sentence on your forehead what does it say
aw yay i hope my marriage ends up like this üòÑ draw a giant ugly penis on her stomach
i‚Äôve seen other short tailed birds doing this in videos i‚Äôm pretty sure they do this in the wild when we aren‚Äôt videoing them as well funny little fuckers
bird imma get all the ladies with this trick they won‚Äôt know what hit them when i come in with a braided extensions internet üëèüëèüëèüòá the best bird makes video with words and makes it extra adorable
it‚Äôs actually a she and she is chewing these strips to make a nest males are not very good at chewing strips like this source have lovebirds
this is the most adorable thing i‚Äôve ever seen looks at that smile those eyes that cute little wobble i‚Äôm
i already told her the new wig was on the way but ok
‚Äúhey you got a scissors ‚Äù ‚Äúno but you can use my bird ‚Äù ‚Äú what ‚Äù
ohhh notice me horton put down the clover this is your next dooor neighbor calling
petting pretty bird pretty bird who s a pretty bird
i had no idea they‚Äôd do that lol very pretty bird with that fancy tail hehe
wow i have never seen this before how adorable look how neatly she puts them in her feathers üòçüòçüòçüòç
tis a smart little birdo i think it is carrying them to a nest
i was honestly surprised that bird thought ‚Äúoh wait i just put one in on this side better put this in the other way ‚Äù
it knows it‚Äôs wings are clipped and it needs the extra length for flight this is actually a little sad
i know this is a repost but it‚Äôs still cute every time
the way it transitions that paper from one side to another that s just genius
birds are a helluva lot more clever than we give them credit for
whomever shall harm this cute ass birdie will fucking die
need to get him some summer colors you know it s time for summer fashion üå¥üåªüçπ
i was casually smiling until she moved it closer to the camera all with her tongue then my jaw dropped
great now even the clothes designing is going to be taken over by birds
attenborough voice this bird was born gender free it now wants to become a male he‚Äôs trying to build something long and solid what could it be
imagine what birbs could do with human s technology
on youtube i saw a small parrot do this to a calendar that hung above her house i hate calling them cages she would stand on the top of her house amp the calendar was hung so she would barely have to reach up to snip strips from the bottom then she d poke the strips amongst her feathers just like the bird on the vid but she must ve gotten most into her house since she didn t have to fly ever since i ve seen that i thought she was jazzing herself up amp wondered about the behavior but just now learned about it in fact i wouldn t know to call the parrot a her if i didn t read it here so thank u to the op amp commenters who shared their knowledge
i like the way she shuffled it up to the other end at about
i wish my birds did stuff like this all they do is shit and steal apples
birds are just so damn cute but i m scared owning one would be bad for them like not being able to freely fly around would make them sad
hey can someone tell me where i can get these cute pair of scissors
and he better have something nice to say when i go to this much trouble to make myself look nice the things i do for that man and does say he say one nice thing no he just stare at himself in the mirror
just like johnny in short circuit poor bird got beaten up by a couple of thugs now it‚Äôs self upgrading to kick some ass
i m really fascinated by the thought process at the oral dexterity displayed was surprising as well as the transition from a left side hold to a right side hold because she was going to attempt to attach it by turning her head the other way meanwhile most dogs won t realize they can fit the stick through the doorway if they just turn their head
op how long have you been using a comma instead of an apostrophe for the winky face
i do something similar with carrots and my anus my wife hates it but my kids thinks it‚Äôs hilarious next door neighbors not so much but hey it‚Äôs my yard
clip my tail feathers so i can t fly away fuck you bitch i ain t waiting to grow then back
i wish this was a little longer it definitely has some asmr qualities about it
there was i imagine still is a fairly large feral love bird colony in phoenix a storm tore the roof odd an aviary and a ton escaped apparently they can make a decent life in az and stuck around you d see them hitting up recycle bins for paper to build nests and as others have said they aren t very good at holding them or nest building
is it hard to own a bird i really want to get one eventually as they seem very smart and funny is it hard and expensive to take care of them but most importantly would the bird be happy in a house i wouldn t want to get one if they would rather be free outside but if it s beneficial for them then i d love to have one
it can cut things better than i can with scissors ü§î
can you train her to go ding when she gets to the end of a row
proof of birds trying to disguise themselves to deceive us
and the paper coordinates so nicely with his blue feathers üòä
dude is going clubbing primping himself for the ladies birds are fascinating i loved when he decided the paper needed to go on the other side and shifted the whole length of it to the other side of his mouth
as a woodworker my router won t even cut that straight
anybody else hear a typewriter ‚Äúding‚Äù in their head when she gets to the end of each piece
just wondering what happened to his own tailfeathers
smh unrealistic beauty standards for birbs drive them to this
i find this so fascinating and it s cute cute and funny
if you have any dried up palm fronds these guys go nuts for them for building their nests
the volume was uncalled for but i was blissfully surprised
this is so cute i cannot even what do you suppose is his reasoning for sticking the paper in his feathers
lovebirds are weird like that mine were incarnations of satan himself so it‚Äôs nice to see a possibly sweet one
do they do that because they lost their feathers or to attract mates
someone give him something more colorful also to go along with feathers
this is the cutest thing i have ever seen i m melting
i don‚Äôt like birds but this is far too adorable to resist
just trying to make prosthetics to replace their clipped wings
"üé∂i feel sunny
i feel fizzy and funny and fine
and so pretty
miss america can just resign üé∂"
when she moved the strip from one end to another with her mouth i was amazed
who needs scissors for wrapping paper when you have this bird
i despise birds but this was just precious to watch
"there once was a girl bird named gertrude mcfuzz
and she had the saddest plain tail ever was
one droopy droop feather was all that she had
and oh that one feather made gertrude so sad she curled it she dyed it she gave it a puff
she decked it with flowers but it wasn t enough for no matter what it just was what it was a tail that simply wasn t meant
to catch the eye of an elephant the one feather tail of miss gertrude mcfuzz"
at i can see the wheels turning in her little brain when she changes to the other side with a strip
oh my heart this made me a little less afraid of feathered things
just a birb trying to live up to these impossible beauty stabdards
i wish i could have a parrot but i have a compromised immune system
need a new paper shredder what kind of bird is this
hey mom i‚Äôm going out tonight where‚Äôs the gift wrap i gotta look fly
omg he is so cute birds are so much fun we just got chickens and they do silly things like this too there s one that loves putting fruit loops on the tail feathers of her sisters lol
omg he is so cute birds are so much fun we just got chickens and they do silly things like this too there s one that loves putting fruit loops on the tail feathers of her sisters lol
that is probably the goodest of bois if i ever saw one ‚ù§Ô∏è
every time i see this reposted i think how adorable this bird is
omg he s so awesome to see him cutting paper and everything it s so cute no way someone taught him that great
me doing art amp craft i forgot my scissors can i borrow your bird please d
i had a female lovebird as a kid and i paid a lot of damaged book fees at the public library she was uncanny at finding well hidden books to turn into nesting materials
my sister s female lovebird did this when we were young we called her a paper shredder she didn t even attempt to tuck them away or take them anywhere though she seemed to be happy just to have a sheet of paper and turn it into strips of confetti
but why did he do that i am not an animal expert but i am curious
what s this behaviour do they do this in the wild and why
when a video is reposted so many times it has ‚Äúblack‚Äù bars on all four sides
that typewriter move she does at to hold the piece by the other end was pretty slick she makes it look so effortless
that is how they store stuff they find to build nests
government drone attempting to replace its disguise
that s lovely she put the lovebird spell on me i m in love now
i wish i could upvote more than once solely for this video
evolutionarily why would a bird do something like this they dont care about self image i assume so would they dress up to find a mate or is this a learned behavior
get a pair of scissors and cut off a strip of the paper in front of the bird to see its reaction
my god i already wanted a parot but my god i want one even more
birds are the funniest fucking animals on the planet üòÇüòÇüòÇ
i think she wants to fly off so she s trying to get rear tail wing
i raised a baby crow and since then i‚Äôve had such an appreciation on how very smart birds are
awe this makes me miss my parakeet he would just perch on my shoulder all day and hop on my keyboard all the time while i was trying to type haha
she sounds like the hole punch the conductor used in the polar express
first lesson with these little psychos the appear cute and the sound stupid so some kind of cute thats a mistake they are highly intelligent psychos dont show them things you will regret it immediately
first thing out of my mouth ‚Äòyou are shitting me right ‚Äô then i started reading the comments and i kinda still think it‚Äôs unbelievably awesome
did she call it macaroni afterwards i ll see myself out
when iq birb can cut a piece of paper straighter than i can
wasn t planning on crying at work today but this is the purest thing i ve ever seen
wow this makes me miss my two parakeets üòûi love this so much
if you release those birds outside do they fly away or come back
my husky does this too but she does it as an excuse to yell at me it goes big fake yawn then massive cry for attention
my sister trained her dog to fake yawn as a tell for when he needs to go out he will make the yawn noise and everything
yawns are an important communication tool for dogs they can signal all sorts of things stress anticipation or very often non aggression one study concluded that if you yawn and your dog yawns in response it suggests a strong social connection
inb the dogs yawn is real the dudes is fake and the clip has been reversed
how is no one talking about how the brother is a cutie
only because he loves you and doesn t want you look slack jawed all alone deserves a treat
i wish someone looked at me the way the dog looks at your brother
i can only hear the underwater music from super mario bros
pretty sure it‚Äôs a dumbo octopus they‚Äôre super cute
fun fact contrary to popular belief the plural form of ‚Äúoctopus‚Äù is actually ‚Äúoctopuses‚Äù
my only problem with octobros is the amount of mdk you can get just by touching them i know it‚Äôs only a few kinds of them that will kill you blue ringed etc but still ps this thing is adorable as hell
oh my goodness i thought it wasn t real for a minute
it also has an adorable name if it‚Äôs the kind i think it is flapjack octopus
adorabilis my son has a cute book about this little squish
i feel like i d fight one these at level in an mmorpg
it s octopuses now right i can t keep up with this shit
dumbo actually named after the disney character dumbo octopus genus
if not for the internet i would have missed this adorable creature bc it s the internet still not sure it is real and think this is pokemon
isn t this the octopus that looks terrifying as an adult
ah the cute watery monsters from nintendo underwater worlds
the ear flap made me laugh i m sure they help him her get along a little faster
the problem with the dumbo octopus is while the babies look like cute little marshmellows the adults look like satan regurgitated a plastic bag
dumbos are the cutest little cephalopods have you ever seen that video of the marine biologist just talking while they have a live sea cam they encounter one who hides his eyes from the bright light and even they melt
silly fact that i learned recently the plural of octopus is actually octopodes p also cute little fella
there‚Äôs always a bigger fish but i‚Äôm glad this one didn‚Äôt get nom‚Äôd
want to pet slash simultaneously let it tentacle fuck me
wow that s heart wrenching got a little emotional watching that
my heart beats more hastily beautiful life simply because of the actions we express to the person we love
jesus i can t even imagine how horrible life would be without sight and sound i immediately thought of metallica s song one when i read the title not to be a downer sorry for that anyone know if it will even be possible for this child to learn to communicate
i m rocking my almost month old at the moment i just watched this and words cannot express what i m feeling right now
helen keller communicated very well being both deaf and blind as much as it seems like this man loves his child i think the kid will be just fine
beautiful to be loved like that what a special little boy
i know this dad loves this baby and this baby will love his dad but i still feel mad that in this day and age that if we just put enough money into medical research instead of funding the war machine or going all zealous over stuff like stem cell research we could sort out a whole sluice of problems like this in the womb before the little tyke is even born
as unlucky as it would be to be born blind and deaf thank god he s got a dad who loves him and he s a baby born on the cusp of our exponential medical and technical advances maybe one day he ll see and hear
it makes my head hurt just trying to imagine what it would be like to learn teach communication to someone like this sure i understand they communicate via touch like sign language on their palms but how do you teach someone that this means yes if they cant be told shown what any of these weird touches mean let alone this means chair and oh yeah i can t possibly explain to you or show you what a chair looks like or does until you experience it yourself even then it s hard to explain fuck me i need a nap
if you‚Äôre born blind an dead what language would you think in
we should make a calender for those boss eyed children
what an incredibly attuned father this is beautiful i am going to try this with my kids who can see and hear and see the reactions
i work with children who have special needs parents often tell me the most difficult part is not being able to comfort their child parents often blame themselves think they‚Äôre bad people ‚Äî it causes a lot of pain seeing the dad find his way to make his son comforted is such a beautiful thing for both of them
thank you for letting me know they can i once met a blind guy he wasn‚Äôt deaf but his job was fixing vending machines someone asked him questions and he told us that he could tell what was wrong with the vending machine by feel then i watched him feel all over the vending machine and then fixed it with some tools and then it worked smoothly it was so amazing someone who called for repairs had no idea that he was blind he had a coworker who could see and they kinda worked together like he drives and guides him when walking somewhere when he was at the vending machine he was different so confident he would find the problem i always wanted to meet deaf and blind adults and watch them perform on their jobs it‚Äôs inspiring
blind deaf but not mute i am the wrong person to be looking at this bring on more pictures of cats
this is so sad can‚Äôt imagine how hard life would be for the parents
thank you i was nervous because they were dirty lol but the sun helps hide it üòò
congratulations on the engagement i m proposing to my girlfriend soon so excited
my lawd you already have gold silver and platinum good on you and good luck best of wishes for your future
yeah i had no idea that was coming i am just so excited i had to post thank you
nope just laid there chewing on a bush ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èunphased
oh i ve seen this movie hope it goes better for you than the cast in backcountry
not gonna lie i looked for the black bear for too long also congrats
sadly she was eaten by the black bear after this post and the bear is now pretending to be op you can t fool us mr bear
gorgeous view ring and fingernails included is that a slight pink nailpolish or just clear over the top either way i envy your long fingers and nails congrats lt
that is a gorgeous ring suits you well too not every lady can pull off a large rock congratulations
i would to imagine that in alaska black bears can be licensed to officiate weddings
beautiful ring is it an antique perhaps inherited from your fiance s grandmother or equivalent do tiny peckers run in the family did she have it to help stimulate his grandfather is it a cockring is what i m asking seems sharp if so you should probably rethink that amp x b where s that bear
yeah well we go engaged at home with a mcdonalds sucks to be you
that is a nice ring it looks huge like carats congrats
she did it twice because mums always have to say don t make me tell you again lt
this is wholesome and i like it but seriously who doesn t understand the basic mechanics of folding a burrito
she is a fantastic mother and now i really want a burrito
can i be her son my mom would‚Äôve said ‚Äú go figure it out i‚Äôm busy ‚Äú
i miss my mom moms are the best for us the lucky ones
she looks so happy thet she is still needed by her children ‚ù§Ô∏è
your mom is precious thank you for sharing her with us
and you know she ate that plain rice burrito too because no good mom wasted food
mom making the video thinking ‚Äúhow the fuck does my child not know how to do this where did i go wrong‚Äù
i think the funniest part of this are the eyes lmao
i regret selecting yes when that birth survey asked if i wanted eyes
nonsense the sperm and egg won‚Äôt make a bear dog dog bear
this is the cutest this makes up for the trainwreck of a movie i saw this evening thank you
that‚Äôs a funny looking dog fox you have there buddy
i used to work at an animal sanctuary with a coyote and i would play with her all the time i realized why coyotes make bad pets though when she kept trying to playfully bite my neck
why in the hell do you have a coyote in your living room
don t be fooled by the cuteness and the playing thats still one of the best stalking animals in the us just look at the way he he he just presents his lil belly oh my god whos a good boi
i love things like this but not because of the cuteness but because the laws of the wild don t always apply you never know how one animal will be dominant over another regardless of size dominant might be a strong word but
what i‚Äôm most surprised about here is that a cat is actually appearing to be having a good time
looks far better than the new sonic no questions asked
my heart beat went fast after seeing this spiky potato üòä
im gonna wear a sonic costume when the movie premieres
aww he looks like a nervous preteen about to ask his crush out
frogs get posted in this sub every day but thanks for another awwww
frogs are disgusting slime monsters worth only xp per kill
i find the abundance of titles like this disappointing
anyone else had enough of this the amount of x here is sad bullshit yet because i sure as hell have
‚Äúi find the lack of insert animal here on this sub disappointing‚Äù every single day
he‚Äôs like ‚Äútell ya what let‚Äôs discuss this after my nap i‚Äôm stuffed ‚Äù
that s the type of pride you feel when you bring home a girl that you re stupidly in love with and you re mom isn t you just have that smile
this is cute but on a serious note try not to let your good bois eat whole chickens chicken bones can splinter and cause internal injuries
where are those ‚Äúthug life‚Äù sunglasses this is a very vanilla version of that üòé
oh cool i get to be that guy for once you know that look of fear and dread in humans well dogs have that too the muscles under their eyes tense up and pulls their lips back forming what resembles a smile that dog isn t thinking yeah i eat your chicken so what he is thinking omg i m busted now they re going to kill me
this makes me nervous chicken bones are bad for a dog they splinter it will mess up your dog s insides you should bring him to the vet
that looks like the face i make when i ve eaten too much and have to use the bathroom in a big way
ugh this again it‚Äôs not cute or funny to let your dogs eat cooked chicken bones
typical lab response did you do this did you eat the chicken ya you good cook
theresa may after getting back into downing street today
ham it s a helluva drug poor kitty will always be searching for the cured
jesus fuck people it s food are you trying to turn your pet into an aggressive monster
videos depicting scaring or teasing any animals should not be encouraged as funny or entertaining and should flagged as abusive behavior towards animals
ignore the ham and go right for the belly chance that she ll either surrender to the petting or obliterate your hand
this is like every human child falling asleep anywhere
i think the assembly instructions were unclear for this one
"what a drama queen
look at me i have no bed i am dead"
i have a husky rescue and my god the personality and dopey ness
i had a husky over at my house he would randomly disappear in the woods he required privacy to poop and he pooped a lot
i know how to sit on a fence hell i can even sleep on a fence the trick is to do it face down with the post in your mouth dwight schrute
the dog version of falling asleep mouth open against the window of your bus
your dog may be defective have you tried resetting it to factory defaults
can confirm my best friend is a husky and she is the biggest goofball there is and i love her
this makes me want a husky i guess i need to move to a cooler climate all my life plans are changing thanks op
if i fell asleep like this i wouldn t be able to move my neck for a week
glad to know it‚Äôs not just my huskies that do this i thought he was just special now i can blame it on a husky trait
yes they‚Äôre very different from malamutes which this is
this is what people look like when they stay until the night club closes
huskies are crazy dogs don t get one unless you lots of time energy and a big back yard they tear up your house and will try and jump fences and run away don t get one because you saw something on game of thrones
huskies and pugs are just those weird ones in the corner lol they re also adorable
he‚Äôs probably extremely hot dogs don‚Äôt sweat they cool down by panting he‚Äôs probably cooking his tongue on the steel try giving him some cold water or ice
we have a husky mix so far we haven t seen this behavior yet
i don‚Äôt get how huskies are so dopey they look like wolves haha
i can verify that statement mine will stand out in the rain and then whine because she is getting wet
mine likes to play dead when it‚Äôs nice out and i need her to come inside and then screams bloody murder when i pick her up to carry her in against her will so derpy omg
every time i see a ‚Äúhusky‚Äù posted here it‚Äôs a malamute lol and nobody corrects them
can someone please turn this into a gif with doggo rebooting etc
huskies are the best they re not a dog they have a special connection that takes them out of the normal dog thing people don t understand them but they re care givers not takers you have to accept them as one of your own they re special they know what love is expect it amp give it in bounds
i have a german shepherd husky mix she looks like a german shepherd but behaves like a husky she s awesome hyper as all fuck too would recommend
kickass cosplay plus that silver sable next to him is awesome too
maybe it‚Äôs the stance but i feel like this guy used to be an elvis impersonator
funny story i‚Äôve actually met this guy he came into my work a few months ago i asked him if anyone ever tells him he looks like rdj and he said almost daily he then went on to tell me about his side career as an impersonator really nice dude
ok comics people i have to know has this ever actually happened in the books if we have krypto the superdog and spider ham then it must have right
honestly though a dog in that iron man armor would be bad ass i want to see the scene where everyone has been joking about the dog and saying how cute it is the whole movie but then some baddies show up and the invincible super speed dog just tears through them like tissue paper
the amount of heartbreak this good boy would endure in endgame just hit me
i see some people saying it looks like ed norton but all i see is nick cage cosplaying as tony
looks like keanu reeves doing a good ironman cosplay
looks like nicholas cage playing a dude disguised as a other dude
the worst thing about avengers in not one of them has a dog like wtf
is it just me or does he look like like a cross between rdj and nicolas cage
i don t know if you can tell but i have like patterned my whole look after you
iron puppet could also defeat thanos and i know that for a fact
that‚Äôs a cool silver sable costume in the background
this looks like ed norton playing nicholas cage playing tony stark
i love this we‚Äôve been thinking about getting a buddy for our two year old lab mix this makes me think it would definitely be a good choice
growing old together we re as lucky as can be the storms that we have weathered it was always you n me you re my big ol goof but stay forever by my side there s snow upon our roof but still our hearts are warm inside ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
you can see the love multiply times in the after photo
this bottom picture reminds me of my wife and myself she s always smiling i m always frowning
i have two black lab sisters that are now they look exactly like these two
can some pet owner tell me if there s any research to demonstrate that dogs or even cats benefit from living with a member of the same species
i love them so much i hope my cats stay close forever like this ü•∞
oh my heart what a lovely photo that you will cherish forever sweet little things
the one on the left looks like they got onery af in their old age and i love it
hey jasper yeah max remember the time i ate the human s shoe yeah yeah that was a good shoe yeah

two black labs pups at once rip all shoes in the house in their first two years
i had chocolate lab sisters they were the best pups ever they both passed earlier this year my one lola developed a tumor and had to be put down her sister lucy died about a month later i am convinced it was from a broken heart she spent every day all day for the last years with her sister and after she died it was too much for her to take i hope they are chasing each other around doggy heaven
photos like these are why i love this subreddit you can t have a bad day after seeing photos like these your doggos are the best
goofy bro remember when i pooped in the human‚Äôs shoe stoic eh goofy remember when i pooped in the human‚Äôs shoe stoic the red ones hehehehe cough hehehe that was a good poop goofy yeah a good poop hehehehe farts stoic goofy hehehehe cough fart poop
puppies are cute but it s the dogs who are so old they go grey around the face that really make my heart melt lt
and then they ll die rip don t post the picture you take after one of them dies but one of them is still alive because that will be very sad
such good boys ‚ù§Ô∏è i have a year old chocolate lab and his best friend besides me is our month old rescue pup they‚Äôre always toy thick as thieves
my weiner dog is now all grey but she still acts like a puppy sometimes the after photo reminds me of her i guess sometimes dogs are hust happy to have lived life
just adopted a black labrador cross to spend her life with our year old black lab this made me teary
old doggy brothers old doggies they‚Äôre so old and sweet but also old with their awesome old man doggy beards
we deliberately got a spread of labs from litters across yrs our abb and jazz lived until and respectively last couple of years so were much cuddles and love thru our friends at big dog rescue we‚Äôve just rescued another pair of yr old yellows rejuvenating friends for our eldest choc now
this reminds me of past and present pics of old people couples
this dont remind anyone of the wayan bros ‚Äúlook up marlon say cheese ‚Äù
i lost my black lab on monday one of the most heartwrenching things i have ever done i ve felt a lot of asystolic heart beats but that was the worst one to see these two laid together smiling makes my heart warm
reminds of jerry and michael the two characters from the book michael brother of jerry written by jack london
love that my large mixed breed dog is over i figure these are bonus years i see my dogs eyes in your dog s eyes thank you for sharing
the look like they have lived such fulfilling and happy lives with lots of ‚Äúgood boy girl‚Äù pets treats and sunshine i want to feel like that when i hit my golden years
im guessing lefty is more rambunctious than righty by their expressions in both pictures
god i want a black lab so bad how are they for beginners who have never gotten a dog before
this makes my heart happy and sad at the same time my old girl is and i know she s not going to last too much longer
my lab pup just passed away a week ago today and oof this got me
ohh these guys look like my older lab that has been gone for almost years it‚Äôs crazy how much your heart hurts when you get reminded they are amazing
one could only wish something like this my parents have been together since and still are god i wonder what they did to get so lucky
the one on the right looks so much like my old boy we lost last year it made me smile to remember him unexpectedly thank you so much üòä
i love how you can tell in both pictures who the goofy dog is
cue ‚Äúi wanna grow old with you‚Äù from the wedding singer
thank you for bringing me some small semblance of joy as i sit in this shit smelling public restroom
looks just like my dog from when i was young that‚Äôs lovely thank you for sharing
i like how in both pictures you can tell who s the goofball and who s the long suffering stalwart
üéº i could be the dog who grows old with you i wanna grow old with you üéº
my blacklab also has the grey beard going i refuse to listen or think of how old she actually is and i say she is always or
these pictures remind me of two of my dogs who grew up as companions we adopted a second dog about months after getting our first so he would have company while we were at work and a playmate to help tire him out they became such good friends we called them our bookends because they used to sit and lie down in identical positions right next to each other all the time they aged together and once their difficult days began to outnumber their contented ones we had them put to sleep together we knew neither would have wanted to go on without the other
my great aunt and uncle had a dog named mitzie who was exactly like this she passed away last year
man that‚Äôs so sweet makes me think of my rhodesian ridgeback i had for years
my heart man my heart some gorgeous pups you have there
"awww too sweet
me and my hubby are growing fat together lol
they look so cuddly"
is it weird i want to put this on a canvas and hang it in my house
beautiful thanks for sharing lost one of my doggos recently and she looked just like one on the left both young and old
labradooooog woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof
that s the dang sweetest thing i ve seen all dang week
i feel really dumb i thought they were siamese twins attached at the head
it really bothers me that the dogs aren t in the same order s
labs are amazing dogs my buddy has a chocolate lab and a black lab big lumbering guys and they‚Äôre always together
so precious especially the one on the left‚Äôs cute face
we just lost our black lab a few weeks back this hurts wish my neighbour would stop cutting onions
just had to put down my oldest dog yesterday having done that it kind of scares me i have the same age because just losing her was one of the worst things i ve experienced
we don‚Äôt deserve animals luckily they will never know that
that is so sweet also how much time took place between those two pictures
man this makes me happy and sad what a couple of beauties
"this feels so bittersweet for me
my family picked up two black labs from the same litter one of them passed suddenly three years ago at but his brother is still here and as a family we still feel his absence"
if only we could have such pure souls i lost my best friend of years charlie a few months ago and i still talk to him when times get tough that dog taught me so many lessons about life
they look the way my hand feels when petting a dog on mushrooms like they‚Äôre just melting together
i have two black dogs like this and i was like this is adorable we should do this but then i realized i would never get both of them to lay down at the same time while taking a picture they re lab mix though wish they had more lab and less crazy in them
kudos op you reached into my feels with this post‚Äîan occurrence that rarely happens to me in the aww threads
it truly isn t fair how long they can t stay with us
hey i have a heart condition you can t do this kinda stuff all willy nilly
still lookin like they re ready to give a good chase i wish em many more woofs boops and treats lt
i like how their personalities are still written all over their face
anyone else a doofus and think they were conjoined can t just be me right
great picture looking at something like this you don‚Äôt know who is the luckiest one the dog parent or the dogs we need each other
i think the one on the right is blind in the second picture üò™
aw this reminds me of my favorite dog in the whole wide world üò¢
i had the same dogs lost one but still have my girl
i wish i could build this kind of connection with someone
they remind me of my first two dogs that have since past away two black labs one of which i had from the day i was born and one which came out of our litter when i was i miss them so fucking much
they actually grow grey hair looking all dignified and full of wisdom to young pup let me tell you kid during my days there were squirells everywhere
the one on the right reminds me of my girl ferris she was the best
this makes me really happy and really sad at the same time i wish dogs could live forever
this might be one of the best pictures i ve ever seen
it is small reminders like this that make me take life so very carefully time is the only thing we really have that is real love harder always
how did he even get in there the fountain seems really tall but he‚Äôs cute none the less
i like how he tried to rest his head on his paws and he was like ‚Äúoh yeah can‚Äôt breathe under there ‚Äù
my black lab died in november and i ve been having dreams every night about him but i haven t been crying much since it happened seeing these mannerisms though really triggered something and reminded me of my goofy boy and i can t stop crying c
my dog routinely tries to jump in fountains in our neighborhood yesterday she succeeded and had herself a little swim looks like she‚Äôs not the only one
this is true my lab retriever mix always and i mean always finds a way to get under our shed no matter what we use to close it off that and running away we call her the black stallion all you see is a black shadow running and you won‚Äôt see her again until she decides to come back home which she always does thank goodness
its mesmerizing must obey yes master i will knock things off shelves
editing idea slow zoom in on the face with dramatic choir belting in latin
wtf are you seeing this i ve got to lay off the nip bro
i want to go to a dog birthday party once before i die ‚ù§Ô∏è
doggy daycare needs a movie the hook being like daddy day care with alot more bitches
doggie daycare worker is my dream job not even like a head trainer or anyone in charge just a peon worker i can t imagine a better gig if only i could afford to live on like hr that those folks likely make i d do it for life
one morning i dropped my dog off at doggy day care amp i got a call from them an hour or so later i was so worried something had happened to her the person calling said ‚Äúwinnie‚Äôs friend toby is having a birthday party today is it ok if winnie attends she will get a dog friendly cupcake and ice cream ‚Äù yes that is definitely ok
omg look how happy he is to be the birthday boy best job ever i envy you
am i a bad person for thinking it would be kinda awesome if i went to work on monday and all the children at my human daycare had turned into dogs
much faster than her big brother awp but just as effective
this is so cute we‚Äôre getting a puppy soon and we‚Äôre considering the name scout too because my family loves to kill a mockingbird
i almost thought there was another dog in the bag then i realized that the other dog is the bag
i am scout look at me i am heading home with my new family üòä
so cute we‚Äôre getting a puppy soon and i can‚Äôt wait
my friend sarah has a year old dog that looks just like this also named scout she‚Äôs a good girl as well
i want a golden retriever so fucking badly and how dare you show me this picture of this beautiful dog that i want so badly it‚Äôs so rude of you how dare you my emotions are everywhere please love her and keep her happy omg she‚Äôs so cute you are so lucky omg
how precious i named my first golden scout she was the sweetest gal who i miss every dang day enjoy your new puppy adventure
ooh can we call it a pupper or a doggo or something i hope so
my folks just named their cavalier king charles ‚Äúscout‚Äù many pets and belly rubs to scout
instead of barking do they go boink and bonk because that would be sicc
my dog is a scout only months and already about times bigger then your scout though they don t stay puppies long
possible new face of bad advice dog i would follow that face
aw that is a super happy pupper they will put this picture into the vault in paris where they kept the old kilogram to define the happy pupper ‚ù§Ô∏è
these two just gave me aww freeze similar to brain freeze but less painful so cheesy i know but it s early
no wonder they re asleep all that co just going into the other on and on
damn who sleeps like that anyone even foot away from me while sleeping is taking too much of my air i can t breath lol
i like this sub but i sometimes think y all are sedating these creatures
if i‚Äôm not wrong i think it‚Äôs amelie and canele riepoyonn on instagram
my littermates sleep exactly like this although more often they‚Äôre spooning
oh lord this is too much can‚Äôt even tell you how much i love this
yo stop drugging your cats and doing this shit üõë ‚úãüèΩ
super cute now but i‚Äôd bet money they are both assholes when they are awake
if that was in black and white i d almost be convinced it s a mirrored image
i used to this with my twin brother when i was a newborn my parents tried to split us apart and no matter what we ended up head to head
let s put our noses together to figure out how to get these bowties off without hurting mom s feelings
i‚Äôm sure the noodles will help fill you up if the dog is too small to satiate your appetite
you think i m too small karen i dare you to put that bowl on the floor karen
what breed puppy is this its so cute it looks like a teddy bear
please make this precious little angel their own smol bowl and post another picture
this is an adorable puppy the tiny paws and sweet little face are precious
if i werr you i would give him the whole bowl and bring him a couple of prestige karat edible gold chocolate flavored chew toy
was he trying to get a better look at his former brother
they re right you need them to get bigger to make enough stock for ramen
no he is not he deserves everything he wants thou shalt feed thine puppy for he is a gift from god to represent everything still good in the world
seems i m the only person whose reaction was mmm that ramen looks nice
that thing better not have onions or garlic if you intend to give it to him
omg it looks like my baby i have a pointer mix with this type of pattern on her face i swear they could be twins such a cute pupper
what kind of dog is this and does it have an instagram
why is nobody answering what breed this good boi is i need to know or i will be forced to steal pupper sorry not sorry
that look right there is one to cure a bad day so adorable
this pocket sized doggo looks like the plush doggo you can win in those claw machines what a beauty
what is wrong with me that i got turned on by you calling your dog baby
i understand i want to bathe in that noodle soup too
your dog is literally the most perfect most adorable dog i have ever seen
‚Äúwell you aren‚Äôt cute like me so hand it over ‚Äù pup
omg that puppy cant be real which appears to be a common thing in this thread but holy crap it s cute as all hell
i gasped this is the cutest little being in the whole universe omgggg
bring it back bring it back don t take it away from me
i hope these two never get split up wow this hurt me for some reason
cat at the en if the gif ‚Äúnow i gotta clean all the human stink off him‚Äù
i m very emotional watching this i hope the mama and baby are never separated
‚Äúi just spent an hour cleaning that get your dirty mitts off of him ‚Äù
this makes me wanna pet my dog even though i‚Äôm at school
why would you keep doing that if you see the mom freak out
hey guys look what happens when i take this kitten away from their mother omg she gets distressed woaah
honestly you are stressing poor momma out that s not cute
well you re obviously holding it wrong and it looks uncomfortable
sire its nice but in months the mother will act as if the child is just some other cat
bring him back so i can savagely and sweetly attack
that s the type of moon that would bribe her kid into college
doesn t always happen my barn cat caught mice and gave to her adult daughter when daughter had kittens grandma would feed them too
bigger cat s body slam fails to do damage due to ample pillows
i m binging disney music and this with the up theme shit i m a grown ass man with taxes and shit and this made me cry today was a slammer of a day at work and i started the day depressed this broke me
you‚Äôre asian i know what you love ‚ù§Ô∏è no give him back
what you‚Äôre going to see shane dawson fucking hell give my baby back to me
guys that s not a hug even the ears going back indicate the mother is being playful and attacking the kitten like it would a toy she is not distressed or upset she is being playful
no its not its a fish as described in the post op was not clear at all with his description
i just realized i‚Äôve never really seen an alpaca move
i find it a bit disturbing that alpaca has such a fine ass
its gallop is so smooth it almost looks unrealistic
she needs some rock to goat around beautiful altiplano fluff
is it yours can i come play with it alpaca my bags right now
i don t want to know what happens when he gets caught don t tell me how it ends
that alpaca just wishes his neck was a long as that kids is
correct me if i‚Äôm wrong but i think that‚Äôs just a balloon animal
they just move so bouncy it looks effortless and i‚Äôm kind of jealous
alcapa anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery isn t something you play with you go to a hospital and see a cardiologist about it alpacas on the other hand are fun to play with
that s every horror film ever out of breath victim is running for their life while the murderer keeps up with them by slowly walking behind them
lmao i‚Äôm sorry but i kept wondering how funny it would be if the alpaca fellüíÄ
the one survivor says we‚Äôre lucky that we‚Äôve never seen the ending of this makes me wonder
i‚Äôve never seen it in the moment like that i could watch them for hours
i am the dog with job to do am grab the bat when you are thru the batter take the final swing n then is time to do my thing i race out to the plate so proud am trying to impress the crowd but realize an error earn so back to dugout i return
she does her job just fine it s her handler that is still learning
no he out the bat in the ground at that point it was hers no take backs
i love the final grab while he s holding it ike maybe this time i ll get it
give me the bat marge gimme the bat come on gimme the bat gimme the bat scaredy cat
why‚Äôd he put the bat on the ground all i see is a good girl
dog dig nothing wrong batter thought it was ball and dropped the bat
lately i keep getting this error with that site anyone has any idea why i want to see lovely bell noooo amp x b error the request could not be satisfied request blocked generated by cloudfront cloudfront
hey half of any job is attitude this dog s got the stuff you can t teach the rest is easy
i‚Äôve never seen that breed before are ‚Äúbat retrievers‚Äù more rare than their golden counterparts
at least pet the dog if you re not giving her the bat god damn it üò≠
that was the dog s way of being super sarcastic about a stike call she thought the umpire missed
c mon man just lemme do my job already i got places to go
just pet the damn dog already can t you see she wants it
considering that minor leaguers often have to pay for their own bats i would be kind of pissed at this arrangement if i m paying a couple hundred dollars for this bat the last thing i want is a dog coming by and grabbing it with their teeth by the way most minor leaguers at the lower levels earn about k a year
i gets you drop i gets i have huffs you drop i not gets he keeps what it drops i gets come back huffs mmmm me gets one more time still no gets huffs i go back next time i gets i m a good girl
the last game i saw there she did something similar then bent down to take a shit behind home plate
bat hits ground go get and bring back no you can t use that bat it hit the ground hahahaha so cute
are we sure she wasn t just next in the batting order
why does the announcer say lulu what is this dogs name op
this is why i can t take my dog disc golfing anymore my fault once she learned she loved catching and retreiving discs she is so eager any disc flying on the course is hers to go get and bring back stay doesn t work with her when her new passion in life is involved fetch is life
the dog went on strike after this she was overheard in the dugout claiming she can‚Äôt work with amateurs
zomg stop playing baseball give the bat to the dog you heartless man
clearly that dog needs the bat i think he should give it to her
this guys obviously not a dog person or he would‚Äôve given the dog the freaking bat lol
na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na batdog
she did not go out at the wrong time the batter signaled setting his bat down her at the wrong time he should have let her take it and then followed her to the dugout and picked it back up
she went out at the right time he set the bat down she is perfect and can do no wrong he needs to be more cautious about the signals he gives off
it touched the ground that‚Äôs my entire job gimme the stick
is going to be so awesome seeing america be a poor nation in years
she must think the bat is broken because he‚Äôs not swinging at strikes down the middle
i d just give her the bat and take the out can t be helped
the camera angle when he bends over and the catcher tossed the ball has austin powers written all over it
are bat retrieving dogs the norm ive never seen one and now i feel as if my life has been missing a vital component
i have a feeling someone sends her so it wasn‚Äôt her fault but the handlers fault
well if he didn‚Äôt want her to take the bat he shouldn‚Äôt have dropped it on the ground
sooooooo cute amp x b and anyway you gotta learn somehow right ü•≥ü•≥üòÉüòÉ
hey give me the bat i m just trying to do my job man what s this guy s problem don t turn your back on me gimmie the bat asshole what not yet i ll be back fucker
is this at the w s dash stadium i know they have a bat retriever at the myrtle beach pelicans but this clearly isn t that stadium i wasn t aware that other teams had this going on
love how she comes back like are you sure nope okay byeeee
this is finn the las vegas teams bat dog and she has an instagram that‚Äôs worth checking out
damn bro don‚Äôt put the bat down during your at bat the dog did what she was supposed to do
pa announcer now at the plate jon snow amp x b sorry ghost now pats for you this at bat
you win for now human but i shall have what is mine
wow mlb trying to figure out how to put butts in seats and the answer is right here
that is not bell that is lou lou gerig of the greensboro grasshoppers
such a good boy but this makes me wonder if dogs feel embarrassment i sure hope not
‚Äúhey homan i am here to take your bat no yes guess it‚Äôs a no ‚Äù guy looks away dog tries to grab the bat guy looks at dog ‚Äúso that‚Äôs a no for sure ‚Äù dog walks away
they cut out the cutest part where she comes back and tries to gently take it from him
her name is lou lou where the fuck did you get bell from
when i was a kid a local baseball stadium had a golden retriever named jake the diamond dog i was only about five years old at most when i met him so i can t fully remember his job but i believe it was his job to retrieve baseballs maybe he got the bats he had in my memory a nice little tent he sat under and my sister and i went under it with him and his handler we pet him and got these neon orange hats with his name on them and his handler signed them for us i m nearly nineteen now and my sister will be in december i m pretty sure she threw her hat out long ago but i gave mine to my brother who is nearly and he wears it often i love baseball dogs
of course he couldn t just let her have it and get it back later cause that would require humanity be present in him
i must be as dumb as the dog because the drop of the bat tying of the shoes and the hard umpire strike signal had be thinking strike out too
i am on mobile and the preview took forever to load i went into this expecting something entirely different
i d give her the bat and go retrieve it back just so she felt appreciated good girl
who puts their bat down in the middle of an at bat he gave off all the signs of someone who either got struck out or took a walk
i ve wondered why they don t use dogs to get the stray tennis balls at wimbledon instead of enslaved children
she s already learned you can see how well she is trained when human puts bat on ground she gets it it isn t her fault that either the ump made a bad call or the batter doesn t have a great eye for the strike zone
that is one of the most adorable ways to employ a dog so darn cute
drop that bat inside the batters box look like a moron don t pet the good doggo for trying i hope they lost
in here defense he did put the bat on the ground she knew her cue and nailed it
but you have a bat i take bats clearly i m in the right place at the right time
my girl bell got the spirit she a little confused but she got the spirit
for context this is the greensboro grasshoppers in greensboro nc
the pitcher threateningly holds the ball as if going to throw give the dog the bat
that s a good way to fuck fuck with a batter though when the count is send a dog out to mess with his focus
i seen an umpire get mad at that dog and throw the bat away from it bell still got it though
i would‚Äôve given her the bat anyway because i‚Äôd feel bad
i actually had a dog she had black lab and some sort of collie in her we think who absolutely loved heading down to the local diamonds when the boys and girls underhand fastball games were being played i don t know how she figured it out but she could tell when the ball was foul and she would take off to retrieve it and bring it back to the pitcher she never went for fair balls only foul balls it was really something
no she absolutely knew no way in hell shes gonna let homeboy stand in there and take a seam right down the middle good girl
dog is trained when they see a bat get dropped to go and pick it up this guy drops the bat to tie his shoe so the dog was just doing his job like a good boye
outsourcing automation and now this how can we expect to compete
he s the one who put the bat on the ground good girl
really you re gonna name the dog bell with an umpire yelling ball every seconds thats not confusing or anything
she s trained to go when the bat is put down so really the trainers just didn t think ahead and she is doing a perfect job
she also realized it was clearly a ball and was just assuming the umpire could make the correct call
greensboro grasshoppers i miss babe i watched that dog for years
to be fair the bad boy here is the batter who didn t wait for ump to make his call lol
batter should have just dropped it and gotten a new bat
literally and actually laughed out loud at that one
‚Äústick stick stick stick gimme the stick i‚Äôm ready for stick ‚Äù
she s sooo cutttteeeee‚ò∫Ô∏è why won t he give it to her üò§
ahem you mean she went out at the right time the batter put the bat down at the wrong time bell is a good dog
we need this at reds games a break from losing would be fun to watch
omg i had noo idea there was such a thing as a bat retrieving puppy üòÇüòÇüòÇ best thing ever
not really the dog is trained to pick up bats that have been dropped to the floor so when it hit the floor that was the signal for him her to do their thing
a chinese joke is just begging to be made but i won t do this to yu
yeah it‚Äôs cute but please don‚Äôt really take a flier on cooking it
awe what a sweet doggo but damm that s a big cooking pot
i think you are making the delicate dish of puperoni with steamed veggies it does offer a bite of bite
dude i m fine with cooking em alive but at lewse take the hair off
take the carrots out of the box because no one likes the taste of plastic mixed with carrots
i was scrolling saw this and let out a quiet ‚Äúnoooooooo‚Äù
oh by the way the reason people are asking if you are chinese is because its a joke where chinese people cook foods with like dogs and cats and stuff you might wanna think before you post all i am saying its a pic of a dog in a bowl with vegetables with the caption cutest dinner ever
judges on chopped ‚Äúthe good boi is a little gamey but brings an umami flavor to the dish as long as it‚Äôs cooked right‚Äù
and then you realize this probably means months of training to make spectators laugh
what the heck dudes just tryna sleep in the sea lion exhibit leave him alone is this what this country has come to where a man can t even take a nap in an aquarium without being harassed by the sea life smh
wow reposted again tired of seeing this guy‚Äôs crap facial hair
they will learn to teabag people and we all wil be sorry
reminds me of the oppression society presses on gamers
you reposted it just a few hours after it hit the front page but you took out the best part which was the sound you suck big time
euron was clearly tired after that fight with jamie
anyone know how trained this seal is cause that just looks like normal communication lol
euron greyjoy ironborn king of the salt and sea lion
with that look this corgi is having none of your shenanigans
fun fact corgisharks can smell food on a hardwood floor from up to a mile away
nooo it‚Äôs going to be stuck in my head all day for the th time
i don t know this little pupper doesn t look too happy about being a shark maybe that s just a ploy to catch the humans off guard though
an italian name for sharks is pescecane which means dogfish
i have been trying and failing to find one of these for my cat where did you get the fin
a rare picture leman russ hunting down daemons in the warp
no i despise this child s cringy song just please nnnnoooooooooo
i only get this reference because of celine s carpool karaoke
i don‚Äôt usually feel good but when i do it‚Äôs because of something like that
what about my dude that gets left hanging at the end
makes me think of a movie from the s called the mighty
what a sweet boy being a kid is tough sometimes it makes my heart happy that kids like them exist
do you ever watch something that wants to make you die less this was it i m saving this i know gold when i see it
ohhh there s this wet stuff on my face it came from my eyes and my nose is all ready to run off the best kind of allergies
whoa whoa careful with those double guns at the end there my pew pew sound effect was not prepared for that amount of awesome
let‚Äôs not encourage weakness there‚Äôs natural selection for a reason
i ve coached basketball theast few years but the second year i coach was one of the most rewarding experiences one of my personal goals was for every player to score at least once the last game and i had one kid who hasn t scored they were the youngest and smallest player but so one that really worked hard in practice and tried their best she came close a few times and you could really see the disappointed but that last game and seeing that basket was awesome most of the parents knew she was the only one and everyone was super excited for it the smile on her face was huge very rewarding as a coach to see and help her develop a love of sport and teamwork
i wish i could be as happy as that kid if only for a few seconds
he abandoned his defensive responsibilities pretty quickly
yeah right just wants the assist to help him hit that triple double for real though kudos to he just made that kids entire basketball career that much better and fulfilling
first he s camped out in the lane next he travles and finally he s showboating needs to get back and play some defense s this is awesome good on everyone in this video
i saw this months ago it made my eyes water i watched it again same lt
brings tears to my eyes so sweet to see such kindness in a world with too much hate
number is the kid i would always trip during sports
so pure as a guy who only grew to be that kid s reaction is exactly how i felt on the rare occasion i was able to score on my giant ass friend during neighborhood pickup games he grew to be
wish there was more of this in the world we live in today those kids are just great for doing this we all need to feel like we belong and are part of the team sometimes
but tbh none of them should be playing this game kids never gonna make it and wasting his time
i love how the other team‚Äôs player was the first to offer him a high five gd my heart is full
there was definitely some travelling in there and the ref should have blown the wistly learn to play the game right you little shit
i hope that kind boy s parents are proud he s pretty cool
the big kids the real mvp he gets the assist and gets right back on defense
all i see are great gentlemen in making parenting done right üëç
i m taking her this morning to check for a chip i ve posted her on lost pages as welk she was left on the window sill of a concession stand at the park and couldn t get down on her own she s so sweet she hasn t barked once and she listens very well she s a special girl
who would dump this perfectly good human well done doggo take care of her
take those posters down and give that dog a snuggle if monsters like her previous owners can do that to such a sweet dog they don‚Äôt deserve a dog at all that‚Äôs your dog now congratulations üéâüçæ
oh please please pleeeease keep her she already had her trust broken once then came to you cause she likes you and think your a good person prove her right
yeah women will occasionally do that but usually only if you have a nice conversation and really hit it off i like your dog
you two look so good together i think perfect match
keep her pleeeeeaaseee keep us posted on the situation
the best pets are the ones that choose you i hope you are able to show her the love and attention she needs she would make a great assistant i bet good on you for doing the right thing and taking her to the vets have you named her yet
you know when everyone assumes that everyone on reddit is a dude here‚Äôs an example that some are actually pups
she is hot i cant believe she just followed you around and got in your car does she have a boyfriend your dog is cute too
i wonder if she picked her last owner too and owner was not happy about it
damn never met a photographer dog with their own car that s pretty cool
i must have missed the report of happy sandstorms today sniff i hope it all works out well whatever the outcome but those eyes say please don t let me go again i found you and want to keep you
i would ve done the same but you know jail and stuff
you were chosen out of hundreds if not thousands of people
yeah looks in too good of shape to be a stray if she s not chipped i hope you keep her doesn t look like you have much of a choice
i had a kitten show up at my door just before a huge snowstorm on christmas eve a few years ago she very patiently informed us that she lived with us now so yeah she does
i too would love if a pretty girl jumped in my car too bad it never happened before
she s cute why would anyone dump her like that is beyond me also how do you hold a camera with your paws
this is how i got my dog it wasn t the best time for a dog for me but it was one of the best things to ever happen i m so glad i kept her she s my ride or die ‚ù§ you two look great together
you re a good person for checking for a chip before keeping her someone out there still has my pup and never bothered looking for a chip we even called every shelter and pound in the area to let us know if any dogs similar to her came in and no call yet its been almost months i want my baby back
lucky good friends are hard to find and this one found you
at first i thought the dog was talking about the lady i just woke up
i imagined this as the dog posting this and it was a lot more fun
you have just renewed your hero license for the next days may your next traffic lights be green
y all both beautiful lt puppers are god s gift to humanity
why don t guys do this i ve noticed this trend where guys will take a picture of their dog but any picture that s a selfie with an animal seems to be a girl almost like they have to be seen in the picture i ll be accused of noticing a pattern that doesn t exist but it s definitely a difference between men and women posting pictures online
i can‚Äôt believe the woman was so rude to get into the dogs car without permission
are you absolutely certain it wasn t an off leash park and you didn t just steal someone s dog
such a sweet dog unreal that someone would leave her like that glad she found you üòä
the pupper has chosen you congratulations on your new friend üòä
smh but when i do this to women they call the cops and tell me to leave them alone
getting a pet is a big decision and people should make a lifelong commitment when they do get one i d love that sweet pup and give her a good life hard to imagine just abandoning her
wow looks and sounds like she picked you if you end up keeping her you re a very lucky soul she looks like a sweet girl
i hope you end up together just a feeling best wishes to you both
how did your dog react to this random pretty girl who jumped in the car
the great thing about situations like this is that as time goes on you really begin to wonder who rescued who
so sweet i think you have been spoken for you re all hers
i would keep her after getting her checked out she does not have a tag so i would keep her
anybody else think the post was about the girl in the thumb initially
mind don t do it me i have to mind you ll get downvoted me a small price to pay for salvation your thighs are thiiiiiiiicccc
you belong to her now if you can t take care of her let me know i ll take her if you re close
seems like she s already getting along with your dog too
you should always check strays for diseases you never know where that woman‚Äôs been
kind of bold that she just hopped up in your lap like she was ready to drive then just grabbed your phone and snapped a pic humans aren t too hard to take care of good on you for the rescue
that black mouthed cur looks like she found a good human
that look on your face when you realize the dog just adopted you you have a little oh shit moment and then realize you already fell in love with her and you re ok with it all and about to embark on some grand adventure together maybe chronicle your adventures if you are a photojournalist this is a great cover photo for your future book
ok so i really don‚Äôt mean for this to come out creepy but if i were the dog i would have chosen her too
if she was just abandoned this is why i hate people
i ll take her home she is alot prettier than my current girlfriend
wow what a wonderful story do you always drive around looking for humans
the way she‚Äôs looking at you is so touching can‚Äôt put that emotion into words what a sweet girl
it‚Äôs weird when two people i‚Äôve known from greensboro make the front page in the same week as well as the bat dog from the grasshoppers
this post would be very concerning if there were no dog in the photo
i would take home too if she followed me around the dog is nice looking too lol
seems like a nice girl hope the dog will be able to take care of her
the last time a girl hopped in my car at the park it triggered an amber alert
i m assuming you mean the dog right ü§£ you re a kind human hope she finds her owner
that must be a pretty progressive place to have a dog on a photo assignment and allowing them to drive that girl looks like a keeper nice one doggo
honestly i thought op was the girl that got dumped because of the thumbnail until o got to the end of the title and thought about it glad everyone came out ok
i can‚Äôt tell if it was the girl or the dog who captioned this
they say fir every pretty woman there s a man who is sick of her
it s a message from god for you to become her guardian
if you need help the humane society in greensboro there will be able to offer advice and even some level of help they are on west wendover ave west of downtown but the drive would be worth it
guessing you are getting a d oggie for the assignment lol
for some reason when i first read the title i thought it was about op and not the dog lol
what‚Äôs amazing about this is how the heck does that dog know how to type
tempting as it is to join in on the flirty replies my animal control reflex is to ask if you took the dog to get scanned for a microchip by a vet you never know the dog could have been stolen or lost we ve had dogs and cats returned to their owners that had been gone for years amp x b best of luck to you you ve done a good thing by taking her in either way
when i read the title i thought someone ditched the girl and not the dog lol
i didn t even k ow dogs could drive but it makes sense that they could lure girls into their cars
which dog school gives photo asignments sounds very prestigious
who would dump such a nice looking girl btw what s with the dog
congratulation to becoming a mom and she s such a beauty
she s desperate and she trusts you i m not you so do what you want with that trust but if she hopped in my car then i would have kept her forever
i ve always wanted to find a and help an animal in distress but at the same time i dont because no animal should need to feel like that
it s a shame when people throw away a perfectly good white girl like that
sounds like you just got a dog possession is th s of the law
she looks really healthy and is obviously trained no collar though i imagine someone felt they had to let her go as opposed to wanted to probably spent a fortune getting her highlights and eyebrows done take good care of her
they say that dogs find their owners not the other way around
i didn‚Äôt know dogs could type much less drive or take pictures üòÑ seriously she looks like a sweet dog
this happened to me when i was a little kid out with family at the mall in another state it was raining and we were all bundling into the station wagon someone opened the backdoor and this great big shaggy dog just jumped in the adults pulled him out and of course we left him there amp x b over a quarter of a century later this memory still brings tears to my eyes i m haunted amp x b so thank you for not kicking her out of the car and for making sure she ll know love again lt amp x b and to that dog we left behind i m really so so sorry
hey dog you are obviously new to the laws around here but you can t drive with a human in your lap that s just not safe
so kind of you to pick her up but what s she doing in your driver s seat
that‚Äôs so sad whyyyy thank you for being a responsible young lady
someone just dumped a dog in the part who the fuck would do that
pretty girls should stick together i hope you can keep her
that‚Äôs too sad she‚Äôs cute the dog is pretty cool too
that looks so much like my dog you had me checking my photos
when i first saw this i thought the dog was talking about you
what a good pupper for getting your license take care of that hooman
no sad content downvoted and reported next time follow the rules
a dog with a photography hobby that also rescued a sweet girl that just got dumped now i ve seen everything
i read the title before the photo had had a chance to load up and was a bit concerned
people always throwing out a perfectly good white girl what‚Äôs up with that
you d think with a red top like that she d be recognized obviously well groomed with clean nails and long blonde hair hopefully a boyfriend comes along to claim her
weird story but ok what s with the dog next to her though he yours
who would dump that girl in the red glad the dog found her
heck of a way to get a girlfriend how d you get the dog
some people are just unfit for dogs good luck to you and your new daughter
it s so cool that a dog can be a photographer and own a car
i legit thought the title was about the human and not the dog for a second
there s a special level of hell that s reserved for people who abandon dogs
she‚Äôs pretty cute dig the freckles and red top i‚Äôd keep her
humans are all ways getting in to others people s cars
i m like sure i played softball right around there why couldn t any dogs jumped in my car
this picture is confusing captain marvel had a pet cat
took me a moment before i realized that you‚Äôre talking about the dog
if she starts to annoy you take her phone away until she starts to behave
you have been chosen better get your belly rubhin hand warmed up
if you don t find a owner pls keep her she clearly chose you üòçüòç
or the dog could have gotten out of its yard why assume someone dumped it
lol i was looking at this post for like mins thinking it was the girl who got dumped and then she got in the car then i looked in the comments
that‚Äôs cool and all but i‚Äôm more interested in the dog‚Äôs photography
i read this from the perspective of the dogs male owner who just got a new girlfriend
keep us updated i m very curious to know if she ends up with you or her owner either way she looks happy you re gorgeous bye the two marks under your right eye the color of them and your smileüòçüòç
that‚Äôs cool i knew dogs were awesome but i didn‚Äôt know they did photo assignments that‚Äôs awful cool of you letting that human woman in your car doggo s
does anyone know what kind of dog this might be or what kind of mix she s a really nice medium size and very pretty i d like to add her to my dogs i like but can t have list that i keep for such occasions
ha i laughed as i read this from the viewpoint of the dog
hoping you keep her she chose you as her protector if it is within your means and comfort to keep her please do so you will not regret it one bit i promise you that she also looks like you could call her joey
that dog has a look of please please let me come with you i hope you enjoy a long life together
so puppies can type nowadays why did you let her drive after she followed you
she looks healthy and strong beautiful coat kind eyes i think the dog should keep her
hate it when dumped girls get in my car üôÑ i feel you doggo
i d like to know why that girl sat on your lap and took a selfie humans smh
what a good dog to pick up this lost hooman and take her home
you let her take the picture of you and humans don‚Äôt normally have microchips
if she isnt chipped congratulations on your furbaby
not only this is so adorable to watch it‚Äôs also incredibly satisfying watching how precisely she cuts each strip of paper to a uniform shape size
this is a love bird i had one and it did the exact same thing they would do this to carry material to make a nest with
man love looking at lovebirds but i‚Äôve got some ptsd from the one i owned for a few months
aww the little request for the paper strip at the end üòç
out of curiosity is this a kind of mating instinct where birds try to impress others with their superior feathers or is this something else idk much about birds
deserve dinosaurs lost against a rock it s our time

need a little back story to this or something seems sweet but also could be the start of a criminal minds episode
this is adorable as hell i love when little kids wear glasses but i think that makes me an asshole
aww what a cutie pie with those glasses and that wide smile
wow you got her the big barbie gift guy was committed take my upvote
my niece bought that barbie boat a few weeks ago and she can t stop playing with it the smile on that girl s face love this picture
had a feeling this was going down an incel route here glad i was wrong nice looking void you ve got there
i love seeing my black cat in the sun they get so shiny
what am i looking at here this is not the cosmology reddit why you show pictures of a black hole
they must be taken good care of what a shiny coat what a pretty minipanther
i can literally feel the heat radiating of that shininess
holy shit it s charging up i don t know what it will do once charged but i sure as hell wouldn t want to be near it
what a cute li l void and such a shiny event horizon
my favorite part about black cats is how warm they get after being in the sun
have you ever been sitting on your sofa eating some sort of greasy or messy food not had a napkin handy but looked up and saw your dog or cat nearby
conspiracy theory here other cats made rumors about black cats being evil because they jelly that black cats get more warmth from the sun
i ve always said when i can finally get my own cat i want it to be completely black just like this beauty
just looking at this photo is making me feel warm and comfy what a cozy cat
this cat is more beautiful then my whole generation
my gaming nickname for the last years has been voidspasm now it has a whole new meaning
wow this looks just like my cat no collar white patch under neck wtf
so cute i keep seeing all these black cat pictures online and i think why is my cat visiting all these people
speaking of a black kitty in the sun it‚Äôs insane how hot dark colors animal get like they feel like they‚Äôre on fire but they‚Äôre just chill with it
i had a black cat with my ex gf we broke up and i let her keep him even though i loved that cat i hope you are living your best life ser pounce i will always miss you
‚Äúthere are no black cats only cat shaped holes in the world‚Äù god of the small things
fellow sun worshipper my girl does this pose every morning when the sun hits the basking spot in the lounge
i ve never heard a black cat called a void before but now i want to get one and just name it void
i rememeber seeing this picture last summer and saving it on my phone i was drunk at a house party and walked around showing everyone how beautiful this cat is lmao
gt who says not photogenic maybe because these little leds on phone can t compete with literal stars
if that ain t the cutest little fluffball i don t know what is
the only people i ve ever heard say anything about black cats not being photogenic are people posting pics of their black cats kinda tired of it
i love her she s just like mine but yours has her whole tail
my black cat used to be very photogenic but he has anxiety i m not kidding and he bites his fur a lot so he s half black half pink naked but this pic reminded me of him in his younger years lt
photogenic are you sure this one is i mean they did blink when you took the picture p now is she majestic af absolutely
i am so salty that this cat is enjoying their day more than i am
dude i can feel how good that sun feels beautiful kitty too
she is so beautiful her fur shines brighter than my exams soon
the dramatic pose is everything i have a black cat who loves to sit under the lamp and she freaks me out a bit by how much she likes to stare directly into the bulb but she gets that half closed eye blissed out look going lamp is her drug your cat and mine could be light twins
my black kitten has this same smug look on his face when i m on the toilet and he wants pets lol
honesty black cats the most beautiful cats i‚Äôve only ever had black cats for the record i‚Äôm not a warlock
plot twist he actually is white but he is absorbing all black light making it look like he‚Äôs black
worship my glorious shine and perfectly curled tail
does this invisible cat have white skin white paw pads my rescue does and i can t find out why
whenever i try to take a pic of my cat she just looks like a mass of black with yellow eyes
please give the void whatever form of affection it will receive and then double it from me lol
head looks like she s got it on backwards in the cutest way
op is this your adorable precious void what a happy beauty
everything about this picture is perfect i need tater tot in my life
i would like to know who is cutting onions in my car rn in this parking lot cause there ain‚Äôt anyone else in here
omg i have tater tots tonight ot congratulations and good luck
if i were to become what my cat thinks i am i d turn into a couch
off to be what your dog thinks you are so a waitress

congratulations and btw have you considered entering tater tot into a corgi race tater tot would be an awesome name on a winner s cup
‚Äúno one can be fully aware of another human being unless we love them by that love we see potential in our beloved through that love we allow our beloved to see their potential expressing that love our beloveds potential comes true ‚Äù hannibal lecter
i thought the hair in your teeth was a hair on my phone s screen for far too long

love the pair of tater tot and you you love him all the way to the moon and back
is it wrong to ask what ethnicity you are you look white but could be hispanic but you also look like you have native american traits too
corgis set the bar quite high but i am sure you and tater tot will meet all your goals keep calm and corgi on
this genuinely may be the best graduation picture on the internet
neighbor walked by with corgi puppy days ago as i was leaving house i was in front of my front door and crouched and said come here toby he friggin ran thru my legs to my front door wanted to say hello to my dog couldn t care less about me
tater tot might very well be the perfect name for a corgi
haha i have a coffee cup that says the same thing it‚Äôs a great line and so true
do not disappoint your doggo do good things become edumacateded i wanna see a follow up graduation pic
congratulations that s a great picture frame that thing
gadzooks that is one cute couple adorable doggo and hooman
dog people are such losers commit to a real child or you‚Äôre a child yourself
what kind of person does your dog think you are exactly
oh no does my dog expect me to have a college education
congratulations and you can start by giving your good boi lots of treats
i m sure tater tot is already proud of you just graduating now aim for the stars and really blow his mind
there was a kid in one of my middle school classes who called himself a tater tot i‚Äôm sure your dog is way less annoying than he was

such a beautiful picture congratulations amp good luck you‚Äôll kill it
tater tot tater tot tater tot fucking tater tot that is the best name ever for a corgi
you look way more native american than senator warren bet she d be envious if she ever saw this pic
you already are that person don t need to add unnecessary pressure where there need be none no matter what happens you are always perfect lt
the best i ve been able to manage is becoming the asshole my cat thinks i am mission accomplished i guess
that is the lowest goal i have ever seen bragged about
jesus that s a cute dog and i m not really a dog person lol
i support this post in more than one way congratulations on the graduation i love your dog s name being tater tot i love that tater tot is on your graduation cap
things didn‚Äôt work out for daenerys and drogon conquering the world who thanks mmtatertoot and tater tot will work out any better

a hero and their faithful dog fetching an axe for the prince it s almost storybook
oh my tater tot is adorable and i love his name congratulations and best wishes as you enter the next chapter of your life
i have a golden retriever tater tot and he is the goodest boy
your dog thinks you go to the park all day that s why they don t want to be left so parks and rec is it
i like that quite literally everything you post is about your dog that‚Äôs love i need to find me a dog
grats my sis also graduated yesterday what a wonderful day
first step is take the metal out your face i think it s hot but when i hire someone if they got shit in thier face i instantly pass on hiring them

sadly my dog thinks i am an exciting adventurer and am off having lots of fun every day with out her in reality i m just at work so when i come home i have to make up stories because she gets so excited when i talk about my day
honestly upvoted for the quote on the hat absolutely amazing üôèüèªüôèüèª
i don t know what that dog is staring at but it must be amazing
dog is lawful good cat is chaotic neutral cat i will kill you dog i would like to see you try
you need to be careful the cat may be playing but the dog is definitely not playing the dog‚Äôs baring their teeth and while the dog seems to be showing restraint the cat might accidentally get hurt just because it‚Äôs so much smaller
we play cops and robbers they play sabretooth and mammoth
cats always bullied dogs since the beginning of time üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
it‚Äôs always so cute seeing big dogs play carefully my last dog used to play with this puppy great dane this reminded me of that
my dog intentionally annoys my cat so the cat ends up hanging his face dog thinks it s great fun but the cat is like oh you better stop or i swear i ll keep doing this he never does stop
but we re seeing the size of the fight in that pounder
yeah pounds of whooping your ass gets slapped off the sofa
he bares his teeth around the kitten btw never toward it ot at it if you watch closely a dog will nip their owner before that dog does anything to that kitten
whenever i see videos like this i can never tell if the cat is playing
this kind of dog have a soft bite while playing a fluffy bite imo
watching the dogs mouth i did not see the dog ‚Äúbare‚Äù his her teeth
in the red corner weighing in at pounds is robin the dog in the blue corner weighing in at pounds is fluffles the destroyer fight begin
that‚Äôs a brave ass cat the second one of the animals in the house snaps my little kitty runs
have y‚Äôall fr never had a dog amp cat together the golden would destroy that cat if he was actually pissed off amp he would be constantly showing that face not just when the kitty annoys him in a spot the golden doesn‚Äôt want him to be
cat is a asshole has high potential to be on cat whisperer
when you fight your older brother over who‚Äôs turn it is on the xbox
the dogs just using his mouth as we would our hands once we ve had enough or just aren t up for taking shit
yeah i love how the dog doesn t just kill the cat he could easily but instead he s nice
it s the same in my house my pound cat does the same to my pound gentle giant dog
that s a very patient dog and a ball of aggro kitty
oh my god who the fuck would let a cat get that overweight that‚Äôs not funny it‚Äôs fucking cruel
i would like to see this cat stuck in a little barrel
if you love your animal throw away the cheap dry kibble which makes them fat and buy some high grade wet food without the fillers you will be surprised what losing one pound means to a cat
yeah people do this to pets and don‚Äôt feel guilt then at the same time over weight humans are looked down upon doesn‚Äôt make sense to this guy but ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
looks like the poor thing hasn t been getting enough l√∂p
bless your heart i wish you both a lifetime of happiness together

yay congrats you two having had both the puppy and adopting an older dog experiences i will always lean towards adopting adult dogs they are gems cheers to many adventures with dougie

kinda how it went when i got my pups we had just lost our dog and were looking for a new girl to join the family we found the sweetest puppy ever and adopted her a week later we saw the same place we got our puppy from post about the year old mother of my puppy being up for adoption now and we just kind of had to get her years later and they are both perfect additions to the family as long as you don t ask the cat
bless your heart adopting this sweet older guy i m so happy he fits in with your family already as if he was waiting just for you üíñ
aww i m glad dougie s found a good home he looks like he deserves it
i love that you adopted older i have two rescues now and but my next little one will be an older pup for sure nothing breaks my heart more than seeing the older ones abandoned by their families my bf and i are thinking of opening an old dog home amp bar to give them a happy loving place for their last years you made my day üíñüíñ
yessss you are my hero i raised puppy and rescue but in the future as looking to only take in old dogs who need a home i can‚Äôt stand the thought of old puppers being forgot about
it‚Äôs been said that older cats and dogs will pick their owners while they are at the shelter i always wondered if perhaps the owners looked similar to their older owners
i feel like he should be hunting robin williams after they both came out of a board game
look at those sweet eyes congrats he looks like a good boy
thanks for choosing to adopt a senior dogo in need of a good home you re awesome d
holy cow you guys thank you so much for all the love and the gold dougie is just the goodest boy and i‚Äôm so happy that he‚Äôs become a part of our family i hope that we can enjoy many years of fun and snuggles with him
that is wonderful so many old guys never get adopted and they are already potty trained they are through teething and so much to offer
we went looking for a puppy and got an year old def australian shepherd she‚Äôs turned into the greatest change of heart
dougie looks super impressed with his new human he made a good choice
oh my gosh what kind is he he looks so much like my rescue
thank you for adopting a older pup he‚Äôs a very handsome gent
puppies are awesome puppies are also a lot of work it‚Äôs like having a baby literally and a lot of people forget that older dogs often sit in shelters for a long time and are the first to be euthanized at high kill or overcrowded shelters both of my dogs i adopted at yrs old and they romp and play just like young dogs do well maybe not my oldest lady who is turning later this year but she can still hang with the best of them on hikes thank you for giving this lovely lad a home i‚Äôm sure he will surprise you once you get him home and he opens up even more have fun you two
it would be hard for me to pass him too he just looks darn good boy
i adopted an y o hound mix two years ago best decision ever she is so appreciative of the good like she has now
older dogs are the best congrats on meeting your new best friend
oh my gosh he s adorable give that good old boy a hug from me
that size dog will live years longer than a lab nothing old about dougie
you‚Äôre an amazing person for adopting this sweet guy üòç i got my own girl when she was she‚Äôs now and still acts like a puppy ‚ù§Ô∏è
he is gorgeous congratulations on your new senior baby
come one doug teach me how to dougie teach me how to dougie
he‚Äôs laughing at his own jokes he‚Äôs amazing and so lucky to have you
thank you you probably saved his life he will one day when you‚Äôre down return the favor
adult adoptions are the best you ve done a good thing and doggie knows it many great years ahead of you
i am so happy for you and dougie if you haven t realized already older pups have a staunch appreciation for the life you give them they know they were saved they just know it and they are beyond grateful he is so happy you picked him you can see it in his face
oh my goodness look how happy he is he s such a good boi i love him
i love my senior dogs i have raised one puppy in my life and i will never do it again adult dogs and senior dogs can still be playful and cute like a puppy but they re typically less destructive with better bladder control there s also no guesswork about what the dog will grow up to be sure with rescues there s bound to be some personality changes as they adjust to their new home but in my experience most of those changes have been positive
thank you for adoption an old boy i m going to be working in a shelter once i m done school so thank you
his eyes and little smile have so much character i can tell he is going to be the sweetest little dog
thank you so so much for being a good person and doing this he looks so happy it brings tears of joy to my eyes
obviously she gave birth to the cat it s everybody this can happen now
this isn‚Äôt right and is not what it‚Äôs about delete this post
if i had one this color it would be real hard not to name it habanero bell pepper or something similar
should of called him helios because he kind of looks like the sun
why does he look like he‚Äôs about to save me or more on car insurance
no i m good with auto insurance right now thanks though
adorable good luck my leopard gecko is about years old now
aw looks like she just shed leopard geckos are blessed
don‚Äôt let her near any redheads with old timey clothing
i have four geckos only yellow but no orange that lizards super rare
and here i thought ‚Äúluna‚Äù was reserved for cats and dogs now geckos too what‚Äôs next turtle lunas hamster lunas cockatiel lunas come up with better names people they cant all be luna got me going loony over here
awesome gecko i ve got a tangerine leo too her name is charmie short for charmander
why luna i know luna means moon but it is an interesting name for an orange gecko
i m considering getting one since my building doesn t allow cats or dogs i want a pet that i can actually play with rather then fish or something i ve been reading up on these guys and they qss re at the top of my list do you find yours playful or a pet that prefers to be left alone
looking into the camera thinking what the hell do you want now
my sister had an albino one of these took me a second to recognize it with the normal coloring cutie
great job op that looks like a well fed happy leopard gecko i m always ecstatic to see them with all their toes you clearly take wonderful care of her
that was almost cartoon like when the dog sort of floats to his arms
i know this has been reposted a bunch but i don t even care every time i see it i just miss my old girl love you sami
the level of trust exhibited by this gorgeous girl is why we don‚Äôt deserve dogs this is so beautiful i‚Äôm crying
i was literally expecting to see another dog iamanidiot
what did we do as humans to desrve such animals unlike cats
almost a year goes by and the little fella still hasn‚Äôt grown any
only the th time i ve seen this on this site ready to make times
watched this more times than i am willing to admit waiting for him to grow up
on its best day disney never made anything cuter than a real duckling
having duck la ronge this evening this clip will make it time better
he looks just like my old girl june if he‚Äôs even half as good a good boy as she was a good girl you‚Äôre gonna have the bestest best friend for life
our dogs must be twins let me find a picture and post it
congrats he‚Äôs beautiful and i can tell he is already very much loved
he looks like the goodest boy congrats to both of you
i had a thought that might make people mad but hear me out we can all agree kill shelters are bad right it would be in the best intrest of the animal lover to adopt from those shelters because they adopt from kill shelters they are funding the kill shelter thus keeping the kill shelters open boycotting kill shelters would stop killshelters but will also kill a lot of pets unfortunately unless im wrong in which case please educate me
there i put myself in timeout so you didnt have to were even now right hooman
it couldn t have been me i ve been in my crate the whole time
i must be tired because i read that as puppy recognizes its milkshakes
i could hear the swoosh when the food bowl came into the picture
i love how when he starts running away he glances to take one last look at the food and then keeps running hahahah
reminds me of something about a year ago i was sweeping the floors and our lab was helping out she loves when we sweep under the couch because she gets to find her toys again i find something and i throw it to her so i finish up one couch and move to the next one as i move the couch away from the wall shelby goes from happy to sad and she slowly takes off to the bedroom i thought that s weird she only does that when she s done something wr oh when i moved the couch away from the wall a shampoo bottle was behind the couch and once she saw it she knew she was busted she had grabbed the shampoo bottle and went behind the couch to chew on it so there was the missing shampoo my wife was pretty sure we had answers to the questions i can think of because our stupid shower does not have a door only a curtain yes we learned to close the bathroom door and all doors probably happened when we weren t home and our daughter should have been paying attention to the dog
those chinese people beat those dogs into that type of behavior
jesus look at all that food no wonder all corgis are fat and useless
this is how my pupper is too straight to the crate lol
reminds of entertainment s place who has a house like that
love the lil brakes the pup put on and skittered off to the sin bin lolü§£ü§£ü§£
ha i m actually not a fan of corgi s but when the puppy closes that door lt
miss me with that shit uh uh fuck that am just gon lock myself in here you go ahead and clean that up
when you d rather go to prison and get free room and board than work another day in your life to pay off your debts
loved it so live and smart doesn t help you to clean up the mess lol
seek veterinary advice promptly would be my suggestion
i think the only answer is that you should take her to a vet
youve definitely posted this in the wrong sub need to find a vet advice topic
it looks like its heart was born outside theres a name for this condition but im not sure what it is take it to the nearest animal hospital or vet as soon as possible and see if anything can be done
wtf are you doing taking pictures of the poor thing call a vet
yeah that s a herniated abdominal wall it might not make it i m sorry
there‚Äôs a condition for this and it‚Äôs where internal organs develop outside the body take that thing to the vet
for people who tell me go to the vet is already midnight in my town please i want this dog to live so don t just tell me to the vet if the vet still open i would probably go without asking it here
most vet offices have an emergency contact open hrs please try and call anyways
do they not have a hr service as a backup or a number you can call for after hours maybe call and they have something listed on their voicemail good luck
why aren t people upvoting this more right now hedgies are the cutest
there s a chance she s just preparing her dinner source i own a pigmy hedgehog whilst highly unlikely in this picture they tend to eat their offspring quite often at least when in captivity never seen myself but it s not uncommon to hear about it
if it s a hedgehog wouldn t the baby be a hamlet uh yeah i ll see myself out now
i was today years old when i learned a puppy hedgehog is a hoglet
hoglet sounds so freking cute i m going to start using this with my loved ones
how cute i had no idea they carried their young like that
i wonder if this is the critter equivalent to carrying your toddler like a surf board lol they youngin s are just hanging out minding their own business and enjoying the ride
she s probably just eaten the rest and is saving that one for later thanks for bringing back that childhood trauma
oh i recognize that carry and walk he acted out in the store
but mooooom i gotta go fast not till you finish your homework young man
never really thought about how they carried their young before i guess part of me just assumed their spines let the babies stick to their mom like velcro
still looks better than that sonic the hedgehog trailer
the first day of school at hedgehogwarts is always scary
‚Äúmommmm you‚Äôre embarrassing me in front of my friends‚Äù
the word hoglet is blessed but now i wonder if they use that word to describe sonic the hedghog s children in fanfiction
i have no idea why i thought that said hot mama and her hoglet
i don t think hoglet has ever been a biological term interesting though
i honestly had no idea hedgehogs existed out of captivity
chances are she s eating it hedgehog eat their babied
german word for hedgehog is igel but pronounced like eagle majestic hedgehogs
something something the new sonic the hedgehog movie looks great
i absolutely love hedgehogs and this made me cry tears of joy i hope spiked mother and spiked child made it to their destination and lived happily ever after
that‚Äôs a big hedgehog i thought they stayed pretty small
anything is a dildo if you‚Äôre brave enough and i have a sonic fetish
at first i thought this hedgehog was carrying it s toupee
i think that expression on her face is a universal mom on the go thing eyes bugged out slightly panicked
the little hedgehog is called ic its her son ic the hedgehog
i‚Äôm gonna be the one to spoil the party loooool but if you do see a hedgehog out in the daytime please assess the situation and call a wildlife rescue for advice they are nocturnal animals and usually will be struggling with pretty heavy parasite loads if spotted out in the daylight they also do not tend to move their young between nests as in this photograph unless they have been disturbed once disturbed there is a high risk the mother will abandon the babies still cute tho source hedgehog scientist üë©‚Äçüéì
rly theyre called hoglet i thogt the pronoun for hedgehog is hogwash and noun is hogwarts example hagrid from hogwarts went to the wards to remove his warts but he said the price is hogwash
taking sonic back to the drawing board for extensive revisions
are you sure that s not a porcupine returning from the barber sure looks like it
never thought the first time i see a wild hedgehog it would be walking downtown
yo sure she aint just hungry üòã cause the be doing shit like thatüò±
sick cannibal hedgehog proudly marches off to feast on the innocent young it just stole from traumatised mother
if evangelion taught me anything it s that they ll end up hurting each other
i thought they were being run over with the bike wheel at first glance i
i m having a few bad days in my life now and when i see what this mama does and fights my worries seem so much less worrying go mama
do hedgehogs just roam streets or something how common are they things u need to know
i ve never seen their legs that s how they walk i always thought they kinda hover over the ground
this must be a european hedgehog african pygmy hedgehogs are smaller my lil hedgie would not like this lol hedgie are adorbs
this is off topic but i did not know that baby hedgehogs are called hoglets i think this is the best news i‚Äôve received all day
carl is getting grounded for spending so much money on his travels wish carl good luck
can t get over the front foot looks like she s prancing
at first i was like wtf does a hedgehog want with a pinecone
adorable you know if they get upset they will eat their babies
i ve always wondered why they were called hogs and now i see why she looks like a little spiky pig
i was today years old when i discovered a baby hedgehog was called a hoglet in retrospect infeel kinda stupid for not knowing
best thing i have seen all day so freaking adorable
holy shit i ve never ever thought of them as hogs the name is right there but still never put and together til
they re called hoglet they re called hoglet they re call fucking hoglet
not gonna lie thought this hedgehog was being run over by a bike for a second and was v concerned
i gave you a gold as seeing that this morning has made my day thank you gold ü•á
i love hedgehogs we have a little cabin at the end of our garden and one day my dad found a little shit in the middle of the room he reckoned it was hedgehog shit and that a hedgehog had gotten into the room and nested inside he left food out in there one night and sure enough next morning it was gone next day we found the little guy nesting in a plastic bag in the corner of the room so we broke him her out of there as he she was weak and very hungry my dad got a plastic box with hay and set it up in the garden and fed him her for a few days until he she felt better and wandered off after that he she kept coming back but it come back with babies and kept visiting the garden every night to eat the food my dad left out for them so precious haha
these are the cutest ahh i wish i could have one as a pet i m not sure if that s legal though üòÇ
the old sonic discarding the new trashy cinematic sonic
so is hoglet the actual name for hedgehog babies or is it something you made up
i think the kitty is pleased with your choice as well
my mother would ve flipped her lid when i was young if i had my face that close to the cats claw like that is the cat declawed
now put a st louis jersey on the cat and watch a beauty of a barn burner bud
hopes it s a new blues jersey he s gonna need one next week
‚Äúalways‚Äù isn‚Äôt really that long in this case but it‚Äôs great the kid got a cat
nice b‚Äôs jersey oh and the kitty and kid are cool too üëç
that smile and happy eye squint ion the little boy priceless‚ù£Ô∏èüê±üòä
of course he wanted a kitty he wants to exterminate the rat
ummm your cat looks a lot like my kitten named boo can i see the front of your cats face bc he has spots and a toupee on his head too
he s even rubbing the kitty right he wants to really grab the kitty but he is so good he won t frame this picture he is such a star
such pure joy it‚Äôs great and to see him make the same face of adoration i do as a year old cat owner and i‚Äôm stoked for lil dude‚Äôs years to come with a lil fuzzy homey
i know this isn‚Äôt relevant to the post but what is your child‚Äôs racial mix he‚Äôs adorable cat is cute too surprised it didn‚Äôt take swipes at him knowing cats üê±
should probably of got him a better jersey haha joking aside cute pic p s anyonebutboston
does the kitty have a pink or black nose looks like my year old he s got a black nose though
he s lucky he got a sweet one üòÇ this is very cute and i m glad he has this friend the bond we form with animals is really special i broke up with my girlfriend that i live with recently and i am going to be so devastated when i say goodbye to her cats
i am sure that kitty will enjoy its very realistic human baby doll present
best video today i love the kitty mews the baby was like hugging it
yes those kittens are definitely too young to get addicted to babies
this is our sister she is very big and quite hairless but she is our protector and we love her
this is a very cute video but the rat tail at seconds
they learn quick where the safest place on a baby is lmao
as it should be kitties and puppies early mean kids who are not allergic to them and who will be compassionate towards animals
ok but to be honest little babies have such soft skin n little kitten claws are so sharp
it‚Äôs good for children to be exposed to cats and dogs at a young age it bolsters their immune system
i think the first time i ve ever actually said aw to a baby video usually shown to me in front of the parents or whatever so i force one the kittens definitely were the highlight for me but when that kid hugged the kitten on accident it was still super cute i want to think i was born into a mess of kittens why else would i be utterly obsessed i don t hate babies i just generally don t think they are too cute it s all about opinion
oh my god this is maybe the best thing i ve ever seen
yes infect them with toxoplasmosis young out cat overlords will be pleased they will reward you with an extra dead mouse this year
probably the cutest damn thing i seen a snake do haha
kenyan sand boa i love them mine is and they are really fun
what about the poor cat when he s using that litter box
it‚Äôs all fun and games until the cat goes to the wrong litter box
i feel like that snake should have displaced more sand than it did
i love how at the end his head pops out of the sand like oh hai
stupid question but how can it breath under the sand
usul we have wormsign the likes of which even i think is completely adorable
please capture it before you let any little kids play in the sand
wait i swear i had one of the children sized versions of that sandbox
amazing how something can be posted a bunch of times and still reach thousands of people that have never seen it before the internet sure is vast and sometimes underwhelming
thats how they getcha they re under the goddamn ground lookin for cuddles
they way it comes out at the end i can just imagine it saying thanks dad mom
i never thought i‚Äôd say this but that snake is fucking adorable
i m not a huge fan of snakes but that s some cute shit right there
sandbox brings back memories our giant one was lost to high winds
there is a lack of snakes on this sub thank you for this
can someone pls reverse this so it looks like the turtle is having a weird poop
i wish i knew of this when i had my baxter i can seee how it s condusive for warmth and shedding
next time you go to beach remember there could be thousands of snakes just below the surface
if i didn t see a human hand i would think that s a full size turtle pool and a big snake
did anybody else have sandboxes that were like this
well there‚Äôs another fear to add to my list of beach fears
wow thats heckin adorable btw its spelt snek and this is clearly a baby sandworm someone call muad dib
i legit held my phone out as far away from my face as i could to watch this i was really worried it was going to pop out quick and scare the jeepers out of me what a pleasant little cute ending you cute little snek you gt lt
it makes me uncomfortable knowing snakes don t blink and that sand is touching it s eyes
great now i have a new fear all the sand now has snakes under it all of the sand
i never thought i would say this but that snake is flippin adorable that happy face can‚Äôt deal
ok this sub has gone too far this will get downvoted to oblivion but i don‚Äôt care this needs to be said so many of these posts aren‚Äôt cute at all i‚Äôve seen some ugly animals here with k upvotes half of the posts on these subs are ‚Äúmeet blank‚Äù and the animal is disabled i understand that it‚Äôs horrible that the animal is disabled and it‚Äôs a horrible thing but a dog with one eye isn‚Äôt cute neither are snakes or bats
oh mighty shai hulud bless the maker and his water bless the coming and going of him may his passage cleanse the world
many times saw this video and just now realized it must feel soooo good for the snake remember how you dip your hand in the warm sand at the beach now imagine that feeling all over your body
now the snake is inside the frog how the tables have turned
if that was warm sand that snake would just curl up and fall asleep in there
can confim kinetic sand is amazing bought some for my daughter that i now use
oh my god i thought it was going into the carpet and was like wtf üòÇüòÇüòÇ
i could watch this for hours so relaxing happy sneaky happy me ü•∞
aaaww danger noodle got someone wot loves them to bits yeah
the shocked look of the turtle as the snake does unspeakable things
should be illegal to put snakes on this subreddit üòÇüòÇ i do have a fear of snakes but still üòÇ
truly awww and that little head popping out at the end was the best
i was just waiting for that little head to pop out so worth it
honestly i ve seen this so many times and without fail every time when the little snek pops out i go awww this will never not be cute
if you want to feel old this has been reposted for two years
we had kenyan sand boas cutest damn snakes in the world and so friendly
i both love and am terrified by this mild aversion to snakes but hiiis so cute
sand boas are soo cool they re like real life graboids
i live in australia this makes me not wanna go to the beach again
i used to have the same sand box when i was younger
is it just me or does it look like that turtle has seen some shit
usul we have wormsign the likes of which even god has never seen
i‚Äôm no snake but i‚Äôm guessing that feels really good
cute what are you all thinking that‚Äôs a fucking snek hiding in the sand waiting to eat me when i walk on him
i had a sand boa they are some of the easiest snakes to care for mine lived over years
that s waffle the danger noodle look up the video on youtube it was posted about years ago i think
i am imagining the sand as warm and the snake sighing aaahhhh when they get in
this is sandpit turtle i ll honestly love you if you get this reference
i don‚Äôt understand how they breathe also what about the eyes
and now you put it in the oven at for hours and serve with carrots and peas
surprise a cat as seen on tv do you have a cat who you want to shit outside just use ‚Äúsurprise a cat ‚Äù your cat will never feel what bit him recommend for use with non venomous snakes use this product at your own risk surprise a cat is not responsible for deceased or eaten animals it‚Äôs a snake this is a joke
hi helen saw this cutie on reddit and thought of you and your snake see you tomorrow üòä
aww a tiny version of the turtle sandbox enjoy little buddy i know i loved my people sized one ‚ù§
this is a visual representation of the new bring me the horizon album
snakes are cool but i will never understand how some people think they are cute
please stop reposting this i have seen this on youtube tumblr instagram and now here unless this is the original owner reposting their own video years after the first time please just stop this is a repost and obviously stolen
dang it s like it s going into absolutely no where must be nice
i kind of expected the ending but not how cute it was or spoiler alert gt the final blep lt
lil shai hulud looking to wreck some lil spice harvesters
i d never thought i d look at a snake and think awe cute but today it happened
this new toy had been posted so many times it doesn t really classify as new anymore

come on pop your head out please yes yes yes my emotions while watching this
they snek they sneak but most importantly they love to peak

as i just got home from work and i have monday off this will be me for days
what s wrong with your dog looks like hes been smushed
when you re cutting out soda and lay there thinking of all the fizzy pop you could inhale if only you wanted to die at
when you lie in bed and realise you forgot the homework
i must be high i thought he was mounted to the wall for a sec
cat fur is like a pillow they take everywhere so they can nap anytime they want
for the really big burritos i like to fold the first flap lengthwise and then fold in the sides as you go two turns fold in the sides more this creates a nice seal throw them in a pan minutes on each side for that restaurant crisp outside
hold up hold up hold up your trying to tell me a child of a hispanic mother does not know how to wrap a burrito i m calling shenanigans
omg i didn t know this your mum is awesome and now i need to have fajitas tomorrow only to practice of course
learned while working at subway this knowledge has served me well
she had places to be and things to do bet she is happy to be exploring her new home
happy gotcha day sweetheart have a great life in your new forever home lt
she s adorable congratulations on your new family member she had so much to say to you already lt
so cute congratulations she looks a lot like my cat
oh let me guess the song she sang went like this meow meeeow meeeewww meow its a classic my little girl sings it all the time too
this kitten will drink all your vodka and stay up all night
oh you‚Äôre going to love that ‚Äúserenading‚Äù in the morning when the sun comes up
look at those little fangs i am a furrrrrious predatorrrr üòàüòàüòà
she looks like her owner is walking away and she‚Äôs like ‚Äúnooooooooo‚Äù
she‚Äôs actually been doing this all over the country cleaned me out of toquitos but i‚Äôm not upset
congrats that cute face will let her get away with a lot of antics
oh dear god when we took our first cat home she was crying serenading the whole hours car ride home she fell asleep the moment we arrived home but it was an ordeal driving with a cat on full volume meowing every seconds
oh my sweetiepie goofball did the same thing he literally yelled at me until i came and got him out of the cage then i noticed his decorous quiet brother behind them he was speaking for the two of them now they rule the roost here at home congrats on your new family member she is a live wire and will bring so much fun and laughter and sweetness and purring into your life
and she ll never stop serenading you lol i love chatty cats
wouldn t call this serenading but i love it and am happy for you both
she‚Äôs so adorable i hope you have another cat at home for her to play with or if not that you‚Äôll consider adopting a companion for her it really is so easy to take care of more cat when you already have having a buddy also makes it so that when they‚Äôre feeling active those precious hours of night that you‚Äôre getting beauty sleep they‚Äôre playing with each other and not you it‚Äôs beneficial for both you and her and saves another kitten üòª
your new kitten is so cute happy she has a new loving home ‚ù§Ô∏èüò∏
you might find the serenading cute now but you will regret it hard later
no it isn t it s just a staged photo of a cat standing on some shoes
my cat always wears my shoes whenever i take them off then she s just chilling in my shoes until dinner i should get her her own pair of shoes
no it isn t it s just a staged photo of a cat standing on some shoes why you got to lie for karma cats don t care about attention
shes wearing them i hope you told her they look good on her
straight hours of belly scratches or the shoes get it
mine has discovered that when i unscrew the valves to put air into my bike tires i m going to leave her and she does the saddest little whine
here let me put my cat in my nasty ass sneakers and tell everyone that she stepped into them and then reap the internet karma points
this is you in shoes look how dumb it looks just stay home please
top ten people who can stop thanos even with the infinity gauntlet
bro your new balances are so tight looking like chris raab in cky
a super soaker should work if not try a high pressure hose
lol my cat slapped me in the face once when i was working out
do lions also suddenly extend their razor sharp claws for no reason while playing like me cat does
ever seen a man in the missionary position with a lion oddly enough i have now
that pick up hug of ‚Äúcome here my sweet baby aw who‚Äôs a good boy ‚Äù
in bubbles voice that s one f ckin nice kitty right there
for a little bit at the end there its almost like its moved from love to lunch
can you imagine if house cats greeted you like this everyday instead of not giving a fuck about you
personally having kind of a shitty day this at least made me smile thanks for that
this is what happens when i come home from work and my cat sees me
i‚Äôm so jelly i want a lion so bad just don‚Äôt wanna end up dinner though so ima hold off
i mean i could do that too if i could spend hours a day cuddling a lion cub since birth uh so where do i sign up to cuddle lion cubs
they really are just bigger versions of house cats someone give him a cardboard box to play with
big cats remind me of that one dumb black lab teeth thinks he s still a puppy
idk there just too powerful to trust when they get bigger
thank god he got full body control when he did i thought he was a goner
very cool and a big thank you to him for the rescue
people forget that even though lions are big cats they‚Äôre still cats big ol kitty cats
wait a year the same scene will be just as adorable and a lot funnier
it‚Äôs not every day you see a dog that can speak whale
best thing on the internet today heal quickly bowser
mooooooooooo that‚Äôs a strange looking cow ya got there
aww this made my day hope you feel better soon bowser
looks like a shepherd my shep mix howls at sirens too he taught my other dog how to do it it s quite the chorus
my dogs always try to harmonize with sirens not fun considering i leve across the street from the hospital down the street from out fd and the pd is one block in the other direction
the softest awoooos aww can anyone answer why some dogs howl at sirens and some don t i had a pure black lab that would howl at sirens but my staffylab doesn t give a hoot about them
please someone remix this into bowser s theme from mario
interesting my dog jack russell only howled two times in his life his one was at a siren too other was to church bell none of this situations he was sedated or anything similar cute pup love that mole
wow my phone was literally vibrating due to the sound from the speaker
this is every drunk middle aged woman singing journey on karaoke night at midnight
oh hey our dogs share a name your boy is so handsome hope he enjoys all the awoos
i d like to think that in his head he was howling like the alpha grey wolf on a hunt
hey do you know his breed at all cause your dog looks just like my dog
i have a pet named bowser too i call him bowzeezy and bowzizzle and also the notorious b o w s e r
brings back childhood memories of playing rpm records on the rpm setting
damn it is so funny watching animals trying to behave normal while high from surgeries i m sure everything sounded perfectly normal in his head
you ever hear that sound police cars make in film and tv after they wreck this is what it sounds like
we need to find our way toooooo sydneeeeeeyyyyyy we are trying to find his sooooooooonnnn
i think your ‚Äúdog‚Äù is actually a cow disguised as a dog
my good pupper does this whether she s on drugs or not
i love the little spots german shepards have by their mouths
i just played this for my corgi who is usually very offended if she hears any other dog noises in our house she did not even recognize this as a dog get well soon bowser
i just realised that bowser is a near perfect name for a dog
canine equivalent of drunken karaoke yes i m saying you sound like shit
he looks so much like my dog harvey where did you get him
even a doped up shep can get some howls in while mine can t seem to figure it out she just whines and grunts like a warthog anytime her mal pal starts howling and talking
don‚Äôt you dare laugh at bowser he‚Äôs doing his darn best
thats how my golden howls sober aka he has no idea how to howl

my first dog was named bowser he was such a good boy and so is yours this made my day
my old shelties howl sounds like this on a regular basis lol
sounds very much like me as i wake up in the morning
i had a golden retriever that would howl just like that sometimes but it was his playful howl not drugged howl he would do it if he was in just too good of a mood to break out the full howl
what siren and is he really drugged or is your dog just lazy howling mine does used to do rip this all the time
i don t know what i like more the fact his name is bowser or that he speaks whale
i think this is the doggie equivalent of speaking softly while hungover hope the siren wailer feels better soon
i‚Äôm not fan of certain hillbilly figures of speech but this is a ‚Äúbless his heart‚Äù scenario if i ever saw one
who let s their dog howl at sirens or anything please be considerate of your neighbors
shepard dingo mix mine used to do the same thing but not just after surgery he wasn t too bright sometimes
i hope he‚Äôs doing better since his surgery both of mine do this every chance they get and harmonize with the rest of the good boys in our neighborhood we live far enough from the main city streets that they miss more sirens than they catch but it‚Äôs out of a desire to protect and alert their people so i try to remember that when they start howling at
he s trying to signal that he is smelling drugs in this location
one of our shepherds always started like that but after a few false starts would join the siren in singing out gloriously to the world but then he wasn t chillin on meds post surgery
that s one of the most pathetic sounds i ve ever heard
this cutie looks a lot like my german shepherd mix even down to the beauty mark i hope he feels better soon
chewbacca is that you dory from the ocean awoooouuououuuu
my dog howls like this not drugged up hes a yo shepsky its hilarious
my parent‚Äôs goldens make this noise normally when they want food or attention they won‚Äôt howl for shit
literally me trying to have conversation at the tail end of any drunk night
haha my dog liked your dog‚Äôs howling and licked my ipad
almost sounds like the lady dragon in shrek when the crew escaped fiona‚Äôs castle
it s so cool to see how similar he looks to my dog bruce
i think your doggo is out of gas better supply some snacks amp noms
commenting so i can come back in a quieter environment
awww poor bowser keep tryin buddy you ll feel better
sounds like your skeksis is looking to catch some gelfling
my year old cat rarely cares about anything she really didn t like this though
how high is he and what is he on cause that shit seems good
there was an attempt seriously though at the end it seemed like even he was confused by his howl either way i love him
for a second there i thought you d named yoir dog browser and i was oddly cool with it
my childhood dog was named bowser he was a schnauzer
this is literally my water pipes when i run the hose outside
just enough gray to look dignified without looking old
awww he or she looks amazing my husky border collie is a bit stiff lately and deaf as a post but he keeps up with his younger brothers lt
hey there barley your just sweet sixteen hope you have many many more
i m years old in dog years and i have a lot more gray than this pretty baby lol
story of this guy went in to buy a goldfish from the pet shop local rescue had a picture of him on the bulletin board instead of a goldfish i went home with a dog fast forward to today he visits the vet once a month and is as healthy as could be has some mild arthritis and gets tired easily going a little blind and deaf but still recognizes me when i get home he should see many more birthdays
what a handsome pupper what have you fed him he‚Äôs aged incredibly well good on you

oh he is so cute and fluffy i just want to give him lots of pets and snuggles
my year old girl just passed last month hope you and yours have many more happy birthdays
sorry for your loss she‚Äôs chasing squirrels in heaven
hi just curious which food do you feed this good boy i d like to make my one year old dog last as long as possible
hes beautiful also must have some great genetics may he live many more years
he got nametags tho that clearly means he reincarnates in an even fluffier pupper at the age of
he looks very content the best way for a year old doggo to look
he s really cute he looks like a big dog a lion and a dwarf dog all in one je only lools about what s his secret
barley graying cough coug you domt see all the black fur
the goodest boy looks like he has a kevlar vest in the thumbnail obviously knows he must be prottected
that dog has alot of miles left and he is a handsome and very good boy with sweetboi eyes love him dearly and give him a pat from me
raccoons are like little monkeys look at those little hands
animals are wonderful and when wild animals are friendly to people and other species it‚Äôs really special to see
hi rocky you were such a great actor congrats on the film s success
little king trash mouth and his husband gary were renewing their vows i think
this is how i m going to get rabies some day i m okay with it
looked for a good parks and rec meme about racoons and couldn t find any was severely dissapointed
i saved a raccoon once because it was stuck in a dumpster she lived at our house for a few days and then we released her into the wild she came around a lot after word though
a raccoon killed my cat not aww worthy they are nasty little varmints with posable thumbs very dangerous
don t worry op us beatles fans see what you did there
it s all cute until the test results are in smart wicked ill intentioned rabid animal after bats your ignorance is bad enough but do some research dipshit and it s rabid rocky racoon cheers
i read this in bobby hill‚Äôs voice hi rocky you are precious
all i can think about is that scene on elf does somebody need a hug raccoon hisses and attacks
it took my cat nearly months to forgive my wife for bringing a new cat home
after buying litter mates i would do it again every single time they play together eat together sleep together even go to the bathroom at the same time well they do take turns
"hahaha the little one is smiling while the other is
just pissed with the whole situation i‚Äôm easy to amuse"
hahaha i can t stop laughing at the title how did it devolve so quickly
weeks color me jealous it s been months and the queen of my house still cannot abide the existence of the interloper
omgosh i had one of these type beds for my hamham i miss colin
for how small the sleeping bag is that turn around was impressive
i love hamsters but there s a chance he s already pooped in seconds he s been in there
i was about to say that they should make those for humans then i realized they are called sleeping bags
i didn t give you permission to publish my likeness mate
hamster names are some of the most creative ones out there observe my hamsters name is hammy
aw i miss hamsters but i bet my husband would kill me if i got some of those seen as we already have a bunny and a dog üòÖ
i own one of those dinky sleeping bag phone cases now i m going to have to donate it to the hamster gods
the claustrophobia i would feel i feel anxious just looking at this
why have i never tried chewing on a pillow to fluff it
i had a dream once i was eating a giant marshmallow i woke up and my pillow was gone
i need this for my hammo anyone know where i could possibly order it
i ve never seen a bastard orphan more in need of a break

he might hamham but he‚Äôs not hamham don‚Äôt ham hamham
damn this just reminded me of that show hamtaro which used to be a secret guilty pleasure of mine
what s with the music is he a forest shopkeeper from a link to the past
right behind corgis hamsters have the most beautiful bums
richard gere pocket asshole for your hamsters pleasure
i have a small fancy hamster like or dwarf hamster long but just as round where can i get a hed for my hamster i think my hamster is smaller than the one in this film
my family used to have a hamster and we would take an old sock cut it in half and put the toe end in its cage half the time he would use it like a sleeping bag and the other half he would pull it over himself like a blanket in his nest
this is absolutely adorable and of course it is in japan
that tune is almost as disturbing as the lavender town song
aaaand now i‚Äôve got the hamtaro opening song in my head after years of forgetting it existed thanks now i‚Äôm off to find a way to binge the series
"fuzzy little hamster sleeping in his sack
warm and cozy he ll never give it back"
i ve bought many similar for my ferret he liked to chew through the damn thing and sleep in an inner inner pocket
my childhood hamster s name was hamham my mom was a dork and always called for him as sterster lol thank you for reminding me of this memory
just making the bed fluffing the pillow and goodnight
i hope you don t have a scary sounding voice xd this is beautiful though
please get a video of you reading stories to kids or something cause that would be awesome
how many thousands of pounds would you make me one for
if i had the money i d be going to cons in your sloth costume with a space suit
i feel like masha is going to burst through the door and disrupt the peace and quiet of the bear in
sit very still and wait for people to go by before moving suddenly
add a cigarette and suddenly its corporal wojtek a bear who served in ww
when halloween comes round wear it and charge trick or treaters
reminds me of that disney movie wear this young bear is adopted by humans iirc does anybody remember that movie
imagine you break into someone s house and you see this
this made me think of the move ‚Äòthe hotel new hampshire‚Äô
well if that doesn t make you aww i don t know what will
duck strange i feel an urge in my mind to move around in this stuff and immerse myself in it also to poop everywhere
but does it know how to oil itself up to stay floating
amazing how instinct works he‚Äôs literally programmed for it
did you make the duck bath warm or leave it cold like it would be in nature
baby duck i just had this strange urge to swim as hard as i could i swam
my cat had a similar reaction when we got a christmas tree oh i was built for this
cue sarah mclaughlin in the aaaarrrmmms of an aaangel far awaaaayyy
oh my heart my dog would look at me just like that all the time he was a miniature schnauzer who passed away last july he looked like an old wise pooch with puppy dog eyes
aww wire haired doxie dont see many of those on here
what kind of pup is this my rescue doggie looks almost identical but i haven‚Äôt been able to figure out what he‚Äôs mixed with
my fianc√©e and i have a lhasa apso and she has the exact same eyes
i m not even a small dog person but that dog would be mine and would sleep next to me every night
in germany they are called dackel and i love them often elderly women own them so when i was in my grandmas hood full of retirees i would go up to every granny with a dackel and ask if i could pet them i petted so many dackels
i‚Äôve been having a hard day but this just gave me a big heart smile ‚ô•Ô∏è thank you for the share
someone stole someones girlfriend and he can t even get mad about it
that is the cutest thing i ever seen in my entire life absolutely precious
he has mastered the puppy eyes ahhh this is dangerous to my heart
that baby can ask for literally anything and i would totally make it come true
that dog could burn an orphanage and get away with it
i groom a dog like this and she is just like that they are so sweet
dogs with mustaches and eyebrows will always be my favorite
dachshunds need so much love just to get through the day
my beagle does the role on my hand thing too someone loves their people
question do they have to be groomed to have that look or is hair naturally shorter like that
puppy dog eyes get me every time if this little guy bit my finger off i would say thank you
is he a yorkie dachshund i have one and he has the exact same body hair and those eyes üòç he‚Äôs and turning grey himself but he‚Äôs still my sweet baby
when you fuck up something but your parents don t see it yet
i once had a miniature schnauzer named poppy and i loved him he‚Äôd never let anyone else hold him until he met me i remember holding in my hands after the first day we got him from our neighbors and i couldn‚Äôt help but remember in nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off h–µll in a cell and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer s table
maybe he wanted some ink nice little scene of a deer firing a rifle at a hunter picture of bambi s mom with never forget underneath
true story if you don‚Äôt stimulate their anus is this the right way to say that they die a good luck from mama makes them poop my dad still has a childhood trauma learnt that lesson the hard way when bambi collapsed on him he‚Äôs now and still spreads the word about existential bambi habits
i‚Äôd be keeping it also your beard is lit as the kids would say
you should never touch a fawn your sent can cause the mother to reject her fawn big time no no just for a photo opportunity
just because hes wearing a camo hat doesnt mean he should be dropped off in the woods geez
check your beard for ticks seriously i m not kidding lyme disease is a motherfucker
as long as he s safe were his mama can find him again
nothing like lime disease first thing in the morning
not smart turning away a paying customer like that he just wanted to spend a few bucks
tattooing is a calling very few are in it for the doe
dude he wanted a shoulder piece to commemorate his mom and yo just throw him back into the wild s
as a random thing be careful posting shit like this some areas have asshole game wardens that will come after you for handling wildlife a friend of mine had an old in ground pool it had issues so he converted it into a back yard fish farm having a dirt pond and putting bass in it for fishing apparently is fine but a concrete pond is illegal
nobody gonna talk about how the bambi looks more gangster than any thug you ever seen before
poor things mother was probably hit by a tesla i heard elon musk had the auto pilot team program the cars to go after deer
he looks pretty wild ‚Äî glad you sent him back to the woods one question though how does a deer run a tattoo shop like how do you even hold the instruments
love how everyone is terrified of the ticks where i live you learn to check after a day in the woods but we don‚Äôt ‚Äúfear‚Äù them
it‚Äôs mom is probably going to abandon it now all for a selfie
i swear every tattoo artist look the same i say that because my old tattoo artist from washington looks just like you
if you didn‚Äôt find the mom it‚Äôs most certainly going to die
just an fyi there are diseases that can transfer from cervid to human so maybe don t kiss any more deer
he‚Äôs not safe you‚Äôre not supposed to touch him his family won‚Äôt be able to identify him now and he will die of starvation or predators don‚Äôt touch them wild animals people call animal services
hey bro how much for a sleeve like from shoulder to hoof
you have a doppelg√§nger i literally thought this was my friend
uh a fawn wandering around like that approaching humans aka percieved predators is likely orphaned i hope you called a wildlife rehabilitator to ask for advice about this if not i would highly recommend looking up one in your region next time
apparently i can t edit this post his mother never left the area and collected him after minutes of him wandering around the area it s a small chunk of woods in a city so it was easy to keep an eye out it s the internet so i expected people to be outraged because people have to be angry about something every day it seems the deer is fine
you look just like a guest artist at temple tattoo in ohio that we were just in today we were so worried we missed a deer but we double checked their social media pages and they didn t post anything about a deer visit
i learned that at an outdoor retreat trip when i was young at school they showed me a stuffed doe just like that because someone saw it in the wild and pet it
first congrats for being the first deer to open a tattoo shop second how do you hold your gun with hooves when you let him go did he run off sometimes they just stand there after you‚Äôve let them touch you avoid them if you can
dude you totally look like a guy i know same glasses and tattoos
get a tattoo of the deer on your rear because it rhymes
friendly psa wild animals contain a lot of disgusting parasites namely ticks and that beautiful beard looks like a wonderful habitat for any one of them fuck ticks seriously if you happen to get a bullseye rash make sure you see a doctor immediately
dude people used to not sit next to me on a bart train because i was wearing a leather jacket it brings me great joy seeing those in the counterculture being wholesome take that snobs
what an adorable baby i hope you gave him some food deer are like beagles they eat nonstop
depending on if you re in the u s and what region you might have a prion disease you re welcome
bambi came to get the ‚Äúmom‚Äù in a heart tattooed rip
that s great he s back in the woods now what happened to the deer
you may wanna check yourself for ticks and get tested for lyme disease
if someone doesn t have this as a portrait by the end of the week then your shop needs to realign their priorities
don t pick it up and bring it inside and take a selfie with it just leave it alone poor thing
you re not supposed to touch them the mommy bird won t let them back in the nest
he just wanted to get a human head tattoo on his bicep
good thing you did i don t think he s old enough for a tattoo
then he wanted a thumper tattoo and you sent him home to mama and said come back with a guardian
one thing is a bit dangerous once you touh a baby doe the parents will smell humans on it and abandod it in school they always tought us not to touch baby wild animals due to this fact
damn you have balls putting your face on a wild deer like that haha
i‚Äôll be able to tell which one he is in the woods from the ‚Äúi lt remington‚Äù tattoo on his butt
only thing you got to worry about is the deer bringing their friends for family portraits then it ll be the foxes wolves buffalo elephants yeah might be limited chance but if you believe all the stories on here you re in for some exotic tropical disease transmitted only by the outer mongolian wombat during the months of june to september
the sad truth is he s probably safer at the store the chance of him being hunted by predators in the wood is far higher but it s nature
i honestly thought this was a syrian hamster before i read the title
how many black possums did you have to breed to get a gold one
karen what the actual heck do you think my life is a joke
isn t more cute that you have those mini steps for your dog
i like the quotation marks op owning that repost huh
at least he didn‚Äôt find those steps out in the woods
susan move the stairs back now so i may plop of the couch
i had the opposite happen dogg got onto the bed via jumping from stairs to bed then couldn t get back down the same way because of the narrow landing strip on the misplaced stairs came home to frantic barking in the bedroom
those stairs look squishy and soft they look like a comfy alternative to the couch
the original may have been deleted but this is still a repost

i have a big grey bearcat the same he is super clumsy and goofy but the cuddliest puss going loves snuggles and if i make a kissing noise he rubs my face and snuggles under my chin i feel blessed that my cats have so much love to give and feel so comfortable in my company we really are the closest thing to family to them and really their whole life
so story time yesterday im laying outside and enjoying some relaxation my cat comes up and lays on my chest he snuggles up to my face im trying to teach him not to lay on my neck basically and he keeps doing it each time i half pick up push the cat off my neck then he starts moving back up slowly nuzzling my neck at first i was like im done petting you so while im laying there ignoring the cat on my chest he bites me the cat grabs a mouthful of skin and digs his teeth into me blood is coming flowing down my cheek and my neck and all i can think is i should have never have let it get this far stupid cat i cant win he gets aggressive when you pet him too much he gets agressive when you stop petting him
my cat started climbing me and hugging me i take it it s because i started giving him scraps of tuna and chicken
my little black panther pepper was a cuddler like that too miss her every day you are blessed
get close to me don t touch my ears but get close to me
reminds me of mine every morning she lies on my chest and demands i lie down so she can when i get home from work bombays are the cutest
with a beautiful girl like you i also would be cuddling all day long
does he she drool on you my cat does this and he becomes a sprinkler
awww she s like my parent s old man cat murray they got the cats because murray gives hugs like that
it s a black cat thing mine must be curled up in the curve of my neck with his head under my chin anytime i lay down
every cat i‚Äôve ever had has loved to cuddle like that never understood the ‚Äúaloof cat‚Äù stereotype because i‚Äôve never had anything but cuddlebugs myself
black cats are the best mine goes on walks with me and he bullies people who are walking their dogs he s the shit
cuddly cats are the best my current cat is the cuddliest of all five cats i ever had and he s the best
i love that especially when the purring is in turbo mode amp x b makes me feel all warm and fuzzy
i have a black cat as well he loves to cuddle with me won t with anyone else if i even begin to approach him he starts to purr headbutts every time i walk past meows if i accidentally don t see him as i walk past and jumps up on anything high if i am walking towards it to be picked up and cuddled he loves to nestle his head against my chin
does the cat have a scar or is that just the lighting
that is adorable but i have two at my side right now that adore me and love to cuddle and cant stand to be away from me the are in the driveway when i get home even the shower they wait until im done but they love to lick the water off my legs i love these guys so much i am so happy for you and your bud as well

he looks like he‚Äôs about to tell me the saddest story about his service in the great war
remember when damn near everyone had a giraffe as a profile pic on facebook
prepare for countless hours of constant screaming its worth it though bengals are a lot of fun
the head and front paws look bigger than the rest of it very cute
this is bengalcat bear on instagram for anyone curious
ohmygod this is the most adorable thing i have ever seen
many kittens do not look much like the cats they will become the bengal kitten is like the imago stage in insects small in scale but fully mature in appearance
there is a cat that looks like this at a smoke shop i go to thing has some huge balls must ve paid a fortune for that cat hard to believe they let it walk around when anyone could take it
it looks like a full grown cat with a really big head
no lie roommate had one of these cats and she was a monster stared me strait in the eyes while she pissed on my couch hated that cat she was really pretty though so there‚Äôs that
i own that exact set of garden furniture cool cat too i guess
they should come with a set of earplugs i read they were vocal before i got them but man they‚Äôre loud when they want something i have two and if i‚Äôm mins late feeding them i know about it if they are indoor cats then get scratching posts and plenty of toys outs have a cat wheel and love it if you don‚Äôt tire them out they can get destructive mine have grown out of it now they‚Äôre but they could be a pain in the ass as kittens üòÇ wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way though great cats with loads of personality
cute but i sense that it might be a complete spaz which is fun
makes you wonder how exactly did a cheetah fuck a cat
me sees this also me how much do bengal kittens cost
gorgeous little devil üòÇ i have two of them coolest cats i‚Äôve ever owned they own us we don‚Äôt own them
my bengal was free also we got her when she was weeeks from a rescue
it‚Äôs important to have salad to get your necessary ruffage
my uncle used to have a german shepherd called zeebo
hi zambo who s a good boi of course it s you smartest doggie in da world
that donkey is like i don t know why you are doing what you are doing but i like it
does anyone else think that kitty looks kinda freaky slenderpuss proportions lmao
i can translate put your right foot in take your left foot out put your right foot in and you shake it all about huh looks like a bunch of hokee pokee it me
we have an owl that hangs out on our roof i‚Äôm pretty sure he is doing this all night but he does keep the pigeons away so who needs a quiet roof i guess
to the right to the right to the right to the left to the left to the left
"and then and then i ll get them like this rawwwww
no no momma said that we have to be silent like the night so maybe if i jump on them like this i can catch them"
i‚Äôd give her a ha and a hi ya and a woo ahhh and then i kick her sir
"‚Äú what are you doing ‚Äù
‚Äúpouncing ‚Äù
‚Äúlet an old pro show you how it‚Äôs done ‚Äú"
the flash of light when the gif reset and him standing looking straight at the camera freaked me out for a second very cute practice makes perfect
i‚Äôm those little tippy taps remind me of a little kid who didn‚Äôt get his her way
practicing pounce skills looking at shit on the wood wondering if he kill interact with it
‚Äúand then i‚Äôll get him just like this pow he won‚Äôt know what hit him ‚Äù
oh s he is clearly dancing op doesn t believe owls have dance troops
wow this is incredibly sweet to witness that kitty is a real love
only problem is it is slowed down and reversed i bet if played at original speed and the right direction it would look a lot more like the cat batting the bird and the bird trying to bite the cat paw
the cat s expression is not one of love that for sure he s craving some fresh bird for his next meal
that is too precious notice that he doesn t use his claws
stole a perfectly good medium size gecko milkshake from mr spider
what a nice person to save that little lizard he s so cute
i m just picturing a little spider shaking its fists at you in anger squeaking obscenities
he thinks he is your friend you monster you are his best friend and he is yours
he was just trying to sell web insurance to the spider
he‚Äôs so small imagine being carefully saved by a giant over ten thousand times more massive than you who could casually crush you but saw you‚Äôre plight and stopped to help you did a good thing and he wants to hang out now
apologies in advance but i can t resist saying it amp x b was the spider web you rescued him from on the back of your hand
a lizard fighting a spider reminds me of a painfully average reboot of a famous superhero i don t remember the name though
are those spider webs under your hand in the nd pic or it s just hair
vertebrates got to stick together there s more of them then there are us
give him some water and release him back to the wild he s too small for you to feed properly one day in a time desperate need he will be there for you
i m concerned that you live with spiders that are big enough to trap a fucking reptile in their web
all right let s get those bad puns started who will be the first to take a quack at it
aflac is all i have im my head forgive my media exposure
pretty cool but will that duck make my pp grow inch we need answers
the duck is probably stressed out and is going to remember the person who did this and one day when the person is not expecting it it ll happen it wont be pretty it ll hurt a lot but it ll have to happen because ducks remember and ducks never forget
i very much needed a duck on a swing today thank you
thanks first woke up to k karma and now i see a duck on a swing
yes i needed this just came from the lawyer post and thread no i m not going to explain thank you for posting
i m listening to music and the duck song came on just when this post popped up
this is one of the things that a man doesn t know he needs until he is given such
i hope op cleans that swing afterwards birds are notoriously difficult to toilet train
he a good happy boi who emits energy from his feet that gives on happy magic vibes
my moods live on that swing same push me harder push me push me swang into tomorrow
if i m in a bad mood later i m gonna look at this again and feel better
i thought i was having flashbacks from the white blotter acid i did in
would have never thought this was what i needed today
so if you needed to see this today does that make this a mood swinging duck
does anyone have a case of sancerre on a swing that would cheer me up duck in seeing didn t help
i hate this because she is obviously uncomfortable and trying to fly out it‚Äôs cute but not nice for the duck‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è
i didn‚Äôt know i needed this but now i have it and im happy
you wake up in a sweat at am and find this good boii over you givin you a sniff what you do

that face when you tell a funny joke at lunch and your whole table laughs
aww we had a black lab named onyx years ago precious new baby you have there
is he a pure bred or is he part boxer cause he looks a lot like my boxador puppy used to

what a gorgeous smooth coat i d never stop petting him also photography skills posing skills for onyx
my st dog was a black german shepard labrador named onyx amp x b i miss onyx only other color was a white patch on her chest
initiate play dead subroutine and maybe i won t get in trouble
i didn‚Äôt know robots could get pissed thats advanced shit

mine s been doing similar got cat trees set up next to the window and with the weather being nice i ve had the window open the one cat will park her fat arse on the platform while having her front paws on the window sill to stare out the screen
evolution going too far what next cats playing piano
she has maximum tummy to sun exposure going on my cat would approve
you reach a certain milestone in your life once you accept the fact that at some point in time your pets butthole will touch every inch of your house and everything and everyone in it accept it
wow your cat looks exactly like my kitten that was like seeing my cat in the furture he sits weirdly like that all the time haha
because he has no other place to nicely lay or sit on you should get him something wide enough for him to lounge on
i love that cats seem so observant always looking around keeping an eye on things
so funny cats can do the most strange things and this is coming from the owner of a yr old pussycat
‚Äúputtin mah asshole right on your bed‚Äù says cat probably
this cat s human likes to zoom their camera a little strangely
my mother s friend had a jack russell that would hook its front two legs over the back of an armchair and let its body just dangle and apparently it would stay like this for ages
that board is gonna have a whole lot of starfish paintings on top
just like my cat üòÇ i thought it was somekind of brain problem good to know its not alone
lol my cat too sometimes she ll like lay over the arm of the couch and only put paw down like she s in a frozen state lol she s a goof love her lt

yessss i thought i was going be stuck with these turkeys as my friends

those elder turkeys are planning how they are going to rule the world btw
the brown one looks so much like a deer with those big doe eyes
so cute they kinda remind me of toddlers meeting for the first time
whoever filmed this did a fantastic job this was no armature
i thought dogs are supposed to sniff each other s buttholes
repost was here on this sub once but ill let it slide because the cows are cute
i can see what‚Äôs happening what and they don‚Äôt have a clue moo
might be a stupid question but if humans didn t interfere with their growth would cows maintain these dimensions ie would they be more spritely like their babes
sadly their last moments will be together at the jbs plant
and a friendship was born amp x b and yes cows have best friends and get very sad and depressed when separated which happens a lot because humans are scum
what sweet creatures too bad people stick them in miserable places for their whole lives and then kill them
is this a disney movie because it looks like it should be a disney movie
i need a cute comic between these two calves being best friends right now

whenever i see stuff like this it makes me sad to wonder what the future holds for these babies
i do like cardinals i m not a remotely superstitious type however a coworker of mine stated that her grandmother claimed cardinals are the incarnations of the spirits of passed away family and friends checking up on you
i can count cardinals at my feeders right now they keep on bringing their babies to feed every year
stop taking photos of birds if they just blow up that‚Äôs cruel
what if the actual bird exploded and op is some sort sadistic bird murderer
i have a light outside of my apartment that doesn t work and hasn t since i ve moved in and birds sometimes make nests in it this year we had a cardinal make a nest it was pretty neat during the day the female stayed behind with the egg baby and then the male would come back around late afternoon evening i haven t seen them in a few days so i m assuming the youngin was old enough to leave and they left i never realized that the male cardinals were the brightly colored ones and the females have red but are like a gray brown
yeah didn‚Äôt everyone tell you it probably flew into a windows and you should stop bothering touching it
so u found cdpr mascot i didn t know they have lost it
looks like the screaming bird from the swamp of the last airbender
cardinal birds are my favorite birds also st louis and louisville
they look like they re both expecting you to bring them drinks with little umbrellas in it
both are waiting for their diet because they are in the fence or cage and can t hunter with their own consent
you mean service dog therapy dog has a different purpose
legitimate question what kind of therapy is this dog suppose to be providing is the eye covering that she‚Äôs doing supposed to be something someone whose having an panic attack would do and would having a dog jump on you somehow prevent that attack who exactly is this supposed to help
peanut butter works well for positive reinforcement
irish setters are the purest beauty that ever walked on four legs upon this earth
he‚Äôs so happy to serve and watching this makes me happy
service dog therapy dogs help more than one person service dogs are trained to only help one person their disabled handler therapy dogs are usually found in places like hospitals nursing homes libraries and schools
omg he is the best boy and he deserves all the pets
good to see kristen bell changing career to something that satisfies more people
i know she s training the dog and is most likely a fan of dogs but the look on her face when she drops that purse just screams here pick this up you dipshit dog to me and i find it hilarious
why are you in a wheelchair i can clearly see your not crippled
what can i say labs are freaking the best dog breed ever found by man
when instamodels turn the filters up a little too high
take out the papers and the trash or you don t get no spendin cash
beautiful but animals are not props this isn‚Äôt right
all i can think of is ace ventura yyyyaaaaakkkkkk yyyaaak yeeeeaaak
me so what s happening here yak dude i don t even know any more
i hope it is fed well and gets enough of water but honestly this is so sad leave these beautiful creatures alone find another way to make money
wish that girl would get her butt off that animal it s not a chair
poor sweetheart such a lucky pup to have good hoomans looking after her ‚ù§Ô∏è
yeah rescue i guess she got hit agency said they tried to save the leg i think she‚Äôs just glad to not have that cone on they caught her licking yesterday so far she hasn‚Äôt been too bad once or twice she always stops if i correct her a goodest girl

disabled doggos are awesome give him some extra pets for me
beautiful girl looks like she s healing nicely so happy you found each other
there s an inflatable style cone that looks like a donut i ve seen photos of dogs comfortably sleeping with them on but i m so glad she s found her loving home with a human who loves her
congrats be sure to explore the wonders of string together
get a load of those huge bear paws he‚Äôs gunna be a big beastie when he grows up d
is it microchipped it could be someone s cat already
soooo we just gonna ignore the whole my girlfriend almost hit something with her car part
great thing that she missed it congrats on your new kitty üòª
meanwhile there s a child balling their eyes out because some strange man claimed their kitten
looks very young it might be a good idea to search the area in case there s a litter as well as alert your local rescue organization
tfw cats name is your family name hey hope you two have a good experience with the fluff ball
my girlfriend almost murdered this dude today so we own it now
check if it s someones pet first you might ve just stole someones kitten off the street
you think it s cute it kill my whole family with it s black hole eyes
i like how aww is how you spell both the cute sound and the disappointment sound gt my girlfriend almost hit something with her car meet our new kitten harper aww she looks so sweet and fluffy lt gt my girlfriend almost hit something with her car meet our new kitten harper aww she ll get her next time
so you guys just stole a cat is that what you re trying to say
cute cat for those talking about stealing a cat or whatever nonsense if it belongs to someone else they should have taken better care of it or it wouldn t have been in the situation where a car could have run over it and if it doesn t belong to anyone even better that you adopted harper
awwwww that looks like a kitten version of my sweet y o cat you‚Äôve been blessed by the gray fuzz but i‚Äôm not biased at all
ok but i want to know what the something is this cat is distracting me from the scene of the crime
our cat earl grey looked exactly like this as a kitten he‚Äôs now a beautiful majestic year old jerk face
when i was about i watched my sweet fluffy grey boy get hit by a car in front of my house i m so happy your girlfriend didn t hit this sweet little floof
more conclusive proof that the universe chooses your cat for you
and once again the saying that you never look for a cat one looks for you rings true
she still looks bewildered by the whole ordeal haha poor lil baby
i d like to imagine those two thoughts are completely unrelated and op just got distracted halfway through posting
my friend and i were in a little fender bender one day a kitten was the reward found in the ditch near by where we pulled over to exchange insurance cards using their unique and slightly dangerous powers of the universe they chose you
harper gusset cute little thing and i m not being punny
take good care of this sweetie harper remember you are blessed by her presence i love this name
already a troublemaker and too cute best be prepared for daughters in your future it s an omen
she‚Äôs so cute omg praise jebus she didn‚Äôt hit her plz update us with growth pics
imagine if it got hit she would probably still be cute
congrats you got the greatest breed of cat nebelung
that looks like a nebelung a medium hair russian blue is it a boy or girl if it‚Äôs a girl can you get her fixed before months can you go back to the place where you found the kitty and see if there are others thanks for helping this pretty baby ‚ù§Ô∏è
you can t distract us from the fact that your girlfriend nearly hit something with pictures of your kitten
beautiful cat please make sure it‚Äôs not chipped though could very well be someone else‚Äôs cat too many people find dogs cats on the street and don‚Äôt even bother to try and find the owner and just keep it not trying to rain on the parade do the right thing though and at the very least make sure it‚Äôs not lost
thanks for naming your cat after my daughter my harper also loves kittys give it a good scratch for her
that‚Äôs the name of the first kitten i ever rescued too
looks like it s still seeing it s life flash before it s eyes congrats on the new fur baby though
my friend just found a kitten that looks like that too in florida hiding in a car
sure it is a stray and you can just keep it don t want to be the bad one here but maybe some one is missing their kitten now
you almost hit me with the car inferior humans take me to your home and compensate my emotional pain k
really surprised that all the comments aren t about the dude s crotch i thought i knew the internet
you found a nebelung fairly rare breed very beautiful
listen just because you hit the owner doesn‚Äôt make it your cat jk cutest kitten ever
harper is going to be gorgeous in a year so silvery blue
stop stealing pets stop encouraging people to steal pets if you find a lone animal you try and find its owner you don t declare it yours
even if it may not be someone s cat it might have a mother cat that went off to find food
we once lost a kitten like this strangers saw her on the road and just picked her up and drove off we never had a chance to follow them or add a chip farm area so cats don t wear collars i hope you will ask around the neighborhood and check for some family who is missing their cat because of this our little kitten has lost her sister for ever
i see it s still in the what is going on help stage
any movie that steven segal is the star actor is going to be a piece of crap
should have named it rick from the walking dead he never dies
it looks about weeks old and doesn t seem to be afraid of people even if it isn t microchipped yet that could very well be someone s pet
i like her style i want to adopt an animal i almost ran over today not sure how the hubs would feel about me bringing home a full grown deer though
you know what really grinds my gears people who think that cats that don t have a leash are up for grabs that s just me tho
whatever happened to leaving baby animals near where you found them so that their mothers can find them
awwwwww little guy gal those beady eyes awwwwwwwwww my heart
hey my wife is asking if you live in the houston area because she is interested in loving your cat which i believe is female for ‚Äúcuddling‚Äù with your cat
that has got to be one of the cutest kittens i ve ever seen
this kitten doesn t really look like a stray it could have escaped from someone s home it looks too young to get chipped someone might be searching for it lucky it wasn t hit by a car though
that kitten definitely contains the soul of a dead victorian child
somewhere out there in the vast expanse of the earth someone is still looking for their runaway kitten
is this way later than when you first found the kitten i saved a street kitten last year and she was absolutely filthy and full of worms not to mention i had to lure her with food to catch her this looks like a fucking show cat compared to her
personally i would have gone with lucky but anyways congratulations on the new furry friend
well the look in her eyes tells me she indeed almost got run over by a car
that cat looks like it is still trying to figure out whether it actually did get hit and went to cat heaven or not
yeah maybe ask around first might belong to someone already
lol i ve fostered lots of stray kittens and worked at shelters and that doesn t look like a stray i ve ever seen hope you can look for a possible owner or mamma if it was my kitty and cats are talented darting artists i would be heartbroken
just by looking at it i think its a ragdoll fantastic companions good for you guys
congrats on stealing a cat and posting on reddit there is no way a cat looking as healthy as that is a stray people who do this for reddit likes are fucking scum
i always wonder how so many kittens are just randomly found roaming around
this looks like a persian breed so it‚Äôs likely someone does already own it please make the effort to return it to it‚Äôs owner
lol at now everyone makes the assumption that because this cat is a cute floof it can‚Äôt possibly be a feral kitten
my intial thoughts were why did you reward her for almost hitting something
these posts always make me really nervous my cats can go inside and outside whenever they want they don t have a collar because they usually don t go far and always come back also because they don t like collars and we live next to a dense forest and they might get stuck i m scared someone is gonna yoink one of my cats this way i m really really opposed to just plucking your pets off the street
wow she s a tiny little furball much karma to your girlfriend for saving this small kitten s life
lots of people on reddit stealing cats and dogs they encounter in the street
it looks like it knows it s a hostage by some weird non furry animals now
it looks brain damaged almost as if someone hit it with a car hmmm
this is so fuckng smart this name it reminds me of harper of cod black ops campaign
really hoping your post title is a grab for karma and you didn t actually steal somebody s cat you know damn well a cat like that isn t a stray she on you
well i hope you didn t just pick her up and took her home because there is a high chance that you just stole someone else s cat
that s an adorable and beautiful kitty happy for you guys
where was your girlfriend at when she almost hit the kitten
is this how it works you almost hit an animal with your vehicle boom the animal is all yours cool
when i found my stray i was told you have to spend weeks actively looking for an owner before you can adopt check for a chip put up posters no photo just date and location found and contact info and put profiles on a few lost pet sites
really hoping your post title is a grab for karma and you didn t actually steal somebody s kitten you know damn well a cat like that isn t a stray that s an expensive pure bred cat somebody bought you don t just find cats like that who belong to nobody someone out there is devastated and doesn t know they are never going to get their kitten back and always wonder if it made it or died outside in some awful way shame on you especially for not even making any attempt to look and just thinking about yourselves
i hate posts like this i mean you probably just stole a cat
so great btw harper might not have totally forgotten your sister
how do you know this kitten doesn t have a family already it looks too sleek to be a ferral cat
why did she try to hit your kitty with her car i think she s more of a dog person
please ask around if it belongs to someone do not just take it home with you you may be happy you got a new cat but the previous owners surely will not
we went and bought a new kitten then made some shit up about a car karma karma nom nom nom
looks a lot like my baby gus the eyes will change colour
her life would have been in danger without that ‚Äúalmost‚Äù
i would have gone with finnegan freiburger or roadkill
sure there isnt some poor kid out looking for his kitten
that little face looks like its saying thanks for not killing me
honestly this kitten doesn t look like a stray to me op you have the best intentions but please look out if there s an owner of this kitten somewhere
if your grey cat is like mine very loving to whom she he bonds other people though not so much enjoy the journey
why do people think that if they find a cat they‚Äôre entitled to take it cats are known to explore quite a wide area from their homes sometimes being gone for days at a time this looks healthy and well fed i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a stray
ever think these people who just take home random kittens picked up someone elses kitten who just ran away without saying to the police i found this cat if anyone is looking for one just curious
it was a gamble for sure jumping in front of that car but it worked out for her
cute kitten but what did she almost hit with her car
that old community staple see an animal steal an animal
public service announcement guy don‚Äôt forget to take harper to get checked out at the vet
you fool you never bring in a cat off the street they got the most diseases and now she‚Äôs going to bring home everything she finds
you know damn well a cat like that isn t a stray that s an expensive pure bred cat somebody bought you don t just find cats like that who belong to nobody someone out there is devastated and doesn t know they are never going to get their kitten back and will always wonder if it made it or died outside in some awful way shame on you especially for not even making any attempt to look and just thinking about yourselves
she looks like she s still reliving almost getting hit by a car every second üòÇ
hey people who call op a thief i can t understand the owner who decided to let their kitty out and risk them being hit by a car should be the one to go look for their kitty and knock on doors if necessary harper could ve been dead if op s gf didn t pick him up he could ve been hit by another car or something if op could spare the time of knocking on doors the owner who wishes to find his kitty definitely could i mean letting your helpless kitty out even without a collar when there are cars nearby and then screaming for thievery when some decent person picks him on the road before he dies what a sensible thing to do
she totally picked it up from the pet store and made up the i almost made it into roadkill story
wait that looks like my cat lmao my cat name is called snubbles he ran away more than days ago if that really is my cat you can have him i think youll be a better owner than me
make sure she isnt chipped may be someone elses kitten
what a cute little nebulong if she s anything like mine she ll be the most loyal and loving companion to one person and hate everyone else lol
that looks like a nebulong which is a rather rare and fancy breed it is wonderful you saved her from the road however it is very very unlikely that this is a stray
this i hate it when i see clipped ears odin looks adorable
clipped ears is some fucked tradition for show dogs whoever thought mutilating a dog‚Äôs ears and tail was a ‚Äústandard‚Äù need to get clipped
this is my baby he s currently coming next to mommy
he looks like he can hear the international space station
snipping off dog bits for cosmetics is pretty messed up i left my rotties tail on it s a beast of a tail but i wouldn t have him any other way
hey it s what a pibble is actually supposed to look like
i had no idea unclipped ears were this big on a pitty i dont know how anyone could look at this face and think clipping off a few parts looks better
i‚Äôve actually never seen their ears in natural state thanks
oh wow odin‚Äôs coat face amp eyes are all cute too what a pretty boy such a sweet face
sweet pup his expression is saying ‚Äúyou want to talk about it ‚Äù
those ears are so expressive i wish everyone was against ear clipping and tail docking
i ve never seen a pit bull without clipped ears before i didn t even know they did that how horrible the only reason to do that is if the dog is going to be fighting and you shouldn t be raising your dog to fight
does he like ice i had a rednose when i was a child and a blue as an adult both loved ice cubes
right on my boy would always come running when i had drank enough liquid for the ice cubes to make noise in my glass he would wait patiently haha
what a handsome allfather love those floppy ears clipped ears are cruel
i have a serious weakness for freckled puppers he s adorable
that s my baby boy as you can see my profile pic i m his momma ü§ó so handsome like his dad
cosmetic mutilation can fuck right off who would look at this good pupper s majestic ears and think oh yeah we best slice those off also dude looks so serious like he s tryna internalise a really complicated situation in his head
i live in a country where coupure or clipping is illegal so no comments from me i wouldn t want someone taking parts of me for show so why for a dog or cat good job kiddo
i totally agree with you about the eara odin looks great
i‚Äôve never seen a pittie with unclipped ears that stick up like that üòç
aww i remember when my max‚Äôs ears used to do that before the ear infections he had these bubbles in his ears and after we had to get them popped his ears just feel like cauliflower now
floppy ears are the best ears for the sweet puppers
dog has too many eyes and not enough spears to be odin
wrong that look is badass but the tradeoff is mutilation and that s sad but fuck it i m a bad person and i d be able to eat sleep and fuck after making the decision no problem
ear and tail docking have been illegal in australia for years he s adorable just the way he is
why would anyone snip those beautiful ears he looks so adorable i don t think i ve seen a full grown pitty with unclipped ears and i love it odin is beautiful it should be illegal to clip ears
the only bits that you should cut off of dogs are the bits because there s too many shelter dogs in the world and they want a home
unclipped pitty ears are the fucking best it makes me so angry to see how closely assholes crop their dogs ears
gt pitbull enjoy your face while you still have it lad
why would you mutilate someone like this i m glad i never heard of clipped ears in my country
my rescue is a lab pit mix and she has unclipped ears
lol what a stupid attention seeking comment not a single person in this subreddit would tell you to get that dogs ears clipped
i was under the impression just about everywhere banned clipping and docking years back who gets a dog and thinks ‚Äúdamn you know what if i cut this mofo up a bit it‚Äôs gunna look awesome ‚Äù
i have a pupper called odin too he s a yorkie thoughüòÅ
i love the name odin for a dog but would be concerned people would think i was a white supremacist if i was shouting it across a park maybe only applies in finland
i agree about the wars ps one of my cats is named thor because both he and the mythological thor are gingers üôÇ
i‚Äôm always up for people who don‚Äôt mutilate their dogs call me crazy
you re not wrong but fuck these comments are cringey
personally i feel like clipped ears and clipped tails make dogs like pit bulls and rottweilers and doberman way more menacing and mean looking like a pit bull without its ears and tail clipped looks like a really nice dog but personally i think it looks better but i‚Äôm not sure if i would clip it i mean clipping isn‚Äôt even that bad though if you think about it your not causing the dog any pain or disadvantage they don‚Äôt suffer or anything so i don‚Äôt get the big deal
floppy ears give me the happies if you train your dog to accept people touching their ears stroking them can be the most soothing feeling
all bits of all the doggos is good neutering at least serves a point
who on reddit did you think would come at you for not cropping ears
anyone who s you for keeping an anatomically correct body part on your animal can fuck the fuck off odin is one handsome boy what a damn cutie pie
while i m not a huge fan of pits i am a fan of your choice just because it s historically applicable does not mean it s good or right thankyou
my pitt has her tail and ears they look a millions times better with them
my boy s name is odin too your odin is a cutie patootie üòç
i just got a pitbull and had no idea about ear clipping for them until this post that s just awful love a good big eared pittie
omg he looks exactly like kevin pup on instagram i‚Äôve never seen another pitt with ears that stood up like that they could be brothers
old dogs are the best great painting too i like the style
she‚Äôs so pretty looks just like my betty how old is your girl
this is such a beautiful painting my mom did the paint your dog thing too and i thought it turned out good but yours is so so so good üòçüòç
she is such a beautiful doggy what kind of dog is she she‚Äôs the spitting image of my best friend d also your artwork is fantastic you really captured her little mischievous eyes xd
ooo i love ron burns style paintings i ve done two myself and they were really fun
damn that s amazing was it an advanced course my dog would have been ashamed of the black blob on canvas that i would have brought home
she is so proud of her beautiful portrait awesome girl love her and love the painting great job you really captured her smile wonderfully
she looks like my dog who died before last christmas üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è
your real dog looks happy your painted dog looks verrrrrry leery about the real dog ha ha
dude that looks so good and black pets are so hard to paint you did an amazing job doggo and i are very proud
omg what a sweet baby this warms my horrible angry heart hole more than you know
smiling because of the treat she is about to get but nice work on the portrait
that s such a beautiful painting damn good job i can t decide if i like the painting or your doggo more but then again why not both your girl is precious please give her all the love and treats she deserves
you totally captured her she is so sweet give her a snuggle for me
what‚Äôs more impressive than your own artistic talent is that you could have painted your dog as a cat and it still would‚Äôve appreciated you equally for your effort we don‚Äôt deserve dogs and i‚Äôm not sure why they love us so
she looks proud of you not matter what aw what a cutie
your pup looks like she could be my pup‚Äôs twin right down to the same amount of grey is she pure lab or a mix
wow do you have any previous painting experience or are you just a complete goddamn natural at painting because that looks amazing
i love this are you an artist i am not and i want to paint my late dog too was it easy for you
oh wow wonderful job beautiful dog and beautiful painting
i always wonder if animals recognize images like these either way beautiful creature
did you just have to put my missing teeth in the painting
omg i love everything about this i want to paint my dog where did you take a class
that s a class piece of art it s brilliant you captured her spirit beautifully
looks great good job is it oil or acrylic something tells me that it had been painted with oil
wow she looks almost identical to my sweet girl lucky ‚ô•Ô∏è
tell her my super handsome black lab now has the hots for her
i think she is just happy to be with you dogs are wonderful
she‚Äôs thinking uhh you forgot my bling but it‚Äôs ok great painting
black labs often don‚Äôt photograph well but they clearly show up in paint beautifully love this
thanks for sharing your talent and your beautiful subject love it
what was the most useful thing you learned about painting pets in that class i recently lost my dog and i‚Äôd love to paint him but would hate to butcher his face haha
okay so that is not the neck of the dog it is actually the dogs back and the dog is looking up at the ‚Äúcamera‚Äù just thought this would help
if im being honest thought you were trying to spell like not lacks lol then i thought it over
he looks like a th grader at a dance when they start to play the slow songs
don‚Äôt do that a pet s coat is designed by nature to keep it cool during the summer and warm in the winter by shaving your pet you usually interfere with this built in temperature regulation cats in particular are very good at regulating body temperature and really get no benefit from being shaved says mark j stickney dvm clinical associate professor and director of general surgery services at texas a amp m university s veterinary medical teaching hospital
it just has an oh god i m exposed dont look demenor to it
don t laugh at him too much an ex girlfriend did this to her cat i laughed and laughed from then on the cat hated me and pissed on my stuff whenever possible they know you re laughing at them and they re sensitive about it
puppy ‚Äúhey what‚Äôs all the commotion back there ‚Äù tail wagwagwagwagwahsahsahsgagsgs
this puppy has attained a whole new level of happiness
well it s a known fact that tails have a mind of their own
i‚Äôve only watched this puppy gif for seconds but i already know if anything happened to this little guy i would kill everyone in this post and then myself
omg you got a gremlin amp x b put it in water and see how fast it can go
me when i m trying to sleep but drank coffee too late in the day
i nearly dropped my phone on my face in sheer overwhelming amount of cuteness
i m saving this for every moment in life when i m not smiling
hi i ll take three of those please and make sure they re extra waggy thanks
what the hell kind of problem does this dog have that ain t just happy wags
dont let the puppy at the lake that tail would propel it across it in seconds
i don t don t know what s cutter if him or his tail
why does it s face remind me of the sonic movie trailer
it s cute but someday his tail gonna burst it happened to one of my dogs her tail would always be going non stop she s just super happy and excitable but one day it burst from wagging too much and sent blood all over the damn room
if that puppy‚Äôs tail accelerates to wpm he‚Äôs going to time jump and leave a space time rift we really don‚Äôt want that to happen the consequences could be severe
basically men when i get home from work an jump onto my bed
this is more cute than kitties trying to get inside in the same shoe
i want a dog so much üòç but know it‚Äôs gonna be years until i can have one
i think its so funny that dogs and cats cant control their tails it just happens with emotions
that s a very early onset case of wigglebutts looks serious
nnyyyyuyyuuyyyyunn nnnbnn n nn n nnnnnmn nn nnn nnnnnnyuyyuyuyyyyyyyyyuyyuyyyuyyyyyyyyuyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
i think dogs frequently forget their own tails exist tbh
this is the one that chases you down the street and doesn t know why
was he hiding under something cause then he would be fromunda cheese
and he allowed you belly scratches i‚Äôm jealous it‚Äôs always a trap when my cat lets me pet his tummyüòÇüòÇ
my friend had a cat that looked exactly like that also named cheese he passed away about a decade ago so it‚Äôs very heartwarming to see this
oh my goodness my cat s name is cheese too although she doesn t look like cheese she s very brown
i guess forcing will have the opposite effect you gave him space which is why he feels he can trust you
he looks exactly like my kitty i won‚Äôt be seeing him all summer and watching this makes me happy
looks like colby jack of you want to get technical xd
this shit is going to get delightfully out of control
i love his name we have an orange tabby named cider his eyes are apple cider brown üòä
i have a feeling he would get along with my cat sargento very gouda
he did transition into full on writhing hedonism mode though so looks like it worked outüòÇ srsly had a cat for years and he never let me pet him for more than a few seconds and only when he was on his way to something like it was more of a pit stop p
need to force em pets on the cat when they are new to the home
my ex has an extremely grumpy ginger cat named nacho and getting to hang out with him was one of the best parts about that relationship
wow belly rubs too that is usually a cat clamp tramp nice
belly rubs without getting scratched in the first pet im jealous of you
it‚Äôs weird how some cats do this completely hide for a while with absolute fear then one day rub my belly
i feel like a cotton ball with eyes is way less responsibility
i had a himalayan blue point like this one and they were just the most adorable cats ever
so cute i had almost the exact same kitty when i was a kid she has the worst tangling problem though gotta brush and brush and brush those little ones
looks like a colourpoint ragdoll kitten definitely a ragdoll awesome cats
can someone please photoshop steve buschemi onto this kitten for me
aww it looks like it s already telling me to get off its lawn
my gran had a cat like this called pippin he was the cutest call of fluff
how is this kitten somehow old and a baby and the same time
it s funny when kittens eyes don t agree on a direction
i don t know why that cat is so sad but please do something
okay i need to go to bed i swear i saw this image come to life and move while staring at it
i feel like i see an old man or an old professor your brother s cotton ball is adorable
reminds of that monster from where the wild things are a cutie
maybe it s just an odd camera angle but could that be the next grumpy cat
it looks like a mini appa avatar last air bender lol
what is going on with the person laying down in the background it looks like they are laying on their stomach qith their butt up but then their feet are turned ¬∞ around also cute kitten
looks like one of those cats from medieval paintings i love him
that kitty is gonna be so ugly cute and i m üíØ here for it
he looks like he was reincarnated as a cat from someone that witnessed the holocaust but the memories followed him into his new cat life
is it just me or does he look like tyrion lannister
what an adorable floof is that a purple plexi dildo on the background
holy fuck holy fuck holy fuck it looks like young grumpycat he s been reborn
s he looks like a cotton ball that was just brought to life by some magic s he can t understand and is still puzzled
i haven t adopted a cat in a while doesnt that kitten look about two or three weeks too young to be adopted out
thats the cutest fcking thing i have ever seek in my intere life
he s adorable he looks just like my pudding as a kitten lt
michael rapaport wants to know what the fuck is that
early footage of the sonic the hedgehog movie redesign
i just queeled loudly resulting in a disgruntled face by my old cat lying next to me why hooman why
are we really not gonna acknowledge the wonky stick legs and massive whale ankle this was photoshopped to satans asshole
hope this little guy wasn‚Äôt taken away from his mother too soon
looks like he s saying you wouldn t believe the day i ve had
its face is a mess might be an infection might be nothing i trust a visit to the vet will happen in the next day or two to get that and other things checked out yeah
that cat looks like it s gonna talk to us about the importance of diabeetus so beautiful though
i have a himalayan just like that he‚Äôs a super sweet cat
luke skywalker cut the arm off of one of these in an ice cave when i was a kid
pretty sure that s the type you can t feed after midnight or let close to water
i hope i never have anything this cute otherwise i d hug it to hard and it would die
jesus christ did he walk in and say give me the ugliest cat you have i mean it s so ugly it s cute but still
get your brother a ferminator and tell him to brush the kitteh often long haired cats like this can get snarls in their fur particularly in the belly around their legs which can get worse as they try to bathe themselves and can limit mobility and become painful also the brushing will limit the amount of hairballs and shedding gorgeous kitteh
i want an update after you ve had the kitty for a little while please
is this grumpy cat reborn into existential crisis cat
where did he get that cat sorry to say this but that cat looks very sick please tell him to keep an eye on her weight from her face she looks malnourished where did she come from
it looks a bit like a grumpy cat or am i still mourning his loss
you should take it to a vet soon looks like he has some pretty watery eyes always a good idea to get them dewormed from a vet too
theresa may puts a brave face on brexit and downing street exit
lmao he looks like he s had a rough night what a cute kitty
demented evil eyes in a cute little fuzzy head with jelly bean toes
what is the purple object to the right of the kitten looks like an adult toy
tell your brother to get a reaaaaally good fur brush p
awww he looks like our cat who passed away recently
this a miniature monkey lion from the black sail coasts of the salt sea islands if ever there was one me lord
hey i got the exact same one age n all though it was born at home
i have the grown version of this kitten be ready for many years of ‚Äúhow are you even this cute ‚Äù
looks like he has some pretty watery eyes always a good idea to get them dewormed from a vet too
don t forget the murder mittens a cotton ball with eyes and murder mittens
feels like he ll grow into a cat that make people scream blink m fckr
grumpy cat needs a replacement she was quite the moneymaker if you feel like screwing around on the internet is a good use of life duh
that is going to be one fluffy floof when he gets older please i must see how he grows up ü•∞ü•∞
this cat looks kind of like the pile i get after brushing my himalayan i love it
small cotton ball with disproportionately large meows
ma there s a stray cat outside the thing looks like grandma
aww he looks like he s been in the dryer to long he s adorable
i feel like he‚Äôs judging me and sad by my life choices
you should demand he bring you a cat this way he goes and get s another one
looks like a lilac point himalayan at full floof it won t be able to groom itself
such a cute boy i‚Äôm so nervous for him being on the stove though
what a smart boy he s got to tackle a jungle his size first
oh noes not the stove just gently put him on the floor whenever he goes there it s dangerous area for a cat
those succulents aren‚Äôt long for this world i can‚Äôt keep them in my apartment at all my cats are obsessed just be careful if you see him clawing or chewing at them many are toxic to our kitty friends
bengals are so cute i love their personalities and the fact that i don t have to adjust to them
what is the charge eating a meal a succulent chinese meal
plastic and wild animals shouldn t be used for cooking
you should probably teach your cat not to climb on the stove
daww im getting a lil kit soon gotta get it a succulent
a kitten walking on a stove while eating a poisonous plant what can possibly go wrong
he is so cute beware that jade is poisonous to dogs and cats you may consider to put the plant somewhere he cannot reach
just a thought you do realize cats walk through their toilet and are now on your cooking surface right i like cats but fuck that
very strange had a cat that destroyed every succulent plant that we brought into the house had to stop buying plants because it became a waste of money that damn cat lived for years
i had a cat who loved jumping on the electric stovetop until one day it was still hot and he didnt realize never jumped on it again amp x b he was fine luckily
it s unusual for cats to have thumbs but it s even more unusual for cats to have green thumbs that s one unique cat
i have a slightly different model of that exact same stove a ge mc commercial mines a jc sj ss
very strange had a cat that destroyed every succulent plant that we brought into the house had to stop buying plants because it became a waste of money
it seems very naughty but worst enemy of mice in the home
theres no way seriously a cat who likes to play in water
omg my cat does this too except she wants to drink the water instead lol cats are so silly
that‚Äôs amazing i‚Äôve never seen a cat do that would you mind videoing it for our pleasure and lots of karma
my cat would wait by the sink for me to turn water on and he would play with the water some times he would sit in the sink with water dripping and play with it he likes to play with water in the bathtub too
my cat son likes to play in the water too i have a video of him putting his paws in it and trying to eat the stream of water from the tap
for loving that your cat is named fucking bucket that‚Äôs the best
your cat is broken and it defies nature and you should be afraid
can we please see a video of bucket playing in the water
my muppet loves to sit in the tub after i shower or the kitchen sink after i do dishes
what a sweet cat pretty unusual to love water does she launch herself in when you are having a bath i had a friend who bout a kitten that loved water and every time she had a bathe the kitten would launch itself into the tub
mine loves the bath too she hangs out on the edge as i shower and has started venturing in while showering and always without fail she will jump in when im done to play and drink the water
wait why is your cat named bucket why hasn t anyone asked this
i d like to see a video of cat playing in bath water
your cat may be defective get a refund she s a cutie
we have a cat named bucket as well d it is a wonderful name
if i did that with my cats they d straight up murder me on the spot xd
she s so cute i had a stray cat give birth in a bucket outside my house last year and my friend dubbed her bucket as well cheers to all the bucket cats out there mine has since been spayed and adopted to a new home
the bouquet residence the lady of the house speaking no we are not a chinese takeaway
my cat leia does does the same thing but then only plays with the water not in it she in fact manages not to get too wet she likes the water close but does not want to get in
my cat is also a water loving buckit but he‚Äôs a dumdum so we spelled it accordingly
you can t leave us hanging with only a photo now can we see the kitty playing in the water
my family has a cat like this she‚Äôs always in the tub or sink waiting for the faucet to be turned on we live on a creek and when she was a kitten she would come out into the water and hop across the rocks so she could stay with us while we swam
my cat kirby sits in the tub waiting for my yo son to climb in and cuddle with her while he usually surfs reddit
there is something wrong with the cat he looks suspicious
i had a cat that loved to drink up the water after a shower she then started meowing loudly in the tub at am wanting water in the tub i started just putting a bowl of water in the tub before i went to bed and accepted that i kind of felt like i out smarted the cat by tricking her
rub a dub dub my cat is in my tub most cats would just say fuck it unless you are best girl named bucket ‚ù§
mine does this too he refuses to drink from a bowl or a fountain he only drinks from the tub lol
damn they are sooo cute when they are young love the big ears
his ears are the perfect size for his body once he grows into them
remy what big ears you have all the better to hear you call me cute hooman
awww the best dog i ever had was a black german shepherd whip smart brave and loyal i miss that dog more than certain deceased family members
this creature is gorgeous damn near perfect very important things for all owners of all black german shepards owners lovers of german shepards in general and just people who love dogs and or history so we all know that for almost a years maybe even more though there s little historical record german shepherds have been used as police and military dogs bomb sniffing dogs drug sniffing dogs and even a dog s for the physically and mentally handicapped after world war ii there was a program in east germany and what became the czech republic run by both the soviets who were still in power in east germany and the still very much developing democratic nation of east germany to create an elite police and military dog to assist in stopping the large migration of german and other eastern european citizens who very much wanted to escape into the american run west germany this was due to massive food shortages and a lack of respect for civil liberties by the soviet military and even former nazi soldiers and regular german citizens who were given the opportunity to serve in police roles being closely supervised by the soviet military much of their mandate was to guard the berlin wall and as mentioned before stop people from escaping to the west this is where those incredible dogs come in to the story the police and military bread the strongest and most intelligence but also they used only the all black german shepherd dogs it was believed that they were more intimidating then the brindled or brown ones and they or not easily spotted at night for years these dogs were bred from the most intelligent strongest and the darkest for resulting in a subspecies of german shepherd which the akc calls the czechoslovakian german shepard these gorgeous animals are often a little bit larger and even more intelligent than the extremely intelligent german shepherd breed their most notable characteristic though is their all black fur though many have small white spots and therefor or have what they call sachs where anywhere from to of their pause have white for on them as time progressed into a more modern era militaries all over the world continue to use the czechoslovakian german shepherd as mentioned before as aid dogs drug sniffing and bomb sniffing dogs security dogs or guard dogs and police dogs or military dogs the females who are often times to pounds lighter than their male counterparts who often reach up to to pounds at their largest as well as males who prove to have a more kind and warm demeanor are used as drugs and bombs sniffing dogs and blind or deaf assistant dogs as well as emotional therapy dogs the more aggressive males are used for more violent jobs like police and military dogs or guard dogs for individual owners when i adopted my czechoslovakian german shepherd she had been deemed to sweet friendly and eager to play games to even graduate from the drug sniffing academy she is the absolute warmest sweetest creature to ever exist in this world she is as cute or cuter than the one who opened this thread i would love to add a pic of my zoey but i have no clue how i will try to figure it out and add it with an edit

ok the name of this child has to be rian amp x b origin of the name ryan from the irish surname o riain descendant of rian rian is an ancient irish name believed to be a diminutive form of r√≠ king hence little king from a world of baby names by teresa norman amp x b i gave this a lot of thought i don t know why but i did i am sure other people don t mind me naming their children for them

i want cat hat skin to be purchasable in every game that has skins
that‚Äôs a chat or as the french would say un chateau
so there s a hand holding the kitten in place this wasn t voluntary they re probably both annoyed people don t do this to your pets for internet points
the term cat hat is ambiguous it can either refer to a hat designed to be worn by a cat or a hat made out of a cat what you have here my friend is a cat cat hat

guys tomorrow it is my turn to repost this i ve been waiting patiently for probably a solid week
so this is what it would look like to watch a kitten hatch from an egg
i didn t know that i needed this thank you kind stranger ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
reversed and reposted i swear i see this same video twice a week on here
she was feeling not good inside the both hands therefore she came up to say that i am feeling bad as it is difficult to breath
try as i might i ll never be even half as content as this bird
this is indeed a very wholesome pic but for some reason it took me the longest time to see the bird s eye for what it really is
how they balance themselves while as sleep can human do that
that bird is thinking about you right now wondering when you will be back
haha yeah it s all cuteness till they decide to steal your jewelry while you are still wearing it i learned to remove mine before greeting strange parrots
he just wanted to pick those boogers hanging from your nose
it s the rare moment a hahn s macaw feels cuddly consider yourself special the hahn s that owns us would follow that cuddle with an earlobe bite
oh goodness he s the funniest pooch ever what a clever good boi
do any huskies grow up i have never met one that isn t a complete goofball
i own a husky and live in grand junction co it gets pretty hot in the summer we have a dog door where our dogs are free to go in and out as they please hours a day days a year my husky enjoys being outside in the summer as much as he does in the winter granted he is usually in the shade but he seems to do just fine he also is a dork and blows bubbles in the toilet and in his water bowl he also doesn t swollow his last drink and enjoys dipping it all over the house now the only time you will catch my chiweenie outside in the winter is when she is going to the bathroom
that s because i can t find them but i m glad you did
maybe there are many more in this subb but they are just too good at camouflaging
never thought i d need to see something like this but i do
nice focus i bet that s good enough to replicate op s fingerprint
is no one going to talk about the fact his hands are purple
whoever the of people are who didn t upvote this post are absolutely monsters
everly walking among ourselves down the corridor of chameleons
oh no i hope this doesn‚Äôt mean another day or two of ‚Äòi also noticed this sub doesn‚Äôt have enough ‚Äô posts gah
meanwhile i‚Äôm thinking she‚Äôs saying ‚Äúno don‚Äôt be so cute you‚Äôre tough working pup nope stop please don‚Äôt make me snuggle you ‚Äù
last week my girlfriend and i saw two doggo‚Äôs in training at the train station in venice italy it was so cute
this gets reposted so often it s starting to get deep fried
she s definitely hot she s not a cop though customs and border protection
can t wait for this to get locked like all the other posts
and pretty bitch for a sprinkle of extra karma ontop
c‚Äômon i get that she‚Äôs no but she‚Äôs hardly a dog either
this cat looks like a cross between a tiger and a house cat what exactly is happening here
he looks like he s that one mate that you have to hold back from getting into a fight with some rando when you re out on the town and everyone s had a few
i love the socks that face is saying why am i being carried around
if regular cats can fight bears and alligators i m pretty sure this cat can fight dragons and shit
that face screams i may be cute but if you hurt him i will end you
looks like he s that one mate that you have to hold back from getting into a fight with some rando when you re out on the town
wouldn t work against me would beat you up for the cat seriously cute cat
that guys about ft the cat is about ft long without its tail
maine coons are the best best marked with the big m on their head he looks like he is a short hair maine coon my family had one then it died really affectionate cats
honestly i‚Äôd rather fight a large dog breed like a german shepard a lb cat would absolutely fuck you up no question
i want him to be wearing an orb necklace that looks like a bit like a galaxy
that cat is too cute to guard anything unless he has the puss in boots thing going for him secretly a matador who fights crime n loves the ladies by night
gt the fuck you just say derek come here and say that to my face
beautiful kitty but make horrible guards as a whole unless its their food dish had plenty of kitties chase dogs out of the yard but mostly other cats cats are smart first hint of trouble they run think the only reason there are so many stories about kitties waking us in case of fire it s because they can t open the door
robber give me your money cat swatswatswatswat robber dead
how op how did you not see the purrfect opportunity to make the title this large kitty purrfect as a bodyguard at night
can you explain are you small or is that a cat from cernobyl
what in the world have you been feeding this monster
that baby face won t help it become the bodyguard you want will it
‚Äúhuman i will go out into the dark with you for snuggles ok ok good snuggles ‚Äù ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

wow it s the biggest cat that i ever seen i love it
large cat or small tiger now i can imagine what crookshanks was sort of like
looks like the cat for the anime the cat returns the exact same cute huge eyes
bhhhaaaahahaha if anything scares that cat it s going to rip the guy holding to to ribbons trying to run up his body and get away
one of my cats is just as big his sister is a third his size though shorthair with some form of mutation going on but hes healthy
must have been hard to leave a job with perks like this that face ‚ù§Ô∏è

thank you for dedicating your time to help these animals it‚Äôs cool to see so many happy donkeys on your page
wow just checked your profile you really are an ass lover
after getting a dog i have learned that they are a lot smarter than we give them credit for getting to know an animal or a person by spending time with them removes the whole self serving meat robot thing that we all give off i m just glad that my dog can t talk
not only rescued but by someone who also found the aw yissssss spot
it s not hard to see why donkeys were kind of a symbol for peace in certain ancient cultures the more i watch rescues the more they blow my mind with their empathy
she is so bae did i type that right it‚Äôs my first time
curious what do you do this big lug looks like he s having the time of his life
i just had a delightful time scrolling thru your other posts y‚Äôall are doing so much good i‚Äôd love to meet all of them ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
back home we have wild donkeys i used to love to see them but now more and more people are moving in calling them pests and even taking it upon themselves to rid the area of them thank you for rescuing juan
this is at abraham lincoln national cemetery in elwood il my friend works there and this is his pal joe
isn‚Äôt it bad to touch a fawn or is it just a wives tale about the human scent and all that
the mother is nearby watching fawns defence mechanism is to get low and hide if you leave it for an hour mom will come back
remembering the fallen all the many lives were lost bravely answered up their call knowing well the cost facing down the other side sometimes an unknown fear now all that we can do is hold their memory so dear
this is the most wholesomely american thing i ve ever seen in my life
it s a good story but doesn t stone lose its heat faster than the ground
the hound hates the mountain but likes little baby fawns
the deer is probably out looking for food and used the headstones to hide her baby do some research before you claim an animal is abandoned she probably abandoned it now that the guy touched the baby
were you able to get give the baby some necessary help thank you sir for standing up for america‚Äôs freedoms and all that goes into being a great country it all starts with you and your brothers who say ‚Äúnot on my watch ‚Äù god bless all members of our five fighting forces
they don t get separated from their moms the mothers leave them and come back dont mess with baby fawns
psa if you ever see a baby fawn leave it be i m not trying to scold this guy or say the fawn is definitely going to die or anything being in a public cemetery isn t exactly the most dangerous place for it anyway but many people don t know the reason mothers leaves their young by themselves is so that the mom doesn t bring attention to the fawn the fawn is much better off by itself since it will blend in is still and low to the ground foxes coyotes and depending on where you live bobcats cougars and even predatory birds prey on fawns by approaching or touching a fawn you re doing exactly what the mother was trying to avoid by leaving it there
i feel like i just gave the three dollars in my wallet to this guy at a stop light yesterday looks just like him and he told me to have a good memorial day weekend
a deer had a baby on our front porch and left it a day or two apparently that s a thing deer do when they give birth drop it and come back a couple of days later
so i jabbed a flag in her to keep her in place while i took a pic
yes they do i have personally witnessed someone pet a abandoned fawn watched it after from the barn with binoculars mom came back then immediately abandoned the fawn i sat there for days before i called and animal shelter to come see if it was ok malnourished and abandoned because of some assholes right to pet wild animals
well freedom isn t free it costs folks like you and me
its not a great idea to touch the fawn you shouldnt scent mark it in any way you can look at its ears and if they seem plump and straight the fawn is fine leave it alone
you didn t need to skewer the poor thing with a flag tho
leave the fawn alone it isn t seperated from it s mother she s probably getting water
she looks like a little ma√Ætre d ah bonjour mademoiselle i have your usual table waiting shall i bring you the wine list
hercule is that you he s trying to solve the mystery of the missing tuna
if she s gonna sit up there and sing with a stache like that she needs three partners and some straw hats
she‚Äôs adorable and looks like an italian shopkeeper in
excuse me good sir could you provide some kibble i am quite famished
i also have a groucho tortie she is very vocal as well
correction your mustache master sits on the counter and orders pets from her peasants
will somebody get this cat a monocle and a pocket watch already
they also look adorable carrying their babies on their backs
they can be cute but calling them ome of the cutest is a stretch they re more of an ugly cute their little faces are adorable and dopey but is usually curled into a angry grin when approached the rest of their fur tends to just look like nasty hair and they also secrete a very nasty smell when threatened but they re good no rabies pest eating bois so they definitely get points for that
australian possums are so so much cuter than american possums
we used to have a possum in our back yard that came every day to the compost pile to have a snack we called him fat albert and he was chubby and cute we never approached him tho
i caught my dog fighting a possum in the middle of the night once since then i ve been firmly on the holy crap those things are terrifying side of this debate
our dog shook the babies off a mama possum once and she took off we gathered up the five babies and raised them they were pretty cute and really chill we seriously considered keeping one as a pet but eventually released them all
sure but they also like to bare their teeth and hiss and they look like giant rats but they eat ticks by the bus load so they re okay in my book but are you a possum or an opossum make up your mind you can t trust an animal that can t decide on its name
we have them on our university campus and i love seding them at night
they will also eat the cat food you leave out on the deck and won‚Äôt stop when you reach down and let what you thought was your cat
any mammal can have rabbies and any mammal with rabbies can transmit rabbies possoms are less likely to get rabbies because they have a low body temp rabbies is no fucking joke it is a horrific way to die
sorry i won t buy that they are cute absolutely right that they re great for pest control though over of ticks that bite oppossums will just die and we don t really know why kinda fucking metal
they are cute but they transmit epm to horses which is absolutely horrible and ridiculously expensive to treat if the horse lives
the virginia opossum is resistant but not immune to rabies
he s holding you hostage don t you dare stop petting me
omg it s so mucho better than i thought it would be he s so cute and i don t even like dogs that much lt
all the pets so many more pets give him a thousand from me ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫

omg that is the cutest thing ever thats is totally why i want a goat for a pet
given how mechanical these hugs are i can only presume they ve had him at this for several hours now
so i m going to need the address of this place stat there is an alpaca in need of my love

i wonder if they‚Äôll still want them when they‚Äôre teenagers

holden caulfield wanted to be a catcher in the rye and this guy got to be a goat hugger awesome
hey goat guess what what is it other goat mustache guy is giving out snuggles omg i want in
this is currently sitting at our back door under the deck a quick google search says to obviously leave it alone as the mother may have put it there while searching for food we will see how the day goes before going further
have you never seen bambi i dont think its mum is coming back
we had one left in our yard for most of the day but it was gone by the next morning i saw mom next to our barn
that s amazing what did u do with this little one where was the momma deer
dispicable man cuts cat s paws off for lawn decoration
this is so cute and clever but on second glance reminds me of pet cemetery creepy now i have an urge to save this poor kitty from being buried alive think i am taking this way too seriously
somewhere behind that leaf is the owner of those toe beans licking its butthole
it looks like a cat was buried with a paw sticking out kinda disturbing
i wouldn t eat it if i were you it seems like there is hair in it never a good sign but maybe you can pet the bean
when you realize that the car is just eating it s own ass behind some vegetation
aw cmon if you‚Äôre gonna repost at least change the title
hmm this must me a rare specimen the ones ive seen are always pink on a while stalk or orange stalk ü§î
if op is just gonna repost for karma with the exact same title no less then i‚Äôm just gonna repost the comment i made the last time it was posted fuck it ‚Äúabout a chance that this cat was licking its balls when this photo was taken‚Äù
looks like a cat comes out of an cage and said ‚Äú i‚Äôm back b tches‚Äù
this is how cats are made for anyone wondering first the front beans grow in then the meow box at this stage it s still a plant shape eventually the kitten will burst forth from the bud and lay down to get additional sunlight
you should ve tagged it nsfw only position that paw makes sense is if he s washing his ass
sometimes when my cat sticks her leg up like that to clean herself i run over and high five her closest i ve ever come to seeing a cat eyeroll
it looks like they will do great this year make sure you thank your neighbors for the fertilizer
the farmers with the biggest beans have have the fewest mice
hey i want to make this my lock screen background it just gives me the giggles every time is there a higher res photo besides from imgur thanks üòä
this reminds me of when my twins were born it was a c section baby a was out and baby b gets the whole womb to herself now a womb with a view al the sudden a foot comes thrusting out of my wife s incision and with the green surgical drapes i swear on my life it looked just like this only it was a human foot of course i thought everyone in the room except my wife who was so drugged up all she saw was green monkeys for the rest of the day was going to die laughing the leg was all stretched out and the little tiny toes were wiggling around it looked like a strange little periscope looking around before surfacing thanks for this took me back to the best day of my life
that cat is definitely licking it s ass just outside of the frame
don t forget to water them and fertilize with pieces of chicken cutlets
the weather is suitable for all types of seeds and plant
my ex s black cat had black kittens and we always refer to them as the bean trio since i started calling them beans because of seeing posts like this one for example now we only have two of the beans but we always refer to them as the beans or grand beans from me
damn i didn t know that beans grow just like asparagus
i too have beans in my bean patch beans to be precise
reeeeeeeeeeee i couldn t find the orignal post bc reddit removes the sort by old thing but i m sure i saw it last year with k upvotes say whatever you wanna say but i ll stand my ground
help me human i am drowning dont make a picture help a comrad in need the plant is drowning me help dammmmmmmmmplmllpmlml cat
this post is precisely what i needed right now good heavens
spamwatch u specifictown u fitplum u seaplace u fitprimary
you know there s a cat licking its asshole on the other side of that plant
wdym danger noodle there is nothing dangerous about it
never imagined there are snakes that tiny it is just so unbelievably cute
awww i saw one wednesday when i picked my son up from school
the black stain near the other thumb is probably yet the first bite of this little beast
did anyone recognize and say what kind of danger noodle
awww so cute looks like they anticipate your visit every day
i have always wondered what the most ‚Äúpleasing‚Äù delivery route i‚Äôm assuming in this case is in the world like for different topics most beautiful people stops most eye pleasing nature stops most good boy stops etc and of course the worsts list too
i find it oddly comforting when a dog stretches like the brown one did at first it feels like a welcome ü•∞
whenever the old less energetic dog calmly waits for the pats it always makes me want to give them a few extra
my favorite part of my fed ex route was a house with german shepherds first time i went scared as fuck not the most pleasant sight seeing potentially mean german shepherds once the homeowner saw my nerves he told me to meet them they were very nice every time i went after that they met me in the driveway and gave me lots of love and kisses still miss them ever since i no longer work there
they look so happy yet confused that you‚Äôre not use both hands to pet em like usual
he has a special place in heaven waiting just for him bless his heart
his joy is infectious i hope he and his pup have many lovely years ahead
couldnt he lift the dog to the water or am i missing somethint
my initial thought was ‚Äúif he does this everyday why doesn‚Äôt he use a cup or a bowl ‚Äù then i immediately understood how ‚Äúuninvolved‚Äù that would be and now i prefer him to do it his way
this was posted before with a completely different caption get this repost out of here üôÑ
the joy this man gets from doing this most will never experience in their everyday life never too old to be kind üôèüèª
old man i see you re feeble friend but still you show you care how carefully to me you bend i m thankful that you re there so gentle are the things you do your loving heart i see i hope someone gives back to you the kindness shown to me
i m tearing up in front of strangers here in the subway
proof he was wearing that same thing last time i saw this post
gt everyday why wouldn t he just start bringing a little bowl
everyday you d think that after the first few times he d have found a container to make it easier for him and the dog any discarded mugs cups plastic cups paper cups tupperware bowls etc will work
really cute but i don t understand if he is doing this every day why isn t he using a cup or bucket or something instead amp x b the dog is like an exact copy of my dog but a bit bigger sent it to my kids and they could not believe it
oh man the old man s smile on his face just made my day
this made my day love the old man s smile too thanks op
he is bending over wrong seems like he is trying to put out his back
aww i do this every day too only it is while i am in the shower and the dog is my dog who for some reason loves warm shower water and stares at me until i do it ü§£
little people make little gestures every day that keeps us sane really nice
no he doesn t as that dog would move and probably wouldn t be there every day and also he could just save time and energy and get a fucking bowl full of water so the dog doesn t have to get tiny sips
this is so heartwarming although he could just a dish i love how the dog waits and respects him so much
‚Äúbro just get a bowl‚Äù on the real though this is lovely to see what a lovely gentlemen and such a handsome dog too
well you would think instead of just watching this every day you‚Äôd get the dog a damn water bowl camera man help that poor guy out
ok that s cool and all but who is just standing there filming him xd
some people are asking why tom the old man doesn t just get a bowl or something this is probably a lot to read but i ll try my best to explain tom lives a not so comfortable life his main source of income is to pick up trash in order to resell it to the government you can see the huge pile on tom s rolling cart that would probably only sell for nt or around usd i have talked to some people who i see every day doing these jobs and they will often tell me how lonely they are being widowed and having no kids to support them just look at tom s beaming smile no matter how painful and hard it is for him i really think he would rather hand feed the dog than leaving it with just a bowl of water in a sense the stray dog has become part of tom s life and tom has become a part of the dog s life this is a truly bittersweet story because tom and the stray dog are both isolated from society yet they still find joy within their time together amp x b i hope that the context i gave would be enough to answer your question to why tom doesn t find a bowl or something to feed the dog but if you have any more questions just send me a quick message
bullshit if that guy was doing that every day he d have just put out a bowl by now
further proof that the t shirt does not lie old guys rule
that‚Äôs cute but i say bring a bowl and leave it there filled then come everyday to refill it üòá
i hate to kill the mood but that looks like a public fountain so i hope that dog likes chlorine a lot
should just get a bowl and let the dog drink out of that way easier
i love how the dog dips his her head after like ‚Äúthank you‚Äù
how would you know he does this every day this is a repost from awhile back
looool repost and lies you don t know if he do that everyday and many has posted this
how you know he does this every day this ain t your video
doggo not thirsty keeps man happy by drinking from his hands
thank you for clarifying that he‚Äôs old i wouldn‚Äôt have noticed
the older i get the more and more i revere dogs i just adore these creatures being with my dog brings me so much happiness and contentment
that s a really nice dog dude should take it home with him
so is he still doing all this time since it was first posted by someone else its remarkable you know him personally too
if he does that everyday he should invest in a bowl
the comments section seems to have detoxified itself
i totally thought he was putting the excess water back
you think after a week or so he d get a bowl or something
this guy doesn t know that this has been posted like times
sweet and all but you d think he d bring a dish if he does it every day
damn i want to send that fellow a collapsible dog bowl
one day the old man will be gone and this makes me sad üò•
i hope no one tells this man that dogs cannot be muslim it would be so sad if blew himself up to kill the furry infidel
have i seen this post before or was there one that was similar
this is an old video from last year oh somebody just trying to get karma points by using somebody else s vid
nice of him and all but wouldn t a bowl work better i mean if doing everyday
it s beautiful one gives another purpose each finds happiness
the old man couldve gotten a cup or something by now
i used to do this for my dog in the middle of the night when he was thirsty üíï
its sweet but why not a nice bowl of water or a crappy bowl as long as it s full of water
if he does this everyday you d think the ol guy would bring a little bucket by now
i m thinking op is a dirty liar this exact same gif was posted last year
this is adorable just the best i have a border collie yesterday the bitch stole my lunch from the worktop didn t have any regrets either and that must have been at around the same height as what i assume is some kind of water feature this extremely gorgeous doggo could get his own water if he wanted to but he doesn t he wants old man hands water and this makes this one of the most pure things i have ever seen my border collie is nuts but she is genuinely the sweetest girl had only had her a few days rescued her from an evil bastard who was abusing and neglecting her when she got up from the floor wriggled into my lap wrapped her paws round my neck and snuggled her head into my neck and went to sleep been by my side literally ever since best dogs ever providing playing fetch for hours straight is your idea of fun
that goat is not happy goats really don t like being picked up source worked at a pressing zoo for a summer
goat does not feel good when someone raise it up therefore goat is crying with fear
im the happiest cuz i get to see those sexy armpits and some side boobage mmmm a very nicee
in this picture the human is happy the goat is terrified
animals don‚Äôt show emotions like humans goats can‚Äôt smile that goat is terrified
yeah fuck this bitch stop terrifying animals for your fucking instagram likes
bbbaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh zzeebbeennnyaaaaaa baabaadabishuuaaayyaaaaaaa
probably the first poster who posted this many many years ago
if she puts the goat down and it doesn‚Äôt run away then it isn‚Äôt terrified i know goats
wholesome af nonetheless thank you have made this young adult s day a bit better cheers
the new lion king looks different somehow i kid you not
i think op is the happiest getting this amount of upvotes despite all the disapprovals from the comments
that goes in the bottom right is the happiest i think
i m the happiest i get to see two cuties in one picture
nansi imbuzi ehlwitha ubaba sisho ingonyama amp x b nasi ingonyama ibamba uyise sisho uhhmm imbuzi imbuzi amp x b singuwina imbuzi imbuzi nendoda ebonakalayo
i can t stop picturing that the goat is simba being raised
ah a classic this takes me back to when i first discovered the internet
ohh the precious goat girl the woman looks like jenna fischer lol
i was at a zoo today and in the petting portion with the goats there s was a very specific sign about not picking up the goats i obviously went to the wrong zoo
it seems as though there would be a lot less war in this crazy world if people interacted with animals and nature more
one fell out of a tree near me when i was a kid it was confused and ran up my shoulder we became besties
when i was a kid i found a whole nest of them that had fallen out of a tree they were so young that they didn t have fur or opened eyes yet i begged my parents to take them inside to help them but they refused i stood watch over them all day but eventually had to go inside later that evening i saw one of the stray cats with one in its mouth all bloody i m assuming the rest of them met a similar fate definitely made me sad
i never had a pet squirrel but the squirrels at my mother s house aren t afraid of people and come crawl all over you even the babies
aw i used to rehab these little guys gotta say that‚Äôs an especially cute one
i took care of seven baby squirrels one time i came home one day and they were huddled together at my back door they were tiny i took them inside and fed and watered them until they were ready to be released that was sad day letting them go
this has been my discord pfp for years nice picture though
misread this to be i‚Äôve never seen a baby squirrel i an not disappointed in
cool squirrel fact the mums will sometimes carry their babies one by one in their mouths to a new nesting spot if the orange final nesting area doesn‚Äôt seem safe anymore also squirrel mums will take in orphan babies if the other mum gets killed or disabled was quite surprised to see a squirrel relocating one of her babies last year with a squirming cute baby in her mouth didn‚Äôt know just what i was look kup me at until i later did research
you had never seen one you have now you d seen one by the time you took the picture
oh man one time there was like a family living in the tree out front and i guess something happenmed to the mom and three babies ended up falling down into the yard and were helpless we had them for a few days giving em like pedialite and stuff till the humane society lady came and got them but they were so cool i think they must have been a different kind though they had sorta long gangly arms they hadnt grown into and clung to everything
my dog wouldn‚Äôt be disappointed either he‚Äôd chase that cute thing so darn fast
fun story when i was little approximately ish my family found and was taking care of a baby squirrel they named it miles because that s the street we lived on and i was throwing a fit because i wanted to name it rocky no idea why a little bit later i was outside playing and found another baby squirrel probably from the same family and showed my brother around who then got pissed because he thought i brought miles outside he takes it inside to discover that miles is inside and we now have baby squirrels finaly got a nutty boy named rocky
last year one of my cats brought a newborn squirrel home it must have fallen from a tree its eyes weren t open i fell in love hard it curled in a little ball when it slept i was keeping it in my bra i even had it at work one day no one knew by then it would call me with a little chirp i tried really hard but it didnt make it i wish so much i hadnt failed that little angel i have a new love of squirrels since then
come to think of it i‚Äôve seen a million squirrels but i‚Äôve never ever seen a baby one
i had to rescue one from the middle of a two lane road once mom got spooked by a car and dropped baby cars from both directions just sat there i guess not knowing what to do so i grabbed it and put it on the ground by the tree mom was in and watched she was too spooked from the whole ordeal to come get it i stuck it on a branch and mom came over
when i was little i raised two baby squirrels in my gmas pawnshop and we had them on display out front in they re cage until one passed away from old age and the other we set free
this looks more like a pixar caricature of a puppy than an actual living puppy wtf
definitely photoshopped there is the same photo with grey fur and bright blue eyes
wow yeah the carpet is grey the table leg is grey his eyes are solid black it almost looks greyscaled that s just me though
it s the back side view from where the yamuna river flows it s banks are filled with rubbish
i don‚Äôt know which is more beautiful the magnificent taj mahal or the majestic herd of our elephant friends
hey buzz chill chances are as one person observed this pic is photoshopped it‚Äôs been fun playing but i find it necessary to tell you how big my world actually is i‚Äôve been to countries and i fly st class over k miles per year visiting customers presenting technical papers at various conferences and the like i‚Äôm sure it doesn‚Äôt compare to your position where half of the time you‚Äôre asking your customers ‚Äúwould you like fries with that sir ‚Äù cheers
there s definitely a better kisser of the two and it ain t the brunette
so god damn adorable that i want to hate the guy and be jealous but it s just so wholesome
dog is trying to express that no one should love to you except me therefore he is giving the proof of his love and faithfulness with his boss
is that the guy who was huge when vine first started don‚Äôt remember his name
half of his face will be all wet and the other half will have dog germs on it
haha this is how my man wakes up most mornings he is out of town for the week and he misses home like hell amp x b lady and dog laugh hysterically
amp x b amp x b is this what having a life must be like
somebody cross post this to the incel forum it makes them hilarious
your supposed to turn your face really quickly so your girlfriend kisses where your dog just licked
dog was just licking its asshole and now it‚Äôs licking your face girlfriend was just licking someone else‚Äôs balls and now it‚Äôs licking your face
when i did this with my husband and our chocolate lab he said he hated it ‚òπÔ∏è
hey random handsome dude wanna trade lives i don t get very many kisses but you should see my comic book collection it s cherry bro
some people say money can t buy happiness but that dog probably cost
"asks him how he does it him step be attractive
me in my head step find a way to bypass step"
the saddest part about this video is that all of us watched it thinking must be fuckin nice dude that ll never be me
i was a big fan of him during the vine days he was one of the first popular ones
i would be happy with just lana rhoades licking my face
i don t know why but i instantly thought this would be funny if she was licking his face as well oof
i wish something like this to everyone here have a good life
this boi be getting kissed by his girl and his best friend at the same time and neither have a problem with the other
last time this was posted it triggered so many depressed people lmao
i ve seen this reposted a couple times and the comments are always the same hahaha
does someone have the video with sound i remember it having sound
lucky bastard my missus doesn t treat my like that anymore
so in this situation what if he gets hard is that weird if he does
god i would do anything for a relationship like that not talking about the dog üòÖ
those aren t kisses from the dog the dog is licking the salt off of your forehead
this video makes me want to go kill myself j k but good for him for having a perfect life
i have to know who loves you more and who do you love more
goals that s why i work as hard as i do so i ll be able to provide such a comfortable life for my loved ones
what a ridiculously good looking family adorable puppy cute girlfriend him with his gorgeous smile bruh can i get in on that
i seriously need to reconsider what i‚Äôm doing with my life i don t know if i need a dog or a girlfriend
same face he makes when having coitus and the dog starts licking his arsehole
i can literally feel the humidity rising from all the tears redditors cried while watching this video
damn this dude living such a good life in this moment that it don t even matter
ewwwww one of them was just licking its own ass the other is a dog
"baby i been droolin

the good about ppl with crazy empathy is that this things make you feel happy af
i think that is the physical embodiment of all a man wants in life
that smile definitely the thing that made me go aww the most
i m supposed to be sulking and sad today wtf do you think you are doing
yay it‚Äôs kristin lt she is so beautiful i‚Äôve followed her on yt and insta for years kristinjohns she has her own design brand and is overall very wholesome the guy is her husband marcus he was really big on vine
my cat shoves his asshole in my face while depression kisses my everysingle god damn second
dood has a smile just like oscar de la hoya hope he doesn‚Äôt have the fishnet stockings though
is it weird that his smile reminds me of james franco
meanwhile im here trying to get a star cougar on red dead
the reactions to this are interesting it s a good litmus test to see if you can empathize with his position or if you are filled with envy for it if you cannot stand to watch this then i ve got bad news for you
last time this was posted there was a huge outpouring of negativity from people saying that they‚Äôve never experienced anything like this and will never be able to experience such happiness because he‚Äôs extremely good looking and they‚Äôre not
i bet those somes are fun who is usually riding you and who is usually sitting on your face
wait he‚Äôs a friend fucking forgot his name he made a video about one year with his dog what‚Äôs his name
some are rich and some are rich in love others are rich in both but we don‚Äôt talk about those jerks
don t be a bitter incel and this too can be you live your best life send out positive energy and good will come back to you project negativity and negativity is what you ll get and that advice is coming from someone who is currently quite negative with health issues but committed to turning life around good luck
should have rubbed the peanut butter a bit lower rookie mistake
i just looked at my partner and said hey look it s the younger more attractive version of us cute
okay i rarely get jealous in life but seriously come on
this is cute and i‚Äôm very jealous and all but who wears fake eyelashes to bed those gotta be fake lashes right because if they‚Äôre not that‚Äôs phenomenal
at first i thought there was a third person in the room filming and probably crying
i wanted his to flip the camera around to see the cat attacking his foot or at the very least angrily mowing because the food bowl is half empty
if me and my girl are kissing no matter where my dog is at whether it be under the covers or in the other room soon as he hears smooching sounds he comes run and gets in the middle of our lips and starting licking away lol he wants all the kisses
so that s what it s like to be a good looking guy wow much privilege
this is the man whom i most envy in this life and i don t even know who he is
remember that the dog uses the same mouth to lick his her ass
i ve seen enough hentai to know where this is going
i wake up like this most days and it s exactly as good as it looks
god i hope that was me not because having a gf or whatever i just want to feel loved üòî
didn‚Äôt kentucky make this illegal or was that alabama
and then you wake up just another dream the same dream actually for the th time
his girlfriend kisses him on the cheek then his dog kisses the other he smiles with the fullfilment and contentment of his life he then awakes in an empty bed in a run down apartment his head hurts from the alcohol and heartbreak as he remembers she left him months ago and took the dog with her directed by werner hertzog
i have absolutely nothing and this man has everything
people all you have to do in order to be like this guy is follow the rules
oh my god that has to be the most adorable video i have ever watched soooooooooooo cute
oh holy shit i am so fucking lonely i‚Äôm happy for this dude but i want to cry lmao
i betcha they hook up together on the side when he s not home
even though i have a girlfriend i don‚Äôt think i‚Äôll ever have that type of affection
breaking news happiest man alive dies from cardio inflammation there was too much heartwarming activity at one time for one man to handle
lucky guy has two beautiful girls in his bed that cannot keep themselves off him
yeah it feels i m just about the only person in the world who doesn t like dog kisses dog kisses licks dragging their tongue across anywhere hand arm face bleck i hate it i don t know why everyone else seems to genuinely like or even love dog kisses i hate them i think it feels icky and when i think about it too much where the dogs tongue has been etc i think it s real gross then anytime a dog tries to lick me i put a stop to it i do have allergies to dog s too so i know that doesn t help my situation any anyone else with me here on this one or am i completely on my own
that is possibly the best descriptive phrase i‚Äôve seen in a month
these have got to be my two favorite dog breeds and now you put both of them in their fluff nugget form side by side it s more cuteness then i can handle
so cute i think i‚Äôm going to need a piece nugget asap
the edge of the fur on the right fluff nugget matching with the edge of the chair in the back is freaking me out
oooh the nostalgia my grandmother was a breeder had a ckc registered kennel and i would spend my summers growing up helping her raise and train all the puppers she gave me my best friend spring who lived to be yrs old before i had to make the worst decision thank you for sharing this it makes my heart happy and fills me with so many warm fuzzy memories üòä
our sheltie saved our lives years ago she wouldn‚Äôt stop barking one night so my dad woke up and turned on the news and sure enough there was a tornado lt mile from our house it gave us enough time to run into an interior room before it proceeded to pummel our home neighbors died and her warning was the only reason we didn‚Äôt add to that count got a lot of love for those dogs
i picture them getting ploomped out of a t shirt bazooka into the stands
grew up with shelties and their puppies are the cutest things ever
love shelties my boy cody looks like the one on the left
i miss my childhood sheltie gahhhhh i have all the feels because she looked just like the pup on the left üò¢üò¢üò¢
my wife had a sheltie before i met her i managed to get her the sheltie s approval pretty sure that s what sealed the deal for my now wife smart dogs
that dog looks like he knows he could eat you but chose not to
not saying he s lying but it s really hard to grow a beard at i ve tried
wouldn t care about any thieves in the house if i had this good boy living with me
really short man or really tall dog i‚Äôm seeing this as a really short man
don t know who she belongs too but she s in my garden a lot guess she likes me
gotta love when cats sleep like that so cute yet uncomfortable awkward points when it s not your cat
i have a few cats in my garden too and i want to interact with them please tell me how you lured yours
i dnot know if you guys will accept my joke but fbi open the damn door
cats don‚Äôt ever really belong to people but some people certainly belong to some cats
what do you mean you re spending time with the cat it s just a picture of a cat
spending time in the garden in someone else‚Äôs garden
tfw you look over the fence and see your neighbour dropping his balls on your cat
you down with opp yeah you know me did i get there first
is nobody gonna talk about the cut off human feet besides your cat üòß
everyone here is talking about how op has a new cat what if the cat already has an owner and it just likes to hang out with op would you like your cat to be stolen like that
why is there just a picture of lower legs and a cat where s the rest of him
call him achrhimedes he looks like my old cat of the same name
cats belong to no one we actually belong to cats then they train us to feed water and pet it at their will
my girlfriend made friends with an outdoor cat he was buff as hell i ve never seen a cat like him he easily coulda beat the shit out of me and taken my lunch money and i m not a small guy but he ended up being the sweetest cat he loved chest scratches but not belly rubs he d just flop down and want pets several times i fell asleep and he d fall asleep right against me disappeared one day and my girlfriend was distraught but he was well cared for and someone had moved in her neighborhood around the time he disappeared so we re pretty sure he belonged to them i told her there s no way he was killed that damn cat could flip cars and wrestle bears
i don t recommend bug killer in the garden bad for your health and the cat plus insects are dying off globally
oh my god that cat is laying with two disembodied legs
i had a himalayan cat who live in the house behind me and visit me very often he was a very sweet cat
damit no it‚Äôs so cute i hate that i can‚Äôt be around cats
it s a witch s familiar who s just resting after a long day
cats don t have owners they have staff you just got hired
as an owner of an outdoor cat i often wonder how many people own a cat vs how many people think they own a cat some days my boy ain t back for a week and he s clearly not starving
our garden just has veggies and herbs you must be growing catnip in yours
and then you go inside and your own pets smell you and know you‚Äôve been cheeto g on them
my neighbours cat loves coming inside our house just for pats she s so friendly we can t have pets here but i sneak her in sometimes when i hear her bell collar outside my window p
kinda weird funny but i have these exact same shorts it‚Äôs weird to see them
cargo shorts running shoes and a cat must be dan bilzerian
hello neighbor please allow me to keep your balls warm with my head
she must run like the wind because those are the most insanely high arches i ve ever seen
real question i see a lot of otters on reddit these days are they an actual pet now if so how they re aquatic mammals
omg those squeaks are beyond adorable also how did you get a pet otter
wait can you have otters as pets in some places i m curious
turns out my dogs squeak toys sound like an otter my dog really liked the video
once again what the fuck is wrong with you people this is a wild animal and belongs in the wild it is not your fucking toy
that why the squeaky toy companies make squeaky dog toys because of the dogs hearing the squeaky toys
zookeeper here working with otters otters do not make good pets asian small clawed otters live in big family groups in the wild have lots of behaviours and vocalizations specifically for living in groups it s just like keeping one meerkat or one monkey by themselves they are group animals and do better when with their own kind just like us on top of that they have extremely sharp teeth need a specific diet to compensate nutrition wise what they would eat in the wild and finding a vet that would treat them would be difficult and costly the answer is just no these videos shouldn t be shared around it gives people with more money than sense the idea that they can just buy an otter and keep it in their homes and more and more are taken from the wild as part of the illegal pet trade so many nopes all around
awww but that is fucked up and shouldn‚Äôt be a pet unless you also live in or on water it‚Äôs a baby and should be learning to feed not curious what a laptop is
seeing a few otter posts on here i m not so sure on them making great pets google terry nutkins and check his fingers
that is one of the sweetest things i have seen all day sounds like a little squeaky toy lol
aww we have wild otters in our pond they are so cute to watch play
if you are to own an otter does it have to have a place to swim
dogs like squeaky toys cause they sound like dying animals so whenever you dog is playing with a squeaky toy he‚Äôs imagining chewing up this otter nature is metal
i didn t know otters made noise normally or is this one in need of repair
about a million times cutter then all these so called cute cat pics in here today
i could never have an otter my dog would mistake that sound as a squeaky toy and well squeeky toys don t last long around here
i want to see a video of you touching the back foot and it shlooping up into the blanket
be thankful he isn‚Äôt laying under your bed like that my cat does that and swats at my feet as i get into bed scared me so much at first
when you want to be under the covers but you‚Äôre getting a little hot so you stick your legs out
love how your cat and sheets are colour coordinated
the cat made your bed that s awesome see if you can get him to fold your laundry too
plops onto bed after long day work ‚Äúthe blanket is yelling at me ‚Äù
always prod possible kitty lumps before sitting down on the bed or you may both have a very bad day
i cannot even attempt to make the bed my cat has an obsession with being under the blankets and sheets
i would ‚Äúloose‚Äù my cat like this and cry cause i thought he ran away
too funny our cat too plus we have same coloured sheets duvet and we have purple accent pillows üòÆ
my cat has her breakfast then comes back up to my room and shouts at me to get under the covers for cuddles
just leave your feet out the demons under the bed wont grab em
it‚Äôs all fun and games until you forget their there and accidentally lay on top of the sheets
if my cat did this i d actually make the bed rather than simply straightening it
proof everything knows the ‚Äúfoot out‚Äù trick of perfect temperature adjustment
i too like to stick out my feet from the covers i see nothing strange here üòâüòÇ
everyone knows that‚Äôs the best way to sleep you can‚Äôt get comfy until a foot is out from under the blankets
"equivalent of us sleeping with one leg out
but in tour cat‚Äôs case it‚Äôs all four feet"
i ve had a few cats that liked to get under blankets it seems to make them feel more secure
i do the same when i m half hot and half cold in the bed
it s the purrfect size cover it s too damned sunny i m tired leave me alone
i don t think you finished all of your laundry i see a couple of cute socks on your bed
i used to have a cat that did that or even fully hid under the blankets every time he heard someone enter the room he would meow to announce he was under the blankets so no one would sit lie on him
my cat always goes under the covers and leaves a paw sticking out i think he got sat on one too many times
my cat also likes to sleep under my comforter if it s too hot for that he ll go to the end of the bed and lay under on of the corners hanging down
classic gotta leave a foot or two out from underneath the duvet so you don‚Äôt get to warm
hey my cat sleeps underneath the bed and i don t even know she s there then she decides in the middle of the night she has to sleep next to my face
i do the same thing keep my feet and hands out of a blanket etc thats too cute üòç
it‚Äôs like the opposite of us humans he doesn‚Äôt care if the demons under the bed get his feet
my friend s little cat does the same thing only she hides under her area rug amp x b like u cant seez mee i can haz nina skillz
thouroghly inspect your bed before you get in so you dont land on your cat
when we had cats they used to love the waterbed at the time we had a queen size waterbed and almost every night when we got ready for bed they would be up on it they used to knead to bed but never used claws on it so as they pushed it would move they used t curl up under the duvet around my feet and thats where they slept a lot of the time they were strange cats as they also liked water if we were having a shower they would get in the tub and if we put the plug in they just walked around until they had to swim
both my cats sleep under the blankets i call them baked potatoes when they do that
my friend s cat does the same thing i almost sat on her once
clearly he s not afraid of the monter under the bed
gotta keep one leg and both arms out for the perfect balance of temperature
i have two that insist on being under the blanket we live in louisiana where it‚Äôs in the upper s already üòÇ honestly i don‚Äôt get it but hey whatever makes them happy lol
i remember when my cat figured out she could get under the covers one of the cutest moments of my life
my mom once spent an hour searching the house for our cat she was calling her name checking everywhere she could think of it was an indoor cat so she started panicking that she had gotten out after the first min of not finding her she was calling her name outside and nothing finally i was standing in the hall and just happened to glimpse the tip of a little white paw sticking out from under my mom s bedspread i just started laughing my mom was appalled that i could be randomly laughing until i pointed out said paws my mom was both relieved and incredibly frustrated from then on the bed or under any blanket was the first place we looked when we couldn t find the cat
my cat used to do this i had a single bed and had to get a bigger duvet so she could wrap herself in the blanket i miss that fur ball
i have a kitten and she went over the covers this morning and bit me in the ass
my cat loves sleeping under a blanket it is one of my life‚Äôs little pleasures when he crawls under with me nestles and revs his purr engine
who doesn t uncover just his feet when overheated because too much blankets is the normal thing to do let it be
light aversion can mean your cat is experiencing increased photo sensitivity this isn t always a sign of a progressive disease but you should definitely see a vet at the very least be sure to cherish the time you have left with your pet reddit probably
i do it too its temperature control d i always find myself waking up with my entire leg sticking out from under the blankets
i m in the habit of going for a short siesta in the late arvy to recharge and my cat always comes with and if it gets to snooze time and i don t look like i m getting ready to go she will insist
hello your comforter looks very comfy where did you get it
you can slowly hear them chanting one of us one of us
very cute partially invisible cat has perfect little paws
he she is a lump our cat did this all the time he loved to get under something weighty and sleep
jesus this is a gorgeous picture totally getting lion king and just raw pure fuck yes vibes
if he told me i had to go on a quest or invade a country i would probably do it
this cat is ready to either lead an army or write a symphony
that right there is a miniature lion he is gorgeous my god
a cat is never late nor is he early he arrives precisely when he means to
this thing is the stuff of nightmares in thumbnail though
wow what beautiful cat like a black lion this is the king of all pets
wait utah or massachusetts also i know that look the i missed you so much but also i m kinda mad at you for leaving for so long
he looks so much like my kaos how could you go years without kissing that face
there is just something so innocent about a close pic of a dogs face that makes you smile
this is odd but i have a dog that looks like the same breed also named logan lol
i came home from the navy and my dog didn t remember me it broke my heart
don‚Äôt you dare ever leave that precious angel baby face for that length of time ever again
this is literally my dog hahah except kobe is only so far such good boys
logan must be so happy i assume the last time you saw him was at least six years ago
i am laid up for another month so a friend is taking care of the day to day with my dog so every other day she gets to see me again the whining and crying is so sad and cute she won‚Äôt leave my side until my friend comes back to pick her up and my pup is excited to see my friend but no whining or crying just the tail wagging
what kind of dog is he i have a very similar pup and we are unclear what type of dog she is
poor ol good boy i miss him and he s not even my dog
no food is inanimate thereby having no mathematical abilities
my room mate made something similar to this he called it a pineapple bun because of its back
melon pan is amazing i get it every year when i go to japan
this is more aww then a lot of the things i see in aww so fucking yes
never thought that i would find a piece of bread adorable
its not food its just a squishy a lot of girls in my classroom have it
this the first thing to make me happy in months thanks op
it counts until your post blows up to k upvotes only then will the mods remove it
isn‚Äôt that a squishie because i have the exact same one
i was really confused because i thought that was a bat
please film this sweetie running that must be the cutest thing ever
it‚Äôs cute i‚Äôll admit but also breeding animals as fashion statements is super fucked up and hopefully in the future won‚Äôt be considered trendy anymore
look at that single eye poppin vein crossing right at the damn middle it gives me the chills
yeah natural selection would never have created that this just shouldn t be
are these like real or is this some genetic modification shit
i believe this is a french lop it‚Äôs an actual breed and not an accident
must have neck problems keeping those big honkers up all the time
for some reason floomp was the word my mind made up when i saw this
i don t understand if this rabbit is real or not if it s real is fantastic
is this real is this rabbit okay i don t think it is
if you don t believe in god ask yourself who else would take leftover parts and make something like this
o jeez i d flop those up on him like a built in blanket cape thing so cute
english lop in competitions of their points come from ear size shape condition
it must be nice to wake up and hear the birds singing in brazil
would love to hear where this is from so these people can be bombarded with hate mail for breeding animals just because its trendy without concern to their life
also if you look at the adult rabbits their ears don‚Äôt actually touch the ground when they‚Äôre standing
fluffo the th wonder of the universe the world s only flying bunny
like wtf is that will the bunny continue to grow and his ears are just still too big but it will all end up nice and equally large also what kind of monster rabbit will it become or is this some sort of breeding going to far because some people find it cute to torment animals
pretty sure that rabbit can hear us all commenting on his ears
also carol you know the one who lives a mile down the road yeah she is totally talking shit about you right now
sorry just had to rest my ears after hearing your bullshit
how it feels when somebody calls you a good listener
you either get good at photoshop or you live long enough to be an asshole
poor thing must get so tiring for the bunny having ears that big shouldn‚Äôt meddle with nature
i would die for tucker the is the flappiest fluffiest golden i have ever seen and the captions linda put over his shenanigans crack me up
how dad s take profile pictures p s tell tucker i love him ‚ù§Ô∏è
add the bortom text pathetic and boom you have a meme i would upvote i am going to upvote this to
so happy that everyone knows that this is tucker beautiful
he looks like he‚Äôs late for taxes but love him nonetheless
yikes my neck and cheeks are starting to sag probably need to see someone about a facelift so i can look like the slick young pupper i once was
he looks like a grandpa who just found the front camera on his new smart phone haha
i opened this because i was like ‚Äúthat is definitely tucker ‚Äù i see literally dozens of golden retrievers on the internet and in rl every day heck my mom showed and bred goldens for years and tucker still stands out in a crowd biggestflooferoninstagram
speaking of tucker do you think he has a reddit account
make sure to go check him out on youtube his videos are
i follow tucker on youtube and insta and whenever someone post his pic or vid here on reddit it s always pleasant surprise
are you short or is he big either way i still respect you
there‚Äôs definitely some force perspective here but damb is it good
i ve grown up with these animals my entire life and they re honestly the most gentle characterful animals i have ever met
i m pretty sure that is a cross between a grizzly and a polar bear
ohhh there‚Äôs one of these good boys at my dog‚Äôs daycare i love it when i have a run in with him gentle giant for sure
i love all dogs but i go all gooey over the gentle giants i love a big sweet oaf
damnit bitch u bout to get eaten let him get hungry u gone u gone die molly u in dangerüòÇüòÇüòÇü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
that girl is definitely short that being said that dog isn t little at all either amp x b but perspective is a thing bois
simply beautiful makes me miss my leo we lost earlier this year they are fantastic dogs so gentle and truly loving ours was the runt of the liter and ended up being the biggest boy of the bunch he topped out at about lbs before his health deteriorated miss you willie
i love love love leonbergers my dog is pounds and he is small next to a leonberger
even if the gal is small these dogs are immense my pound bernese looks like a mid size dog next to a leonberger there s one in my neighbourhood when my dog sees the leonberger he gets a stupid look on his face as if he is saying is that a dog
how old is this video the blond guy at the end looks like david bowie
this little guy is mature as fuck you can see it in his eyes
i would have loved to see hugh freak and knock that brat out cold with a cool punch in the face
much better than kicking him in the back and it is funny
i too view hugh jackman as a cuddly furry thing with claws
you can tell by that smile he s gonna tell everyone he ever meets that he made wolverine shit his britches
probably did shat himself stood up to leave quickly
where s that video of the kids recognizing that he s wolverine by miming his claws that shit s adorable
reflexes kick in blades come out kids loses head whoops
that was a real flinch too he played it off almost immediately but the kid got him there
you can see him try to pull out his claws little man is lucky
lol the look on his face before he makes hugh flinch went from forrest gump to floyd mayweather in no time
it s funny that he s doing it but he learned this behavior which makes me a little sad
i wouldn t trust him children are not so different from wild animals that s why we need to protect them but also fear them
i always hated kids families that were hostile like this
this a completely uncomfortable situation that you guys are all denying as hard as you possibly can great to see the level of honesty society is reaching
he really did get him then hugh did the mock flinch that look the kid gives after is like ya what i thought lol
maybe he was checking if the claws actually come out
hugh gave a great performance that s the word on the street anyway and i scared hugh to no end with my fake punch so i scared the guy who captivated a thousand guys can you believe that a thousand guys
boy that s old hugh isn t really jackman ed and he s actually in the same place with his wife
i really love how much of a great sport jackman is he‚Äôs so approachable as a celebrity
that kid is a great xman he made wolverine flinch lol
i thought he really flinched at first then acted silly to play it off but then i remembered he s an actor
hahaha he tried to play it off like he didn‚Äôt actually flinch
hugh jackman doesn‚Äôt look as much of a huge jacked man as he used to
he was trying to dodge them baby aids let s be real here
hugh jackman so tried to play it off like he didn‚Äôt really flinch well done little fella
that side eye grin yeah play it off actor man we both know i got you
aw is this in ethiopia there s another video with him being recognized as wolverine the kids were so cute
i like the brief moment where he is ready to deck the kid before he realised what the kid was trying to do
we hold hugh jackman in the same regard as tom hanks and keanu reeves right just making sure i‚Äôve heard nothing but good things about him
insert gif of little boy asking hugh if he‚Äôs wolverine by pointing at his knuckles
you guys laugh at it but when kids like this grow up and migrate to more civilized countries they keep acting like this and threatening people no thank you we don t need kids or people like that you stay over there
this kid too cute bro he really tried to punk dude too lolüòÇ
that kid is going to be smooth as fuck when he gets older
wow whoops hahaha i have nothing to say for myself that‚Äôs a hard whoops
hugh trying to brush off that flinch like he totally meant to do it üòÇü§£ way to go kid show ‚Äòem who‚Äôs boss
he instinctively went for the old wolverine claw deploy
the hardest question who‚Äôs a better person keanu reeves or hugh jackman
you can tell he actually flinched then tried to over sell it to make it look like he was acting
hugh jackman hands over adamantium squeleton to kid
i like how hugh jackman tries repeatedly but absolutely nobody around him is willing to flinch for him
people act like flinching is a bad thing but that just shows that you re reflexes are working
i got scared and i m in rome if i had been there i would have had a heart attack i m with you hugh
it looks like for an instant that hugh legitimately thought he was going to be punched by a kid then played it off
i ever tell you guys about the time i punked wolverine
is it just me or does he look a lot like a more buff david tennant here
this is not nice behavior this is what bullies does just because he is a small kid doesn t make this behavior cute or nice
if i was paranoid stoned i would ve had a heart attack
he‚Äôs so proud of being able to scare the jean valjean the man did years in prison for crying out loud
the weird thing is that you can‚Äôt tell for certain if this is hugh jackman or david tennant just by the video
i don t understand what s the good thing about making someone flinch if someone was found to punch you you would want to dodge it never understood this meme
lil kid is lucky he didint hear a snikt shit would have gotten real than
hugh jackman i such a great person truly a gem of a human being
how the fuck is that awww more like aaahhh look another migrant who‚Äôs gonna mug and rape people
he prob saw what happened to arnold a few days ago üòÇüòÇüòÇ still cute tho lol
i didn t know racists could be experts in developmental psychology they must be cus there s plenty of em in the comments
i like how he stands up like hahaha lemme just nope the fuck away from this kid
fuck white people a kid messing around with a superhero uh oh he‚Äôs a scary migrant stand your ground bang bang bang
is that blonde his wife cause it looks like jerrod blandino
can someone edit this to make the kid grow some wolverine claws
since when are normal reflexes taken as a sign of fear
hes still worried about what happened to arnold i mean just because arnold is made of metal doesnt mean everyone else has metal bones or anything
idk it just kinda begs the question on this child‚Äôs life experiences these motions are learned
first he actually flinched and after that he acted a bit
he tries to make it look like he flinched on purpose
poor boy while this os kind of nice for jmhuge jackedman to take it as a joke you cal clearly see where that kid learned that from his borther or dad tought him to act or then he just picked up on it like a thug as they propably are no well behaving kid raises their fists and makes an attacking scare motion especially to strangers
this boy must be a comedian in the making www financialliteracyblog com
he looked genuinely scared for like a millisecond lol
that is likely a learned behavior on that kids part growing up with big brothers anyone
kinda thought he was david tennant at first am i the only one that sees that kind of fein the hair and the scruff i think
this isn t cute it s incredibly sad and depressing kids mimic behaviours they see they re literally machines designed to mimic obvious the kid has seen people behaving like that and i m going to guess based on the desolate surrounding that it wasn t on a screen like where kids in the west often pick up these bad behaviours
this is what makes the friendly world go round i wish that friendliness camaraderie warm heartedness empathy all the oxytocin feelgoodness there is nothing wrong with feeling happy this is not a sign of weakness which the naysayers promote would become the figurative social lingua franca no one loses in a win win
he fucking flinched then in the process of flinching makes it a fake one now that s acting
he actin like he wasn t scared but the boy knew he s acting
of course he flinched you don t expect young boys just standing there to suddenly do that that s pretty cute tho
haha i think there was a real flinch in the beginning very adorable
edited we all stopped laughing when he popped his claws went into berserker mode and eviscerated the kid
jackman wasn t flinching he was getting into fightin mode
hugh jackman is a wholesome man we must protect him at all costs
he s clearly stoned he even flinched from the woman reprimanding the kid who could easily see hugh was on one
pro tip if a young kid asks to high five fist bump you always act like they hurt you and tell them how strong they are i started doing that back when i used to volunteer at schools never fails to make a kids day
for the rest of his life he s going to be the boy who made hugh jackman flinch his minutes of fame have begun
lol he did actually flinch two flinches first one was real second a cute act for the kid hehe putting those skills to good use
hugh jackman is one of those guys who had to have a small penis good lookin rich great personallity literally the fucking wolverine what more can you have if he had a mongo schlong the world would not be fair
jackman thought he was gonna get aids for a second there
yeah but that kid would have kicked his ass though i can just see him turning gremlin in an instant
lol he actually did though and he tries to save face a lil bit big cute
if i had the skills i d photoshop wolverine claws on both of them it would be awesome reddit help
if a kid has the balls to drop kick the terminator i dont doubt a kid has the balls to punch wolverine in the face
aww adorableness all around both hugh and the little boy are cutie pies
why do kids who live in these conditions act like adults idk how to explain it but they act super mature n shit
i like how he tries to play it off like yeah where all having a good time but in actual fact a toddler made you flinch
he‚Äôs just trying not to catch the poor from that kid
fake ass wolverine don‚Äôt know shit about these streets
proceeds to beat the fuck out of that kid to show alpha male stature
the bad taste of the community indulge the bad manners of the child
less cute when the kid later jacked his car and cornholed his significant other
would the majority of people flinch even if it was just a kid feel like its just a natural instinct
i would marry hugh jackman if i could i am not even gay
i would have twatted the little shit in the jaw for that wrong move do you know i am buddy
if it were my dog he would take it drop it on the ground hop around it for a minute nibble it a bit and drop it again then finally decide it eat it or begin rubbing it all over his fur silly pups
and she rewarded the behavior so now he will keep doing it
the reason she looks over the edge like that is because she s actually on a rd story balcony
who read the title in kelso‚Äôs voice from that ‚Äôs show
at first i thought she had that snapchat baby filter on probably because i am new to snapchat
thats a poorly trained dog most peoples at worst sit at their feet and beg for food but this ones jumping up and swiping at people and they reward the behavior
was that so hard jacko awaaaaay i go love you stupid dog
this dog ses pretty disrespectful i gotta say tapping the legs when a dog wants something is one thing but getting into a person s face area like that that s no good
every fucking dog behaves like they haven t eat anything their whole life wtf
loll if he s anything like mine he probably just wanted to taste it and then spit it out
and that s how you encourage dogs to claw the shit out of you when they want something
enjoy the karma reddit loves idiots encouraging undesirable behaviour in poorly trained animals
at least the reddit dog experts havent made it to the top of the thread yet i love this just an american girl eating with her family in her backyard look how comfortable she is with the dog the cameraman everything i wish we lived in the harry potter universe where pictures move i would buy this for my wall
what is this trickery amazon link for all the internet cool points please kind stranger
explanation of technology this has to do with refresh rate of the led basically the led lighting is flickering at a rate that creates a shutter effect for the human eye the water is falling normally but we see droplets rise because of the way led s are flickering
i liked when it looked above the lamp at one point to see where the water was going
i doubt if dogs can really see this i mean that depends on how time sensitive of eyes right and are dog eyes can see the same effect as human eyes see
how do you know the dog is confused maybe hes just thirsty
do animals see this the same way we do like do their eyes have the same refresh rate as us
now what have i been saying all night the closer you look the less you see
im confused by hydro lamp i love hydro lamp hydro lamp
to be fair to the corgi i m also confused by the hydro lamp
i am confused to me the water is falling downwards normally the but that confuses me is how can a dog stand on a ceiling so easily oh wait
so it works on peeps an dogs what animal or plant or fungus does this not work on
shut up and take my money no i m spending more money
i m confused by a hydro lamp read top comment ok i understand now
corgi confused by a hydro lamp bitch i m confused by a hydro lamp
huge thank you to the people in the chat casually keeping me from having a mental breakdown over how the hell this lamp works
well apparently i have the intelligence of a corgi because i don t get it either
what‚Äôs he confused about he drinks the water we are the ones who seem to be confused
boring side note dogs see at a higher fps than humans do there is a decent chance this just looks like a stream of water to the pup
dogs can visually perceive events over shorter periods of time than humans so most videos meant for humans look jittery to dogs basically they need a higher frame rate video than we do for it to not be noticeable i wonder what affect that has on his perception of the hydro lamp
i‚Äôm confused by the hydro lamp how long has this been a thing
aww just like that one video of the cat being cobfused by a hydro lamp so cute ‚ù§
so does that mean dogs see with the same refresh rate as humans i once heard insects have higher fps which means better reflexes and makes it hard to swat a fly
scrolled through the comments just to make sure i wasn‚Äôt the only one also confused by the hydro lamp
i have the same exact amount of understanding of what i‚Äôm seeing as the corgi does
how in tarnation did this dog learn this incredible
edit dog holds brush and is directed by own with stick
you se his tail stop wagging when his concentrating and then right away happy tail so cute
you should meet his brother supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
no how is it possible even though that kind of breed is extra smart
oh my god he didn t get a treat at the end i am literally shaking nd crying rn
that wasn‚Äôt his name but since it‚Äôs the only word he knows they started calling him that
where did you get him he looks exactly like my dog but way smarter
australian shepherd blue heeler cross i have one too his name is major
we have a dog that doesn‚Äôt have a fraction of intelligence he would‚Äôve run off with the brush thinking it was a stick
jumpy has passed away go check him out in chon s music video for waterslide
im glad for happy stuff but do you gusy ever think of the training it went through not even owner i bad but some owners are some terrible people thatvtrain dogs to do things
let everyone else worry about boston dynamics this is how mankind truly meets it s end
wtf is wrong with you people this doggo has had to undergo severe training or worse to do this just for a few likes on reddit fuck that
this is hands down one of the best things i ve seen on the internet
why is the dogs name jumpy that‚Äôs the real question
this is absolutely amazing that is a skilled and rare pupper
i‚Äôm afraid of the weird horror scene i would come home to every day with creep writing all over my walls
my dog can fetch my dog can role over you fucking normies my dog can write its name down get creative puts on sunglasses
we would need a really big piece of paper because my dog s name is didgeridoo
the human has string attached to the brush check out his left hand to the right of the frame
um isn‚Äôt this kinda like humans learning to use fire like did we just witness something really big
this dog can write his name my dog can t even find a ball when it is right in front of her
is he by chance an associate of a girl named zero and has mistakenly entered the wrong body and this is his plea for help
can someone photoshop this to make it say ‚Äòsend nudes‚Äô
his name was actually spike but jumpy was all he could write so it was easier just to rename him
i think i found going back over the u and touching it up the most interesting obviously hes following commands direction from the stick or something but it s pretty amazing that s hes doing it and him being able to correct a dodgy letter and comprehend going back over what s hes already drawn is the most impressive part to me
if you can control them like running drones to herd sheep you can train them to draw this is a brilliant use of a shepherd s bred in talents
damn it s really convenient having opposable thumbs
my son s fish s name is also jumpy i don t think he ll learn this trick i don t think he ll learn any tricks
look i can write good boy what have you written i don t know i can t read i m a dog
if i were trapped in a dog s body this is exactly what i would do
swear to god it looks exactly like one of my dogs right down to huge fluffy tail
border collie is the smartest dog i have ever owned but they are also an emotional breed and don t handle scolding well they will pout for a week
someone give that pupper a treat and some bellly rubs
yes doggo finally as good as the elephant smarties that did this a while ago
not to be dramatic or anything but i would die for jumpy
obviously he isn t aware he s actually writing his own name right
how much can i buy this for lt lt lt its got that art style exactly like a kid wrote it and its so wholesome
how many border collies does it take to change a light bulb one and he gets all the wiring up to code
for a second there i thought he was gonna wrote jumanji
just needs a little jumpy footprint before it goes on the wall
his name is dave human has good heart not to make fun of learning disability
between dogs ing and painting it s name i choose this as the most interesting of the two things i ve never before seen
is he controlling her strokes with the stick or is she doing the strokes on her own
i know the dog doesn t actually know what it s writing but just the fact that the dog can do that is still blowing my mind
dude has fishing line hooked on his finger that s attached to the brush
i ll never amount to anything in life as this dog has
every once in a while my dog would stand in a corner and if you called her name she would hit her head on the corner from turning her head to look at you
watch out peta might file a lawsuit due to infringing the dogs copyright the paining belongs to the dog fuckpeta
this is awkward think i need to spend more time teaching my year old to write her name lol
for a moment i thought s he was writing my dead dog‚Äôs name and i held my breath juma
i taught my dog how to spell and thought that was good maybe we ll try painting next
why is the lawn only half mowed it s making me itch
that deer is like sup bitch what are you going to do about it
wtf is up with redditors finding bambi at their doors
what a charming house that deer is too cute hope it enjoys its visit
cue for the guy that snatches it and runs to his car
cue all of the comments about how it isn t cute and the deer is somehow in danger
just be careful moms are extremely protective and dangerous they have been know to stomp people does not end well for person
closer you are to danger the further you are from harm lol
was going to order one of those but thought the price was a little dear
i would be a little concerned about the rabies and ticks
plot twist the deer is the package and op is the cute one
the types of plants and how in your trees it looks like early spring while here the forest is full of thick dark green leaves it‚Äôs a balmy degrees here today
we had a fawn in our yard last summer we all thought it was so adorable but i knew they usually are never far from their mother after a few days of him hanging around i knew mom was most likely struck by a car i found the baby dead a little over a week later my kids were pretty upset üò≠ i was kinda hoping he had learned enough to survive
that s the new amazon deer sentry package theft deterrent you must ve opted in for beta testing
did the mom ever come back it‚Äôs not uncommon for does to abandon their babies if it‚Äôs alone for more than a few hours mom may not be coming back and you should call a wildlife conservationist or animal control this looks like that could be what happened üòï
you shouldn t touch it the parents can and probably will abandon it if they smell a human on it
cute deer gorgeous little house wow i‚Äôd love to live in a cute little cottage place but then i know someone would love to live in my s redbrick house
puma just the first name in my head when i saw the guy
moose i don t know why it just popped in my head when i saw the picture
teal like the colour of his eyes or maybe ollie or dewey
finn you can call him finny mini finny etc we always give our furbabies nicknames
larimar or larry ya know for the gemstone his eyes remind me of that
twenty minutes for the past twenty minutes i ve been watching this no one came to open the door or at least look who knocks god people today
man this is a long video minutes of knocking and the cat s still trying are we even sure anyone s home
we accidentally taught a cat to do that it perpetually wanted in and out of the house not being slaves to the cat we didn‚Äôt constantly stand at the door in case his highness wanted in he learned pretty quickly that a knock at the door someone getting up and answering so he started using the knocker
the cat is using the handle as support as soon as the door gets opened it s going to fall
this would be very creepy for the house owners if they have a peephole or can see through the window up top and the mail hatch randomly knocking door yeesh on the other hand that cat watches waaaaay too many people knock in that door to know what to do
do you have a moment to talk about our lord and savior ceiling cat
why does this video end without the cat getting in what sort of monster would burden the innocent people of reddit with this most horrific cliff hanger
karen dammit open the door i know you are in there karen
they put a little shelf there for her‚Äîwhy aren‚Äôt they answering the door
can we get a complete pic when a bunch haven t been rented out for the day
that dog loves you so much look at her face she‚Äôs in heaven
i hope u both have the best time and she gets some snacks she looks like she deserves them üòä
bran‚Äôs is named summer too so nymeria and summer perfect
cute dog but what s with the floating head right next to her
serious question is that a technique you guys use to get people to come over so you can sell them
that can‚Äôt be the goodest girl ls sitting next to me
no disrespect staff sergeant but where‚Äôs your cover
cool looks like you‚Äôre all set to trick poor and at risk kids into giving their lives to die in pointless wars started for profit re election you‚Äôre probably a nice guy but your job sucks dude
awww nymeria is such a cute name for a staff sergeant but pretty sure that s a boy
i was gonna say thanks for your service and what a beautiful girl
everyone is fawning over the doggo and it s handler meanwhile here i am trying to read the fuckin backwards url next to the dude s head
op if you were trying to block your name tape to maintain anonymity you should have hid the pcs on the table
it looks like you run a recruiting booth for the national guard weird question but does anyone going to a festival want to join the national guard i am having trouble imaging a bunch of college kid drunk and or on molly wanting to sign up for the national guard at a music festival but maybe festivals are different where you are we have like a different edm festival every month out here
thanks nymeria for serving and protecting our country that s a cute dog what s its name
you like taking advantage of the gullible and desperate man luring them with a cure dog is low
are you based at camp williams or whatever that one is south of salt lake lol
what the process of prior enlisted rejoining guard as a a one recruiter told me that the unit won‚Äôt accept people off the street as a pilot that i should join and then they‚Äôll send me sounded like the green weenie wanted to screw me again but i want to be a pilot i‚Äôve passed the sift and already have the flight physical for my civilian job
should block out the names lol i almost miss recruiting almost
so how many people have you lured into signing a year contract with doggo
listen you guys already got me no need to try again
fuck the military get the fuck outta here with this bullshit
"really nice pic
also dude looks like the one from the purge"
youi ll ask me to re enlist i ll say no but if you offer a pupper like this as a sign on bonus i might reconsider
patrolling the mojave almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter
when the good staff sergeant shows the recruits how to take a good tinder picture
and so are job recruiters for other businesses and careers his job is get people to join the guard no different then any other sales person trying to get someone to buy into their product
good to see all the branches are forced to volunteer for these kind of things gotta get that pr
how old is your mal and was she bred in iowa mine is years and she had a sister named nymeria they look incredibly alike
a nasty girl recruiter with that haircut somebody wants more boys in uniforms
warrior princess of the rhoyonar who lead her people across the narrow sea into dorne and allied with house martell to dominate the kingdom unbowed unbent unbroken motherfucker
look at bootstraps ken over here wow man did you win the genetics lottery or what
it s been my dream for so long to have a husky and name it nymeria my parents are very religious and don t allow dogs and that is a different kind of pain
my retired marine husband would say ‚Äúkeep your head on a swivel‚Äù i‚Äôll say ‚Äúkeep your head down‚Äù be safe
those claws look almost as sharp as my goldie‚Äôs ahe needs a trim
‚Äúi have very good hands sir please don‚Äôt make me use them on you ‚Äù
i was thinking maybe glitter general bedazzling shake things up a little
beautiful should have more vegetation and less stairs behind him though we all should be free
i wanna hug this kitty and hope it decides not to kill me
this is achilles he lives in a wonderful land with eddie and his murder kitten frends
i m pretty sure i saw those claws on a horror film man has that actor changed
rawwr i‚Äôm kink of jungle fear me or i eat you my claws are sharp and strong they help me defeat you kive me your love don be rude don make me angry or ill make you my pet food
aw don t mind him the little guy is just curious what your insides look like
top half hewo fweind i is tiny tiger bottom half i am going to murder you
his chis would be prime scratching territory and his fluffy chest
if kitties have murder mittens then these must be called homicidal hands
looks mixed with either a chow chow or a chow pit mix
holy hell that pup is soooo lucky i would annoy him so much with my hugs
i no scientist but i‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs not how science work
part stuffed animal for a moment just looking at the thumbnail i thought they were adorable
how can one animal be both cute and majestic at the same time
definitely the offspring of a very brave dog and lonely female bear
the cat is cute it turned out perfectly but it was not concentrating as the girl was kissing it with keen interest
the first step in the healing process is admitting that the picture you took with your cat isn t perfect well done
aww kitty s face is like getting a surprise kiss from a crush adorable
thanks for the laughter my kitties would agree with yours
i think it turned out just perfect op your cat is adorable
if i tried this with my cat the resulting picture would be me in mid scream with his claws buried in my eyes and his teeth latched to my nose my cat is an asshole
classic oh man i m crying i m laughing so hard good stuff
have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moon light
‚Äúwe are going to take a cute picture together also i‚Äôm going to check your prostate ‚Äù
ahah it was like why you insolent human i am god of kitties
this picture turned out even more perfect than intended
well it is good indeed you can call it an unexpected good
that s pretty damn cute it looks like you re kissing a nightfury dragon
what do you mean it didn t turn out good i want this on my wall
looks like it s about to pick up that pencil and stick it in your eye
the fuck sharon what if tinker sees this she ll think i m cheating ya dumb bitch
this is a feature not a bug dog is working as intended
that s my second post in aww and i didn t know that it would hit upvotes thanks i think i will cry
he s just lonely and has no other dog butts to sniff
you must have not read the instructions it doesn t look assembled correctly
looks like he s discovered the way to sniff his own ass there are many dogs out there waiting for his guidance he should now go forth and teach them
don t get it wrong this dog is not broken this dog is vindicated after years of struggling he finally got that tail
not many people or dogs can say they are sitting on their own head
nope that is doggo yoga and a nice downward twisted doggo pose
he is a very strange boy but i love him and want to give him kisses
when you take a large shit and there‚Äôs no toilet paper left
this is what happens when you try to assemble the ikea doggo on your own and you probably have a few extra parts that you don t know what to do with
he ultimately achieved his goal and outsmarted the tail by coming from the bottom well done boy well done
he looks like he fell down the stairs in family guy
i ve slept like that woke up feeling better than when i woke up as a kid
first time i see a dog that sits on his own head good boy
is there any actual reason dogs do this my dog does this a lot and it‚Äôs hilarious
dog exe has stopped working do you want to report it to the developers
he attempted they forbidden alchemic practice of doggo transmutation
the noise came from somewhere in this general direction
not wearing contacts thought this was a giant piece of fried chicken
hope you let her in is it your cat or just a hungry stranger
as long at you don t feed her after midnight i don t see what the problem is
poor baby looks like it has some sort of skin condition
this gremlin looks pissed that you are even considering eating tuna without them üòÇ
your kitty or a visitor we had something similar happen we heard this soulful meowing we thought it may be our cat open the door in pops a cat goes into the kitchen sits down at the dog s bowl and waits wasn t our cat but was very hungry
guys you can clearly see the lines from where it was shaved probably full of mats and got shaved amp x b that being said this looks a lot like me scrolling through reddit on my ipad
either a poor crossbreed with a spynx or it has v poor skin conditions hope it got looked at and fed
that looks like one of those hairless cats but it got into some rogaine
came here for the gremlin comments reddit always delivers üôÇ
we actually got this one overseas and later moved but it really depends where you live if you do a bit of research you should be able to find a breeder near you
i thought it was a hairless cat that had mysteriously grown some hair haha
someone needs to make that into a shadowboxing or martial arts sparring gif
unless you are a fish and are having sex you cannot make tuna
fiending for that tuna looks like one of those crackheads that knocks on your car window at the gas station lmao
my tuna brings all the cats to my yard damn right i like their paws
before scratching the door it scratched its way out of the pet sematary
why does this look like a hairless cat that studied really hard and figured out how to grow hair
it looks like it should be hairless but it s got a problem where it grows in sporadically actually it looks like my facial hair when i don t shave for a couple days
this cat with tuna is like me when i hear the three words dinner is ready
the cat s just let me the fuck ining the shit out of that door
that cat looks homeless is it actually your cat or a random cat appeared lol
aw kitty demands the tuna no probs kitty i demand my tuna the exact same way mainly to be an asshole though what s the kitty gremlin s name
your cat is starving do you not see how thin it is feed this baby
omg devon rex they are like feline humans and have to be with you all the time my neighbor had two of them both lived to be in their s and they were morbidly curious and affectionate such an adorable gremlin d
irl meowth or a tiny persian has that classic up to no good team rocket look
it‚Äôs not a gremlin or gizmo it‚Äôs one of the derpy looking ones between the gizmo and gremlin stage it‚Äôs a half gremlin
damn i hope you have that cat some tuna have a heart
give that poor kitty some tuna looks like she he needs some food üòÄ
you were making dinner and the guest of honor is outside how could you
that‚Äôs a terribly built harness the wheel base is way too long poor guy can barely keep from tripping in his front paws
what a gorgeous and brave pup in love but perhaps can get a new set of wheels
never saw a wild thing sorry for itself curse you human brain
loook at that hotwheel go zoooooom right into my feels
lt lt lt my year old dachshund is having back leg issues ive been designing something just like this for her
the first time i watched it i thought she kicked the wheelchair lol
the guy who d prints wheels foe handicapped dogs needs to be linked here help a pupper out
throw a motor on there with an extra wheel for stability and watch him flyyyy
is it wrong that i started singing ‚Äúdachshund races‚Äù in my head before i saw the little guy flip‚Äîand then after he recovered i started again
i really wanted to hear everybody cheer when he crossed the finish line c
a small bird will drop frozen dead from a bough without ever having felt sorry for itself
welp i m off to go sob in the corner out of sadness for that dog laterz
yeah maybe instead of pushing your dog around literally get is a good set of wheels the love and care is there obviously so the owner should be able to tell the thing is not working for this little pupper right
little brother üò≠üò≠üò≠ he‚Äôs got the heart of a champion
i would fight anything to protect this precious dog
i audibly shouted nooo when the poor pup toppled over
omg if i was there i would legit clap cheer and jump to support the brave doggo üò≠üëèüì¢
curious how dogs poop in these can they lay down wondering for my dog
that little doggo wins the little puppo is putting in all their effort
lake compounce in bristol ct i used to work the ride right next to the race such a fun day when they have all the dogs competing
pupper didn‚Äôt want to cross finish line because didn‚Äôt want race to end
wow he went so fast i couldn‚Äôt even see him he‚Äôs definitely the winner i hope he won all the prizes
you sure that pavement isn‚Äôt too hot seriously though people need to check before they take their dogs for walks
i love dachshunds but i can t support breeding them hope this lil fella has a long and hoppy life
hi guys this is my video not my dog i m just a random spectator i originally posted in dogspotting but it seems to be deleted now maybe cause it s a dog event even though it was at a human amusement park that just happened to have a dog race today dogs aren t usually allowed oh well don t really care i just wanted to share because i thought she seemed so happy amp full of energy despite her handicap in my book all the dogs here are winners her name is duchess and she came in nd in her heat against other special needs pups iirc she was the only one with a wheelchair though one of them was missing a leg this clip is after the race where she s walking back from the finish line to the start to get off the track i can t really speak to the fit of her wheelchair because i m not an expert at all but she was able to zip across the track during the race albeit not as fast as another one of the dogs but faster than she s going here i think i can confirm that she had some use of her back legs and she also looked like a senior pup idk for sure though i hope that we can keep our criticism constructive and polite regarding this issue i don t really feel good about posting this just for the owner to be insulted i m sure she s trying her best for her pup
no a paralyzed dog in an ill fitting harness that falls over is not anything resembling aww it‚Äôs just fuckin sad
jesus h christ susan this is the fucking start line you idiot no don t you turn me around i m going to the finish line with or without you and this shitty cart
someone know this dog and or woman let her know she needs a better system for super pup
if they didn t call this race the dachshund dash it was a seriously missed opportunity
jackass lady instead of parading your poor dog around get him a proper set of wheels ffs
yeah walking behind a dog isn‚Äôt a great way to make them go straight
i wonder if we kill the dog will the woman run faster
because it s obviously an older dog and his weelchair is malfunctioning
glad none of you were around to hear the sound i just made
first time i said awwww out loud while browsing this sub
this is blaze and shiloh two of the five huskies on the instagram page hu kytroop they‚Äôve been inactive for about a year now but there‚Äôs plenty of adorable content of the pack enjoy
oooohhh sure when dogs do this everyone loses their minds but when my idiot loves me this way everyone ignores his sweet side hahaha
probably the most adorable thing i ve seen all day ‚ù§
so for anyone who doesn‚Äôt know when you drink a soda the intensity of the sweetness is such overload that your brain almost immediately begins to shut down the receptors that process the happiness your brain cannot handle it and in a way takes a little bit of damage in its attempt to do so i believe that may have just happened to my brain after looking at this picture nothing else will ever look quite as sweet or make me as happy as it would‚Äôve after seeing this
hi artemis actually here to ask about that xbone controller stand though where can i find one like that d
you re definitely going to want to invest in a decoy keyboard
are you really gonna let lemon call you a fucker like that
you got the internet points first i just got a kitten that looks almost identical and is also named artemis
i had a persian cat named artemis once he was a gift from my sister to my mom my mom hated the name and renamed him charlie charlie was best cat i was really sad when he had to be put down due to cancer years wasn‚Äôt long enough
careful that little devil doesn t chew your computer rig
the graphics card look off isn‚Äôt it you sure that in the right slot
my cat growing up was artemis we called her missy usually she really took after her name sake as goddess of the hunt bats squirrels many different rodents a crow one time her favorite was presenting it still alive to someone then leaving the room good luck looks like she has personality
hey artemis you‚Äôre very impressive now what‚Äôs the cat‚Äôs name
i m honestly more distracted by your tower nice work my dude
passive aggressive flexing basically just putting everything expensive in frame
i d definitely suggest looking into some filters for that pc wouldn t want it to suck down a furball
is that an xbox elite controller and what charge station is that lad
are those fans blowing air out of the case if so as cool as it looks they are competing with your gpu for fresh air you might see some better temps if you flipped them
ypu named him after a character in a smash knockoff
my light up mouse keeps shocking me maybe it‚Äôs not safe for feeding
god i‚Äôm so stupid at first i thought the window into the modem was a window into another room i was going to comment dang what do you do op
you should really put your gpu in the first pci and not the one it s in now also turn those fans on the bottom around right now they are fighting for air with the gpu you ll see a big improvement in temps doing that ps cute cat
ahhh my fur baby shared this name he was a siamese shorthair mix who was ginormous and intimidated people with his chonkyness but he was literally like a puppy just the sweetest my boy is gone now but i wish this artemis the best and a long happy life with you ‚ô°
i didn t know the washer had a clear top oh so i thought the bird jumped in
i love how he tried to fight it at first but then the current took over
man we make the world so wonderful and fascinating for our pets
flash you have to run counter to the rotation of the tornado to stop it
random question do pet birds like this shit shit freely all over the house
anyone else think for a split second that becoming one with the spin cycle meant that he was going to fall into the spin cycle prolly just me üôà
he s a little parakeet but really he s a silly goose
yes it‚Äôs pronounced ‚Äúkye eek‚Äù but some pronounce it like ‚Äúcake‚Äù
poor bird is bored out of it s skull being cooped up inside and not out in the trees
is this this birds way of getting drunk like it‚Äôs an analog to an altered state
birbs thoughts you think you can outspin me in my house why i outta birb tippy taps birb for the win
i have that washer pretty fun to wash i just wish it didn t stop because its load is uneven so often
i would find it difficult to leave the house knowing that i could witness that instead too cute
this is sooo cute they always amaze me with their personalities üòç
no time for caution it s necessary to put the interstellar music over this
i thought the head was once giant beak on a small stocky bird
is this the same birb that dances to wouldn‚Äôt it be nice
nothing aww about this this is a beautiful bird that belongs in the wild but is trapped in this house doing stupid shit this mindless person is forcing it to do wtf is wrong with you people to encourage crap like this and also the birds wings are clipped off so it cannot fly away mf should be put in an asylum for this
i was wondering why washing machines have see thru doors
this subreddit has completely changed how i feel about birds
looks like birdie believes it has some sort of influence
the arrakeen tortoise has blue eyes due to the high concentration of melange in its environment
i m sorry you re pointing out the eyes but forgot to notice the turtle is flying
m maybe i ve never thought to check a turtle s eye color
blue eyes turtle level light normal monster atk def said to be a distant relative of the blue eyes white dragon this this turtle dreams that it can fly
i m more curious about this mysterious flying turtle
should have had a whitewalker riding him for the got final battle
i ll be real i ve never looked a turtle in the eyes before
it honestly never occurred to me that anything other than humans and australian shepherd puppies had colored eyes
looks like a moon bear asdf reference there‚Äôs a guy in my class called desmond and he‚Äôs a turtle
this turtle looks so optimistic like it s about to tell me that everything is gonna be fine and i should believe in myself
maybe but i m not sure i ve ever seen a turtle this happy
bish i own one his name is emerald yo and a happi boi
i bet someone would pay big bucks for this little blue eyed cutie to eat it
nice to see that morla made it out of the swamp of sadness
the beauty of nature surrounds us it can be found in the warmth of fall leaves morning dew on a spider web and in a weed breaking through asphalt one just needs to take a moment to really see it blue eyed turtle is one of them
anyone else immediatly think of the turtle from kungfu panda
my dog tried to do this with my week old chicks this morning lol
omg the expression on his face when the smol doggo attacks
annnnd this is why big dogs are best dogs unpredictable little shits that chihuahua s are
when my sisters malamute pats down dogs like this it s almost always to assert dominance lil guy might be just standing up for himself
omg his expression ‚Äúalright alright let‚Äôs all calm down ‚Äú is all imagine him saying
‚Äújesus fucking christ greg i was trying to be nice ‚Äù
crazy how people think the chihuahua is to blame the shiba inu was trying to assert dominance while the chihuahua took it for as long as he could
it s always the little ones you have to look out for d
not to alarm anyone but i‚Äôm sure that dog has some how learned kung fu
i feel like maybe his dew claw got the chiawa is its oversized beety eyeball
if someone had to hire a caretaker for a lemon shark i d be ther so fast
that‚Äôs a remora not a shark but they‚Äôre often found around then they have a modified dorsal fun that acts as a suction cup which they use to attach to larger animals like sharks turtles and occasionally humans this allows them to save energy because being carried around is easier than swimming they are very cute though
tried to play the most decisively victorious game of ‚Äúgot yer nose ‚Äù in history
that s not a shark it s a remote a bony fish that has a sucker on their head and often accompanies sharks
please hold still ma am i am just checking you for excess parasites that i might be able to free you of this will only take a second and you re clean
remora is secretly vulkan vulkan lives again man just wanted to boop snoot then saw the hair and decided it s better wavy
greetings i am dr drake remoray may i adhere to your body while you swim
is nobody gonna mention that she is way cuter than the shark
as someome with long but all too quickly thinning hair especially on the front with a slowly but surely increasing spot this made me wince if that shark did that to me in the same spot i d likely lose it
shark ‚Äúgirl you suit a side parting swoop that over ‚Äù
that s a remora they like to dress up in grey and hang around with real sharks
not a shark but remoras just like sharks see the flowing hair and to them it looks like torn flesh that‚Äôs why the fish is so interested in her hair it looks like scraps of flesh
we all need that one friend to sometimes help do our hair for photos
what person with long hair doesn t tie their hair back to get in the water tho
slowly rips her hair out until her hairline is recedingüòÇ
the divers name is beth neale she s a time south african freedive champion that can hold her breath for minutes
comes in here learns from comments that ‚Äúshark‚Äù is a ‚Äúremora‚Äù makes comment implying that i already had that knowledge for i am superior i‚Äôm pretty sure that this is actually what happens because there is no way that there need to be fucking comments identifying this fish
not a shark as you‚Äôve probably found out by now lol
i bet that fish knows a thousand different ways to cook shrimp
omg grrl who does your grooming let me get this patch of fuzzy stuff before it takes over oh it s so much i ll be back with my posse
bitch these bangs ain‚Äôt working for you fish probably
i ve seen them eat the floating turds when customers flush the toilet on a charter boat they re nasty
it s a cute little hair pulling jerk i ll give you that
don t take selfies in my turf or i ll rip your hair off gt o
‚Äúthats not a shark its a ramora‚Äù what‚Äôre you a bunch a fuckin ichthyologists
diver shark what interesting seaweed you have o so cute
a remora latched onto my leg once while i was scuba diving i had not seen the little guy prior to this encounter made me scream and then laugh underwater it was a very bizarre suction feeling
this is a good example on how to interact with a wildlife they touch you you don t touch them
i was scuba diving in playa del carmen some years ago and we went diving with sharks no cage or chainmail just sitting on the bottom in of water with bull sharks it was unbelievably awesome and one of these little shits bit me i was wearing a short wet suit so my legs were bare left a mark on my shin glad the sharks didn t smell blood
dude that s a ramora fish they use the plate on their head to stick to sharks
uh that s not a shark that s one of the things that you see stuck to the bottom of sharks
‚Äúgirl who did your hair here let me fix it for you ‚Äù
you look like the actress who plays the mermaid in splash lol
maybe not a shark but cookie cutter sharks are cute
okay zo first we tease de hars and then ve fluff fluff fluff dem up you look mahvelus
for all the people saying it s not a shark you re right but technically a shark does swim behind her at least i m pretty sure it s a shark
that s cute until an actual shark swims up and tries the same thing
this made me want to look at little baby sharks so i googled baby shark what a mistake that was
that fish looks like he would just chuckle all day long playing with diver s bangs
was waiting for an ear or lip to get taken off but it s a cute lil thing
"when a moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie
that s amore"
as someone who had to hear this all during the holidays and despite knowing it is a remora not a shark here is my contribution üéºbaaaaby shark do do do dooo do doo do üéº
that s a remora fish the thing on top of its head attaches to bigger fish so it can ride around on them and eat their food and stuff not a shark
anyone else impressed by how long and casually she held her breath for
that s a remora they have suction cup heads to stick to stingrays whales and usually sharks
all i could think the whole time was meep meep meep meep while it opened its mouth
poor murder fish can‚Äôt murder he‚Äôll mess up your hair though so watch yourself
ah yes the remoras of the barber y coast short back and sides please
they re great for exfoliating skin she looks years younger
the sharks just like hey hey hey hey what ya doing there hey hey what you doing
not a shark though still cute they re called remora or pilot fish they stick to sharks clean them eat extras and bacteria off sharks
i d end up drowning by not wanting to move and disturb the wee thing
as a guy approaching his ‚Äôs that fish tugging at her hair line gives me serious anxiety
cute little vid of a cute little fish with a cute little diver
it s actually trying to mate with her face the hair pulling is a dead giveaway
he s actually quite comfortable in there my dog used to get tired after seconds in the water
üíô the smooth and cool lil doggy paddle the pup is doin
what most people don‚Äôt know is that odysseus actually had to tie himself to the mast so that he wouldn‚Äôt be driven mad at the thought of not petting the good boys on a nearby island
i m saving this for the next time someone asks me how i m doing
bob bob be honest am i sinking the far side gary larson
looks like hes secretly doing the macarena dance lol
just keep floating just keep floating just keep floating
wait that‚Äôs not a golden seal that‚Äôs a doggo that good boi bamboozled me again
i think this is the first time i ve seen a dog paddle in place mine only ever went forward so he d just run me over
it s amazing how much emotion you get out of a dog clearly this dog is nonplussed he doesn t hate this but he s clearly not thrilled with his current life
careful pup if you stay in the water too long your fur falls out that s where seals come from
ahem dear santa this year i d really appreciate it if you d bring me a boingy boing boing kitten thank you
the video cut makes it look like there an endless supply of them
i think this is a sugar glider and not a lemur really enjoyed this video that is a hoppy poppy sproingy little guy
at first i thought it was a small cat and i was like what the hell i didn‚Äôt know they could do that
she looks like that grumpy year old guy seconds before he shouts at kids to get off his lawn
abyssinians are at their cutest when they‚Äôre annoyed or on the prowl you just can‚Äôt take something that small with the white markings around their mouths chins seriously
when he meows does it sound like an old man with a raspy voice assertively saying the word meow
i am very disappointed in you simba you deliberately disobeyed me and worse you put nalla in danger
such an adorably pissy kitty they look like someone just took the parking spot they were going for
she looks like that actress on orange is the new black pennsatucky‚Äôs friend you know
cats name is abernathy from a post from someone else a month ago
when you steal someone else pictures that often circulates many subs and claim it‚Äôs your friend cat hopping everyone on reddit is an idiot with no memory
she is feeling uncomfortable or waking up just now otherwise she is beautiful
is she an american eskimo she looks like my love when she was young
just a disclaimer that suki is a japanese spitz and is a female
russian here your dogs name translates to ‚Äúbitches‚Äù i assume that‚Äôs what it gets

our maine coon does the same thing but we call it serving meerkat üòÄ
my chihuahua does the same thing for food it‚Äôs adorable
our pekingese does the same only we call it swimming
my dog does this whenever he wants something i‚Äôd actually seen it before a woman i met in a brewery had trained her dogs to do it with the command ‚Äúsay your prayers ‚Äù very cute
with sound on you can hear his demanding little mrat
‚Äúcmon dad you just do your hands like this but on me‚Äù
that is the absolute cutest i wanted to reach through my screen and give him a pat too üòÇ
our puppy does this and it‚Äôs ‚Äú please‚Äù and sadly our other dogs do not know sign language
noooo are those real they remind me of then people animate and draw faces on inatimate objects seriously they re adorable in the deepest way
the only baby that comes out with a smile on their faces
the kids moved out already and it feels like i was just giving birth to them minute ago
how many pups typically result during a litter for rays
it would be aww if it wasn t sea world and this poor thing wasn t born in captivity
i didn‚Äôt know rays did live birth i thought they just laid eggs til something
come out and within seconds can swim my year old nephew forgot to walk left right left right and fell on his face its a miracle humans look after their young or we would be screwed as species
no matter how cute that lil guy is i still dont forgive him for what he did to steve irwin
this is the cleanest most painless looking live birth i ve ever seen
love discovery cove been there twice to swim with the dolphins
saw some eagle rays when i was in the bahamas those things are the size of small cars
do all rays have barbed tails or stingers or only sting rays
to bad they belong to sea world born to a life of captivityüò≠
first experience within seconds frontiers water surface
nice try cute wolf puppy ‚Äî i know to still fear for my life
i m not sure if this is a wolf puppy wolf puppies usually have a uniform dark coloring this coloring looks a bit too varied to be a wolf or at least a full wolf regardless it s freaking adorable

look i don t be negative but this wasn t cute to me mostly because traumatizing history i wrote about on r slash tales from the customer basically a bat was in my hotel room on christmas
i do have to ask what a broken finger does to a bat i don t know the anatomy of bat and would love to learn more
there are so many posts on reddit of alleged wildlife rehabers being inappropriate with the animals they re taking care of the more you interact with the animal the more it associates humans with food and safety and the less likely it is to survive in the wild they can t be released if they re attached to you at my wildlife hospital many of the senior leadership had to take animals home because staff had been too affectionate with them and they were unable to be released i know it s cute and i am sorry to post a downer like this but i truly think treating wild animals like this is unethical
last year these heartless people in my school and grade threw rocks at a bat and one of the teachers saved it don t know if they re well now or not here but those heartless people threw rocks at it poor thing
momma cat is probably thinking mmm my baby is so soft and smells nice but also could you fucking stay still and sleep please mommy not ready to be up yet or is that just me as a mom
just the same as when hubs puts baby on the bed in the morning only baby straight up pummels me all morning with his new found arm control
‚Äúi know that carl i wasn‚Äôt born yesterday oh wait ‚Äù
hes in the red team he is not an ally of blu and should be punished
hello world cleopatra is gonna be a very good and very cute programmer when she grows up üòç
how is it that baby animals have so much motor function after birth yet we‚Äôre all soggy little potatoes at birth
they let just anybody have a reddit account these days don t they
i hear that if it was a boy they would have called it llarry
i call bullshit nobody one day old could possibly figure out how to post pictures of themselves on the internet you are a liar sir
actually that was a full on takedown attempt you‚Äôre lucky to be alive
how did you walk away so passively after an attempted murder
then why didn t you fall over in fear give that little guy some credit
we all know that you were left terrified after that
haha i live the little peek before you arrive like oh he s coming he didn t see me this is going to be so good rawr
when they do this you have to act like they really spooked you or they will feel like they did a bad job
ur supposed to jump up in the air feet like he got ya to boost his confidence
guys we did not see op s face probably full of fear
you didn‚Äôt even act scared come one man you‚Äôre gonna hurt his feelings
last footage of a man getting jump by a hired killer
the only reason why he didnt jump or run in fear is because he got paralyzed
my cat does that too sometimes i‚Äôll act like he got me and let him crawl around on me like holy shit i can‚Äôt believe that worked
aww my kitten does that i love it when he does that
at least try to act scared you ve gotta keep the kids hopes high
is that your ethernet wire i tape my along the base of the wall oh ya and watch out for that lil shit
did you go to the police you got away without a scratch
this guy literally so lucky how do you manage to escape an attack like that wow just wow
you re supposed to pretend to be startled to reinforce it s predatory behaviour
you‚Äôre gonna have to have that feral beast put down five feet higher and three feet closer and he would have severed your jugular
op you didn t scream the lil guy scared you it s part of his training
a hunters first footsteps you go little get em with your little murder mittens young one
i had a little ankle grabber like that as a teen i loved it when she did this
you shouldve acted like you died then look at her reaction
in my house we call this the surprise motherfucker our cat just left kittenhood so we don t get surprise motherfuckered much anymore though
i feel like i just watched a scene from pokemon snap
bes is that you i assume not if not this video is from a turkish guy called bes on twitter stop pretending
oh come on man at least pretend like he got you that s ice cold
artyom protecc motherland as per comrade boris instructions
acknowledge the pounce baby cat expended all his energy trying to take you down
got my first cat a few years ago and was totally shocked and pleased by this behavior it s so funny i love encouraging my kitty when she surprises me from behind a door
my cat does this too except she s a large year old cat that isn t cute you see her peaking around the corner like the fucking idiot she is
oh boy here they come ima scare them so good meow roar ha i scared you so good
my giant maine coon does this everyday and it actually scares the crap out of me
i typically avoid cats because i m super allergic to them but oh my goodness i would let this sweet baby sneak attack me any day ‚ù§
they should ve jumped up in the air as if they were startled for positive mental reinforcement cats including lions actually do this with their cubs
seriously you ve gotta play along with the game and act startled jump
my lil guy she s and a half a few years ago i was walking home from marley and me thinking cats are shit why don t i have a dog at least they care we live on a corner house as i walked around i could see her she saw me she ran and hid and did something similar as i turned the corner into the drive my own lil mad marley lady
the little head rest at the end made me squeal in glee
i wish there was audio original video was posted on instagram by wat ki
we don t deserve doggos they will love unconditionally forever
"my name is wat i sadden kiko
my mama told me to love kiko i hug him tight with all my doggy might i love you kiko inspiration from u snickerdoodle"
did you just steal these and repost it without even the sound
white dog is well trained and the other one terrified
totally not coerced by the owner behind camera or anything
every time i see one of these videos it looks like a hostage video to me all i can see in the dogs faces is ‚Äúis this right is this what you want am i a good boy ‚Äù
this is nice when it happens naturally on command it sort of loses its magic
anyone else see that they‚Äôre trained and they don‚Äôt look happy
i dont have a heart anymore it cracked looking at this
hey it s the video i saw yesterday now without sound
good boi no great boi no what is he he is the best boi
the deleted scenes from the new aladdin movie look great
when you accidentally step on your dog‚Äôs paw and you have to make it up to him all day
i‚Äôm interested in converting to this religion if possible
your kitteh and your uggs are polar opposites on the cuteness spectrum
i spent seconds trying to figure out what was in the orange circle at the top before i realized it was a shoelace and noticed the cat
well wheres the kitten talk about your kitten and only show us shoes smh
i thought of saying ‚Äúi cant decide which is cuter‚Äù but we all know it‚Äôs the pancake
i was looking at this with a cockatiel on my chest i tried to show him the picture and he attacked my face just to show me who was boss what a jerk
when i was really little my dad would make me a baby pancake after he made all the other pancakes that shows how much you love your little dude you made him a baby pancake lt
that made my day it took until pm but thank you i believe people are sometimes awesome in profound ways and today that is you
this is actually my favorite picture on the internet
‚Äúhere are your pancakes son ‚Äù üò≠ i really want a bird and now this makes me want one even more
we used to call those kitty pancakes because our cat liked pancakes
i thought you fried it s egg and fed it to the bird
i honestly thought it was a allen‚Äôs peaches and cream lollie until i read the title
pancakes made with eggs you now thats kinda like cooking his cousin right whats next chicken
we used to feed our cockatiel tiny pancakes when we made them too
it took me ages to see the cockatiel i saw a massive duck s head and the beak just touching the pancake
this reminded me an episode of oggy and the cockroaches instead of mini pies it s mini pancakes oh god the nostalgia
i was trying ti fugure out why this is so satisfying i thinj its the mostly empty pan
my brain had a hard time processing a weird duck with one cartoon eye and a strange tipped beak
that must be why they say eat like a bird because my cat eats a full size pancake
for some unknown reason before i really looked at the picture i thought the bird was a turtle
i used to make mini pancakes for my rat and also little fried eggs out of my doves eggs
my bird wouldn t even give me the chance to hand him the pancake
this is adorable but i was legit trying to figure out what kind of weird deformed duck it was before i noticed the actual tiny beak
why did i think that it was a hawk i saw the body as the head and the head as the beak
i m no pancake expert but don t you need eggs to make pancakes and don t birds come from eggs
anytime i make pancakes i always make one for my doggo just the right size tho i call it baby cakes
i can t see that as a pancake isn t it just a haribo egg or am i stupid
i never knew tardigrades like pancakes puts glasses on oh
i‚Äôve also made some of these for my tiel based on this image he loves them
hey how do i make mini pancakes i thing my birdo would like such a surprise
my dad had a few of those birds and they sucked ass then again my dad sucked ass i came here to say the bird sucked ass but it probably wasn t the birds fault now i suck ass fuck
maybe i just need to go to bed but i seriously thought that was some kind of deformed dog for at least seconds of serious inspection
cute took me a minute to realize i was looking at a small bird and not a closeup of a duck
aren‚Äôt pancakes made out of egg is that cannibalism
i genuinely thought it was an eagle and the whole head was the beak
i got baby cake too my sister made herself a bigger one about x the size of mine
if they made a pancake cereal like french toast crunch it would look exactly like that that‚Äôs the perfect looking pancake
awww this brought me back my parents used to make bird pancakes growing up for my cockatiel he loved them
i was looking at this with a cockatiel on my chest i tried to show him the picture and he attacked my face just to show me who was boss what a jerk
if there ever comes a time that i don‚Äôt smile at this someone take me to a mental institution
blenheim cavaliers are just too cute my boy gizmo lived to be such a sweet and gentle breed
my cav is snoring at my feet right now they‚Äôre the best enjoy
my brother has one of these it is literally crazy spins circles hoping something will move so it can chase it doesn t pay any attention to any other dog all it does it spins circles and move to new areas to spin if you hold her she is fine and she is super sweet just nuts
dead serious have him hang out with girls so he pees sitting down my in laws have one and he s constantly pissing on himself only after a few years they found out that the males are usually trained to pee like girls for this very reason otherwise they stink to high heaven
beautiful dog next time maybe they could rescue a dog that really needs a home and give all that money they spent on an expensive breed to the shelter just a thought
cavaliers are the best my sweet boy just passed a few weeks ago and i miss him dearly i have another cavalier who is just as lovely the best breed in my very biased opinion
this is my first post on reddit and i had no idea it would blow up like this thanks for the love everyone i‚Äôm excited to tell my parents their pup is internet famous his name is ziggy his older sibling is bowie
congrats great dogs i have boy and a girl and they are wonderful pets
oh no i m really scared help there s a peck here with an acorn and he s pointing it at me
fantastic photograph even better keetyy smol teenny floof is purfect
very interesting story time imo my girlfriend at the time and i were looking to adopt two kittens we found a litter of three potentials and took a trip to canada bc to visit we adopted two of them an the third was named willow she looked just like this kitten those are also the exact same shoes i m wearing right now if our adoption wasn t a couple years ago i d think these were the same little floof
do you drive around with a bunch of plants in your car
what about the potted plants you have there they look unruly don‚Äôt put it past them to jump out
aww poor guy were you at a rest stop or something when he escaped it‚Äôs very lucky no one took him and he didn‚Äôt run away
you are very very very lucky to have got him back and vice versa
good luck with the rest of the move moving with pets is hard i had a cat escape his carrier on a plane once nowhere near as scary as your experience
it s almost as if people recommend keeping cats in a carrier to prevent bullshit like this
if you used a carrier you wouldn t have needed to trek through the desert
you are lucky he was not chomped on by a fox coyote or wolf the desert is full of them
oh i can‚Äôt even imagine how sad you were i‚Äôm terrified of this happening and the farthest i‚Äôve ever driven mine is across town when we moved i‚Äôm so glad he was ok and found so easily you two stay safe and close
did he come running back to the car as soon as he saw it
i skipped the story because i knew my heart couldn t handle the details losing your baby especially in the middle of no where is one of the most hopeless and heartbreaking feelings ever i can t even fathom the disbelief and happiness you must have felt seeing him again waiting for you it feels like a dream keep an eye on that skittish baby you guys are truly blessed to have your baby back
oh god i literally have nightmares where this happens i m so glad you found the poor thing and he was okay he certainly won t try that again
that would have been a stressful miles the temptation to speed would have been huge
he will be your shadow forever now most likely haha
i love that he looks mildly annoyed at you for leaving him amp x b like yeah i jumped out of the car but you drove off don t think i ll forget this when it s hairball season
my cat decided to go on an adventure once on a cross country trip i hung around for about extra minutes calling his name i got him back and was so happy about it i m very happy you did the right thing you re a good human thank you for being a good person
and that s one of many reasons to secure pets in the car and don t risk their life and health
how s he supposed to jump out when you squeeze him in like that üòÇ
we found an abandoned kitten while traveling and adopted her so riding around in a car doesn t bother her i took her on a road trip the other day and couldn t find her after stopping for ice cream and the windows were down far enough that a cat could squeeze out do you know that feeling you get when both your beloved cat is gone and your wife is going to kill you she was still in the car i just couldn t see her the ice cream wasn t worth it
when going cross country with our cat we bought a harness and a leash and a cat cage with blankets to ride in having a cat under your feet or jumping out of the car at an inoppertune moment is not good we never could get the cat to do its business on a leash and he would always save it up until we were out in the middle of nowhere and explode in his cage with a terrible howling and the smell oh the smell
always made sales service calls leaving the back of my car open until years ago i found a stowaway cat an hour after i had left someone‚Äôs house
crazy that the parents offspring is so different beautiful baby
orange whos the real father brown youre as lost as i am orange brown
you and an unnamed brown tabby need to have a serious chat about her unidentified visitors
i think mom was creeping with a siamese on the low lol seriously though how
i used to have a cat that looked like a siamese except she was orange and white instead of brown and white she had two litters and both times the boys were orange tabbys and the girls were siamese markings lol
we ended up with a weird litter once too tuxedo female and a polydactyl brown grey tabby male ended up with this white thing with patches of tabby like he was all white but had splotches of daddy s tabby colors and stripes i d say calico but he had no orange and he was male a black tabby a twin to daddy and then one that looked like a seal point siamese we suspected our tuxedo male was the daddy until the twin came out and then it really confirmed who daddy was when the black tabby was born with even more toes than daddy
also had an odd kitten batch about years ago mom was an orange tabby possible known toms in the area were white with orange tabby spots or a tuxedo kitten litter had two male that were mostly orange tabby but with white legs and chest a calico with patches of orange tabby and a siamese with her cream fur that has a tinge of orange to it
it played like it was being held up at gun point lol
the stand move was completely unexpected and warmed my heart
pretty sure you could omit the cute in any post about a red panda it s implied
guy who elbowed the cameraman i don‚Äôt like that guy
red pandas are way too cute and just like your favorite house pet they ll plop down right in front of your very next step
how about nea like neapolitan ice cream cause she is just the sweetest
my first thought was that the patch on her face looks like a large eye patch so you could name her bonny after the famous pirate anne bonny
i name my pets according to their personality it ll come to you
phantom the patch on her face looks like the mask from phantom of the opera
frigg she‚Äôs got a beardy patch which kinda gives her the aura of wisdom
she reminds me of marble cake so maybe marble or cake
take the first few letters from your name and add them to the last few letters of your girlfriend and you get
she looks like my childhood cat her name was miracle
i like to use people names that aren t popular anymore named my cat doris and my dog ethel had a cat called frank before he was awesome an ex had a cat called simon he was also super cool i also think two syllable names work best i suggest francine
aw he s perfect just as he is and he s got super white teeth those are the kind of teeth you want to flaunt when you ve got an underbite
his eyes are sincere üíô i truly think he‚Äôs wonderful
i‚Äôm not going to lie and go aww you‚Äôre right he isn‚Äôt but it‚Äôs nice you love him and he loves you
he looks tuff bet he s a lover rather than a fighter though
he looks loving and up for adventure and that makes them all beautiful
look at that dapper fellow so adorable i can‚Äôt wait to have a small small dog one day
i don t know i m not sure if he s handsome in any sense of the word sound still pet and cuddle though
no one can take place of mother mother always keep her babies safe and happy
and they all have their own adorable voices too cute
toni looks supremely happy p s i love your sense of style
holy shit we have a cat named zango who looks like that except he s missing an eye his brother is named tony
i love gray tabbies always extremely cute and ferociously cuddly kittens
that s just an absolutely fucking epic pose i know i sound like a bro but it is just too good to pretend to ignore
she s adorable used to have a cat named toni she was the most adorable floof ever miss her everyday i hope your toni beings you all the joy mine did
i would imagine toni stayed in that exact position and just tipped over for a nap
be afraid toni is calling in his psychic power of the lion
good i see you put it on the solar charger immediately should be fully charged in a short amount of time the older models require a lot longer to maintain a charge o
look at that fuzzy fur congratulations on the new member of the family
when i see people post pics of their pets i am always happy that the pets have a good home i have seen my fair share of street animals and it always makes me sad
he already figured out that he s solar powered smart little guy
that s my name and i feel blessed to share a name with such a sweet girl ‚ù§
toni is really a philosopher at heart deep thoughts about existence and matter are going on in that little noggin

hahaha i m my house we call it ips impatient paw syndrome
my old girl does this when she wants out the potty dance

his nose is sandy he was definitely nosing around in the sand the cute scale just broke
where‚Äôs the beach looks wonderful and i need a vacation
don t let him fall asleep you ll never find him again
i can‚Äôt bring my dog on the beach what utopia is this you can bring a cow on the beach
imagine building your sandcastle as your innocently scooping sand into a bucket and grab a fistful of cowpie
looks like the kind of cow to yell at kids for skateboarding by her house
she should teach him to run a swiffer around and put that laundry in the basket along with the rest of it
sometimes they do that when you re not around because they want your smell it makes them feel comfortable i used to leave a used shirt with my dog whenever i left for work
definitely awww such a sweet pup maybe needs a companion pup
dog i grew up with slept in my parents laundry basket obviously smaller dog after my mother did laundry she would put some clean clothes int he basket for the dog
my cat does this i ll come into my bedroom and she ll be laying specifically on some article of clothing even if she s on the bed if there s dirty laundry on the floor that s where she s napping
my ambull does this with my shoes i can tell she s really missed me when i find shoes in the spot she was laying
two things actually three things that looks like an apartment with a great dane in it yikes props if the owner can pull it off though why did this person leave all the lights on that bugs me so much this is adorable and i wish i had a big cuddly great dane
my cat like to do this too she likes too roll around in my shirt üòÖ
that‚Äôs what i do when my boyfriend‚Äôs not with me lol
my dog used to do this i‚Äôd leave clothes on my floor so she could curl up in them
hey that s my name i m proud to sharea name with such a gentle giant
great danes are so affectionate towards their owners such gentle giants
and he‚Äôs positioned himself so he can watch the door for when the owner comes back
awww that s precious what a sweet and very good boyyy donovan is my great dane does the same type of thing only with the throw blanket that i cuddle with nightly when i m in my couch watching tv danes are very gentle and loving giants if raised properly my great dane is years old and a lb cuddle bug üòä
my dog steals all my dirty clothes and shoes if i m so work he all take shoes upstairs into the bedroom under the bed such a weirdo
donovan‚Äôs owner is out of the house before am on a saturday ‚òπÔ∏è
my male bulldog does this but specifically bras so whenever he steals one i make fun of him for being a girly dog who likes bras i m trying to shame him into being a good boy
i had a dane that would carry his own pillow room to room so if he decided to lay down he‚Äôd have a place to lay his head oh zach you were ridiculous rip buddy
my dog loves our shoes she cuddles up with them in her sister s crate and uses them as a pillow
when my human s gone away this my favrit place to lay my doggie bed upon the floor i lay on it n stare at door just one more thing i need to rest is really what i like the best a shirt that holds her special scent to cuddle with for me is meant n now at last i am all set her shirt my bed my needs are met am ready now to nap once more n dream about the open door ‚ù§Ô∏è
our dog does this too üòä it‚Äôs the sweetest thing ever on the days i make the bed i‚Äôll come home to the pillows being knocked over because he was rooting around to find one of our sleep shirts to snuggle with
i want to see the same video but him coming home from work
my cat does something similar pants hoodies hats tshirts socks anything she can find she ll plop down on and sleep when i m away
you got the species wrong this is no great dane it is a midsize calf holstein frisian to more specific their countries of origin are bordering regions so they get mixed up regularly holstein frisian are known for the strong emotional bond they build with their owner
maybe if i steal this she will come and tell me off
the owners smell feromones releases oxytocin and has a calming effect on the nerves
gentle giants indeed my friend has a great dane and the first time i saw it i was genuinely terrified by the low deep pitch of a great danes alert barking i showed fear and great danes are super smart after a little practice that big dog was legitimately the kindest dog ever
i do this for my little dude when my mom is doggie sitting i make sure to put a shirt i‚Äôve slept in with his stuff and she wraps him in it while he sleeps he loves it
i would always give my pets a shirt of mine or my son‚Äôs if they had to go to the veterinarian‚Äôs for a stay it‚Äôs so comforting for them to be with our scent when they‚Äôre stressed
my dog does this too üò≠ he‚Äôll take a shirt from my laundry and jump on my bed and place it on the pillow to sleep on it
my westie has a thing for my jodhpurs they are his preferred nesting material
my chihuahua has done this with my dirty panties adorable
i think that‚Äôs sad not cute the dog is mourning everyday poor doggy so sad
why is it that all the gteat danes i know of are mostly i door dogs
what a sweetie my dog does this with my shoes it s adorable q
i had a great dane australian shepherd mix once he was the sweetest dog i miss that boy
where does that horse poop while the owners at work
my brother in law s great dane used to do the exact same thing
my dad s husky does this steals our shoes never chews on them though just lies down next to them
this is clearly fake i don‚Äôt know a dane that doesn‚Äôt own the furniture lol source my dane and the neighbors dane‚Äôs own all the furniture
i always leave out the previous nights shirt out for the dog to sleep on while everyone‚Äôs at work
my great dane this same thing if i have clothes on the floor she ll gather them up and lay on them they are doing it cause of the scent of you
my dog does this with my underwear doesn‚Äôt chew them just cuddles them
my dog steals any boyfriends jock strap and my used towel
my sisters dog does this while her and her husband are at work lol he will grab a shoe or something and just lay with it haha
this dog needs a friend perhaps a small rescue dog or a kitten
my father‚Äôs dog does this with my socks while i‚Äôm at work when i look after her
why a great dane copped up in such a small apt selfish superficial dog owners right here
hecc karen doin me an abandonment need karen smells bout to do me a reminsice
hours alone with nothing to do but wait for your owner holy shit i d go insane
my cat does this too sometimes i throw my hoodie on the bed and that s exactly where she sleeps or in dirty clothes on the floor sweet babies
hello donovan that‚Äôs a great dane idea now you get to smell mommy‚Äôs scent all day you‚Äôre a big handsome boy donovan i‚Äôll bet you‚Äôre a great cuddler
that s a big doggo looks like scooby doo with white fur
my dog steals a sock from whoever leaves the house then cuddles it
my car sleeps on my bed in my favorite cover while i m at class i have to sleep with it because it smells like him and he has to sleep with it because it smells like me
there are two great danes that come into my vet office both owners are the tiniest women who have baby toddlers they can walk but not speak full sentences don t know what age that is these giant dogs insist on being in mom s lap the women could ride their dogs in but instead are moving their kids out of the way as the dogs plop down on their laps i love danes
he looks like i just told him a lie and he doesn t know whether to believe me or not
he looks like he s listening to every detail about your day and throwing in the appropriate uh huh that s right and no shit for real when necessary
like bruh i just thought like my eyes are they even real i feel like that dog said that at one point
i didn t just launder your million dollars i quadrupled it
i want whatever weed your dog is smoking he looks hella chill dude
my sweetest puppets is half chihuahua and just this cute
he looks like an old pervert but i mean that in a nice way
by joy do you mean drugs because he looks like your go to dealer
thanks pictures of dogs that look high af are my absolute favorite
his pupils are so dilated you can barely see the color of his eyes he‚Äôs a very happy dog
he looks like he just shit in your shoe and is waiting for you to stick your foot in karen
hey man can i have one of those um what are they called oh yeah treats
he looks like that dying inside meme guy harold in dog form
he looks like he knows where to get the dankest chronic
kinda looks lile adrubk guy trying to pick up ladies
looks like he s looking into my soul while being a therapist and how does that make you feel
that dig knows what your girl stuck up your butt last night
hahahah he looks like a mob boss like yea thats nice but i m not impressed what else you got for me
heh i dont usually make my hooman smile but when i do i my hooman tons of joy
looks so much like ren from ren and stimpy with those wincey lil eyes
he looks like he just released a mega fart so happy and mischievous
he looks like me waking up like ah shit here we go again
your dog looks like it‚Äôs on drugs and i think i‚Äôm okay with that
he looks like he knows a secret and is not sharing üòÇ
your dog looks like he hid the body with the cocaine
that is a super relaxed looking handsome good boy üíñ
cute little fellow he looks a little bit like don rickles
he s amazing i think he s the dog version of steve buscemi but in a cute way
he looks like he just farted and you haven‚Äôt smelled it yet
i feel like he would be running a store in a dnd campaign
thx for sharing just one look at this handsome boy tells you he has a very positive disposition i especially like his ear to ear smile he has a look that seems to say ‚Äúi‚Äôve got a secret ‚Äù cheers
what mix is he i have a chihuahua crossed with unknown breed and he looks just like this down to the white chest line
looks like a small airplane coming in for a landing at a remote airfield cheers
i want to see the person who threw that stick that far
fake look at the right side of the stick it goes inside the ground
anyone else here the hawaii five o intro from that dogs footsteps
‚Äúspeak softly but carry a big stick‚Äù missed caption opportunity
looks like a plane coming in for a landing on a windy day
and this is why in my clinic i m more concerned about an aggressive staffie than an aggressive chihuahua
fake you can literally see the right side of the branch dip inside of the ground at one point
my name is dog i like to slep and when i do i also blep
she can divide the room with just the blink of an eye
bobalu and bobo you can call the girl if there is one lulu or bob
he already killed all his other toys he just found a new victim
i love how he s the tiniest bit cross eyed in this picture
one of my cats plays with two fabric scraps if we d known when we got him we d have named him tony stark
yup ppl spend tons of money on pet toys yet they‚Äôre more than content with a sponge box paper bag who woulda thunk it
but did you buy him his own sponge if not he obviously didn t have all the toys he needed seriously they always want anything they don t have
don t know why but my cat loves to steal the sponge as well you ve got loads of toys
i brought ear plugs home and my two cats are having fun with them
oh my god look at his dumb fuckin face i want to pet him forever
my cat always rejects toys after a few days so after seeing this i decided to put a sponge next to her she seems to like it thanks
our cats favourite toys are rolled up grocery receipts
it‚Äôs just like when you buy your toddler some top of the line toy and they just want to play with the box wrapping paper
awe he‚Äôs adorable of coarse he wants the sponge typical love the crossed eyes
gorgeous kitty they like such odd things sometimes mine won‚Äôt let me file my nails with an emory board she takes it away from me every time and keeps it
i ve never seen anything cuter why can t i upvote this more
you know the first thing that goober is going to do when getting home is roll around on the bed
aww my ass i ll be more pissed that i have to clean the dog and anything it touches on the way home some mud stink too the dog is aww but the action is no
my dog was always doing this took ages to get him clean
if he s not supposed to play in it then why is it even there
my dog has never showed interest in mud we go to the dog park a day after it stormed most of it was dry except for a couple mud pits in the corner wife ‚Äúhey make sure she doesn‚Äôt go near the mud‚Äù me ‚Äúshe has never gone into mud she‚Äôs fine‚Äù seconds later dog is rolling in mud pit
why do i have sudden craving for chocolate dipped lady fingers
and this is why i don‚Äôt own pets my girlfriend already does this enough
my sandy does this exact same thing i have a cover on the back seat of my car for times like this
what is it with goldens and finding the most disgusting substances to roll in
my favorite flavor peanut butter with chocolate swirls cute
when you get home dog thinks whit a smug smile time to go to hoomans bed
then you take the dog for a nice room temperature water bath with clean water and he acts like you re dipping him in acid
is there a reason some dogs animals do this i thought it was personality wise but maybe it‚Äôs from evolution
someone s getting the hose turned on them when they get home
i‚Äôm not sure what it is but goldens love the mud every time i go to the dog park the only place i see goldens is in the mud pits
ya ll don t see the tennis ball he s trying to play fetch
yeah he s totally a keeper the dog and the boyfriend
according to my husband our dog cries ‚Äúmom‚Äù when i leave i‚Äôm not buying it i just hear her howl
i‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs been asked a million times but do know what this means for when dogs try to copy us when we‚Äôre ‚Äútalking‚Äù to them
not to be dramatic but i would literally die for asher
this is the cutest thing ive ever seen in my life car alarm nose
well that s way better than teaching him to do the nazi roman salute
aww this reminds me of the meeshka i love you meeshka meeshka video
i think he‚Äôs actually saying ‚Äúwhere are my balls summer ‚Äù
the sound went off on my computer but i can read his lips
at the end it sounds more like he s saying i knowww
my great aunt had a dog that would say i love you and open the door i was like and they left me alone with it for a little while to adult outside or whatever i forgot about being told of it s talents i was reading a book when i hear a demonic scooby doo voice roopen the dohr sounded like one of those neck talking devices the second request was followed by scratching on the door and i realized holy shit they weren t kidding as i opened the door and let it outside i ll never forget that voice üòÇ
my husband s old senile cat would sit in the middle of the dark living room in the middle of the night and and loudly yell helooo like she had just woken up and had no clue who or where she was lol
sounds like his voice is cracking at time i didn‚Äôt know dogs can have that happen to them that‚Äôs adorable
looks like a deleted scene from homeward bound sassy strikes back
how adorable ‚ô•Ô∏è hahaha i wish our golden did this with our cat he is a bully
goddamn it karen someday i won t be here to save your ass
oh c mon cat ignore that fren you wanna start a fight again why you gotta do the stalk why can t you two be nice n talk come sit with us here on the stair we your frens for you we care make new frens n keep the old one is silver but we your gold
where is the audio original audio had the owner asking the dog to break up the fight
there s a video of a cat getting dragged away from another kitty indoors by a golden same
i know you can win that doesn t mean you should fight them but remember those scratches you got last time it just ain t worth it zoe or other cats are friends not your enemy they aremy enemies this is my territory do you see me and doug fight no because others aren t enemies zoe come on now
dog was saying the cat that it is not the time of pray and you should come back
cat is a female who met a cute guy who wears hats in all his pictures retriever is the females best friend
wow i knew cats and dogs can get freaky but this is downright loving
dog pulls crazycat ‚Äúwhat are you doing i‚Äôm ‚Äù dog ‚Äúthese are the streets you don‚Äôt want that smoke ‚Äù dog continues pulling crazy cat to safety
i don t understand how the people would want to keep the puppies and separate them from the mom normally it s the other way around at least when the puppies get old enough to give away that poor mama such a sweet video
this sweet mama dog was sooo happy to get her babies back but what i really love is how at the end she thanked the human who helped her so touching
you can see how thankful she is too when she nuzzles her head with the vet
shame on that ‚Äúowner‚Äù i hope she is never allowed to own another living thing
shame on the owner of the dog you just don t do this to your dog wonderful to see this mama so happy that she got her babies back and being grateful to the person who brought them back
i‚Äôve seen this before but not with the same story in the original one i saw it was medical related the separation
i literally live down the road from that shelter i am deeply disappointed and disgusted that my community could even think of trying to separate this mum from her pups but at least they were reunited but still for the person who did this i will probably pass u on the street tomo so just for u it s time for a fucking crusade
this is really cute but it bothers me every time when someone says furry family the internet is responsible for that
thank you for being good there are good people out there
try to understand the feelings of dogs mother don t want to live separately therefore let her allow to live with her cute babies whole the time
i wonder what they did to get the puppies it s very likely that pos owner made them buy the puppies
humans are garbage period not all tho good job from the people from the shelter
how did they convince the owner to part with the pups
so this is good but how did they know the dog was upset about not having it‚Äôs puppies how did they know who the owner was and how did they just go to the owners and take the puppies this type of stories are always confusing to me
shes so sad without them and so happy when they re back this is what the dairy industry does to cows and why i find it disgusting
i love the this is mine and this one is mine i made that one too just her excitement is so real glad this story had a happy ending
thank goodness this had captions i wouldn t ve been able to tell that the dog was sniffing her pups and was then overjoyed
things like this won t stop until we stop buying from breeders and puppy mills we are past of the problem we can be part of the solution adopt strictly from shelters
why the fuck are there still not stricter rules in loads of countries for owning and breeding with dogs
poor baby girl makes my heart scream so much love i m so glad that they could reunited üòçüòçüòç
real question is what actions were taken against the owner
imagine being so unbelievably cruel as to not only take a mother away from her children but remove her from the only home she knows
so i try to be a hardware but clips like this turn me into a little marshmallow
the mother is clearly trying to get away in the end s
we had a dog in the area that had given birth to a litter of pups in the community we ve been pushing people to adopt these dogs rather than buy from breeders so gradually people came and picked up the pups one by one however one of the pups was brought back in a few days probably because the person didn t want it initially the mother and pup smelt each other and once the recognition came they started wagging the tails furiously and the pup tried to latch on to the mother to feed it was great to see the bond between mother and child
now i never want to get a puppy knowing that it hurts the mom this bad
every time i see posts like this i get reminded how low inhumane people can be thanks for sharing
stop treating dogs like products they are living beings with emotions
so the owner decided to ditch the mum did anyone ditch the owner
wonderful human for doing this taking time to care wish the world had more like her it would be a better place
this is pretty much the best thing to see first thing in the morning
yeah sure momma dog is excited and happy today but give her hours of those little milk suckers constantly trying to feed from her and climbing all over her and not letting her get any rest and she ll be begging the shelter to take them back just kidding i think it s an awesome story but i did think that the bloom may be off the rose after a day or two
usually i can‚Äôt stand the fluffy crap pushed to the top at this sub but this was damn wholesome
i worked at a pet shop in hs and they were really greedy and did some disreputable things for money imo but one thing they did well is that they refused to sell puppies even though there is a lot of money to be made from it they kept a list of puppy breeders in the area and told people to go there and check out the facilities for themselves before getting a dog to make sure it wasn t a puppy mill and to consider shelter dogs as well
happy birthday take care of your friend till the next date of birth

this is a beautiful picture but i really wanted to hear it
i can almost tell it s a ginger cat ginger cats are the best
best thing i seen today thank you for making this happen
surely that kitten is way too young to be handled and should be left with its mum
all i can think is please leave the new kitten with its parent where it belongs
i opened reddit to see something cute surpassed hopes swooning
the o comes later in life to be correct that would be the first mew
my mama cat just had babies last night i was in the bathroom and heard the distinct meow and ran to the room we now have cats in this house that might be a bit much naaaaaaaa
"cat yawns
everyone awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww"
i can almost imagine some beautiful opera singing coming from that tiny kitten
mine never stopped once he started damnit i never relished this moment
i too am not a bit tamed‚Äîi too am untranslatable i sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world walt whitman
i can just imagine the cuteness of that little squeak
more like reeeeeeeeeeee what the internet has done to me
i would totally hang this on my wall beautiful photo my heart is squealing
it s not like i ve seen this image a million times or anything
that is the smallest kitten i think i‚Äôve ever seen how the frick is it so tiny and adorable i want one
this is my favorite photo on reddit just makes my heart melt ‚ù§
cat looks like those screaming cowboys from the meme lol
"first meow other cats meow
my cat s first meow aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhggggghhh"
such a breathtaking picture and undeniably cute as well thanks for sharing
such a beautiful picture in black and white would have liked to hear the meow
me after waking up from a short nap hours later dehydrated and wondering what year it is colorized
kindly close the door ‚Äî can‚Äôt you see that we‚Äôre bathing‚ÄΩ adorable ‚ò∫Ô∏è
mom s look a the end look somewhere else you creep xd
i have outdoor cats the mom will bring the kittens chipmunks after she breaks their back legs to teach them how to hunt
please keep reposting this until the end of fucking time
one time our adult female cat brought a live mouse in from the garage and set it on the floor in front of two kittens we had that weren t even related to her she just dropped it on the floor and sat back and watched as i taught the kittens how to catch a mouse
next lesson how to purr to make the hoomans love you
mom cat she saw the ritual gather up the folks we re going in tonight for the hunt
this is actually really important i once had a cat who had kittens but unfortunately died when they were weeks old they didn t really have any cats to teach them how to be cats and were all pretty messed up socially and behaviorally despite our human best efforts
when my cat had kittens at that age she was firmly into swat you re done get out of here i need to get on with the next batch
me and my mom but they realy mimic their mom unlike me
i m a teacher and i wish human parents taught their kids to clean themselves as well
this is another example of why it s wrong to separate kittens or puppies from their mothers before they re weaned amp have had a chance to learn all the things mothers need to teach their offspring
i‚Äôm jealous of the way cats cuddle it so uncomfortable to cuddle as a human shape boney points and then limbs falling asleep lol cats also look super comfortable when they are cuddling
theyre just acting cuddly so you dont know what scheme theyre cooking up the one on the left looks particularly scheme y i bet he is the mastermind
my cats were on the same sofa the other day and i was shocked and happy ten years together and they still barely tolerate each other
this kinda looks like when you catch two siblings fighting and they try to play it off sib no ma we were just hugging right marcus sib can‚Äôt breathe
you bet we love all of those who love it‚Äôs interesting you have to give love to receive love so cool
i definitely enjoyed that picture they look adorable all cuddled up like that
i wish i could hear the sounds that other people make when they see this picture i personally made a groan that ended in kind of a squeal it is just that freaking cute
at first glance i thought this was just one extra wide floofer
my cats do this constantly and hate it when i join in
the thumbnail made them look like one really fat cat
deserves a nd up vote just for the solid choice of tshirt
the poor little tacker is going to be confused when the teacher scolds him for writing his s backwards
if this was for the child the number would be the other way this is for internet points and to show they have a happy disabled son well yeah he should be happy you don t need to gloat your son is happy even though he has downsyndrome
omfg what a freakin cutie the pure joy in that face
kid is thinking best day ever parents are thinking second best day ever
don‚Äôt forget when watching this adorable video that down‚Äôs syndrome is being eradicated through selective abortion w rates of us france denmark iceland this is genocide
the gif that almost convinced me to have kids nice try baby american jesus nice try
my god that is pure happiness why do we lose this in our old age
is weeks too late for an abortion in this case probably not
this smile that s joy ladies and gentlemen my heart s still melting tut
the quality got a bit worse since this wqs last posted
my heart melted hope he she had a wonderful birthday‚ù§Ô∏è
i keep seeing people with similar faces to this little kid why is it like a family thing or a race thing
ohmigosh kisses kisses and more kisses to her brightened my day she did
legit question why do so many people with developmental disorders look so similar like their facial features
everyone saying how cute this is and all i see is the birth of a pyromaniac
such a beautiful smile adorable little girl she is blessing keep those smiles coming üòã
meanwhile me when i was a child when i was like friends asked if they can come over to my party i asked my mom if i could have friends over for my birthday and she basically told me that there s nothing to celebrate and if i really want to celebrate i can do so outside in the forrest now birthdays give me anxiety and every birthday i stay in my room remind myself that i m useless and no one likes me and cry until i fall asleep
what if i told you he was embarrassed and did not enjoy that at all but made it through just to make expectations
that s adorable having a kid softened me up so much
people down here in the south enjoy a cold glass of sweet three
there is just nothing better than a child who is full of happiness üò´üòç this video is exactly what i needed today
the bags under this kid s eyes make them look like they haven t been sleeping well for weeks
oml my younger sister has down s as well its so nice to see this here
happy birthday little man keep showing the world how awesome you are
oh goodness that smile is extremely contagious love the little hand covering that happened too god kids are cute
that s a beautiful would all human life is precious and deserves to be protected
honest question who s life is better hers or mine people with ds seem to be very happy i m not suggesting they don t have additional struggles living with ds but people without ds also have struggles of their own i guess i m asking is it better to be naive but happy or aware and depressed
oh my that baby is precious the pure happiness in that smile is wonderful
i often wonder what it would have felt like to feel love growing up
i was thinking caramel for the ginger can t think of a good one for the other kitty
hopscotch brown and pip orange they re weird i know it was just the first thing that popped in my head when i saw them
it seems that you interrupted ferdinand in a private moment
it was weird enough and then he did the twist ninja move with bonus crazy eyes
reminds me of the transformers from the live action movies just jumping and twirling to transform this is cuter though
he s like oh right i m supposed to be a cat transfoooorm
just go to your local shelter and sign up to foster you will see tons of sweet bottle babies like this who need love
took home a stray myself last march she hates me she spends of her time in a box this morning she cut me when i tried to pat her later she did briefly come out but that was to steal my little boy s ham sandwich while he wasn t guarding it
my family are not cat people we ve rescued mine i ve had for ish years and have now recently spent at least k on get bills damn cat nd we found as a kitten and she was cute so we kept her rd my dad found running through traffic in the city we named her dodger and the th was an older cat but was starving and such a sweet boy and now my gf has him ugh no more they are cute though but my allergies
i was kinda hoping the last frame was him putting him back next to the pole s
well no one is stopping you guys to go out there and do the same thing lol
i think the vast majority of people who see a soaking wet abandoned kitten would do exactly what this person did it s compassion toward others of our own species that is lacking
in shanghai there s so many cats dumped on the elevated highway that there s a dedicated team of rescue volunteers who mobilise when one is reported you re not allowed to stop in the elevated highway so now even the workmen have nets and cages to rescue them and then they call the volunteers who then take them to the vet etc heartbreaking this needs to happen but the rescue effort at least is a step in the right direction for a country not known for its animal rights
working at a dirty factory one time and found a kitten had fallen into the oil pit herd him meowing we cleaned him up and got him to a animal shelter
it s so hearth worming to read the comments you people are so loving caring and delusional it s so cute you live in these bubbles isolated from the reality of the majority of the world
i really want to save an animal like that but i never find one which can be a good thing
we need more people like this is also insinuating we also need more animals in this situation
stray neglected cats seem to be more loving i wonder why people dislike strays so much
i don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just me but i had a kitten that i would play with her with my hands all the time she turned out to be a crazy cat that attacks out of nowhere from contented purring to drawing blood in a flash i always thought that playing with her with my hands had something to do with it
i had a similar situation with my cat i was driving one day finally left the house to go get glasses after a month of procrastination and noticed a moped swerve to miss something in the road before the driver turned to look around i followed their eyes and slowed down when i noticed a tiny black and white lump of fur on the ground i put the hazards on and approached to find an absolutely traumatized week old kitten i picked her up and took her home she ate soft food but refused formula at first she hid in the corner under the bed after a few days she would sleep on my chest now she gets separation anxiety when i take showers years may wow
is this robin spelut the outdoor areas look a lot like the places he finds cats he has a youtube channel all the videos are him helping strays from feeding them food to outright keeping some of them his youtube channel is well robin spelut
i rescued tiny kittens and one slightly older cat from a lumber yard the owners knew they were there a d just didn t care we kept one and helped rehome the others he s now my little buddy an noms my collar as a comfort thing
there s no sound in this video but i can hear that kitten purring at the end
i rescued a kitten like this when i lived in south korea she had a rough go with distemper and still deals with the effect but she s biting me right now thousands of miles from where i got her it s a great feeling to help something out everyone who can should at least try to act
no one can help everyone but one is enough well done
i remember this little kitten i took in i found it out in a park it s mother was actively avoiding it and had basically left it at first i walked up to it and it hissed a lot at me even though it was also meowing at me i turned around and ignored it just a little to see what it would do after a couple of minutes later not looking at it it had crawled over to my feet and was meowing for my attention it was not more than just weeks old so it was a little rascal the first night was pretty cold so i took it into my bed and while i was sleeping it crawled under the covers and put it s head on the pillow like a human it would proceed to that while it was with me i sorta became it s mother and would always meow for me when i wasn t there unless i wrapped it in something warm unfortunately i couldn t keep it and it was hard getting it to eat so i found a foster mom cat for it but i still miss having it crawl up on my shoulders and snuggle itself in my hoodie
idk why this person felt the need to include their personal opinion on selfie sticks though
that probably is the only exception what a cute sloth
he s totally against the selfie stick so why does he carry one around with him i wonder ü§î
you are against but happen to own and carry one with you
you have to admit sloths are probably the most chill animals in the world
that s one the greatest failed photoshop attempts ever
but but you had a selfie stick with you i don t get it cool pic though
gt accident that‚Äôs what the other cat wants you to believe
the one on the right needs to be missed traffic laws
this is what is called a sinister in car accident so catnister
you t boned me bro or was it more of a k i t maneuver
this actually audibly made me say ‚Äúawe‚Äù this sub lives up to its name yet again
you ve been hit by you ve been struck by a smooth criminal
lmao it‚Äôs like in mario kart when you‚Äôre going along all confident and some asshole comes up and gets you with a red shell üò°
that s clearly a failure to yield and it was intentional
hooman did you get the license plate number of that kit n run kitteh
am i the only person wjo can literally count the pixels on this
it‚Äôs the cat version of when humans kick another person‚Äôs back leg while they are walking
i ve seen this gif a million times i still laugh every time
it was a kit and run cat cident i ll see myself out
this cat was so rattled it didn t even attempt to clean itself and pretend it was totally non plussed by events
this made me laugh so much i have tears in my eyes üòÇ
grey cat in the middle of yeeting amp x b orange cat o o o
here i am just walking along minding my own business and boom wtf dave watch where you re going
i love the look of ummm what just happened no for real
"people are fucking twats when it comes to oh my i wasn t expecting that but i was filming just for the heck of it grow the fuck up for fucks sake
smh"
so patiently i wait my turn am hoping for the licks to earn but brother cuts me off how rude was s pose to have been my turn dude so when the pop is passed again no cautious lick from me my fren i gonna make the human laugh i chomp the heckin pop in half
i don‚Äôt know why i was expecting the whale to clap at the end üòÇüòÇüòÇ‚ù§Ô∏è
beluga whales wiggle their melon to help them fire sounds in specific directions i wonder if its trying to sing along
whenever i see videos like this of clearly intelligent animals i feel sad that they‚Äôre being kept in tanks for people to gawp at
it was rocked we are not that special i think this guy was awed by music
can sound actually penetrate that thick of glass i‚Äôd imagine it‚Äôs at least a foot thick
and that is how we learned that beluga s have no taste in music
that was really sweet poor thing was probably scared and suffocating
and in that sanitation worker‚Äôs time of greatest need the young rat returns to render aid
oh goody let‚Äôs free the flea infested vermin back on the street it‚Äôs not like they spread disease and are a huge problem in the city s
didn t know the sequel to ratatouille was live action
i m a little torn on this please read full post before the downvote on one hand it s sweet that he freed the baby since it s usually nice when living things get to keep living in addition i like rats since the tame ones can be excellent pets on the other hand street rats like this are huge pests that carry disease and are a real problem for urban areas particularly in impoverished neighbourhoods
eh on one hand dude was really nice and helped out an animal on the other just another rat infesting an already infested city
no wild rats are not cute they are disease ridden flea bags that will eat everything including you
congrats on the cats the one on the right has a smug knowing smile like ‚Äúdude didn‚Äôt i tell you the head butts and purring would work totes did ‚Äù
makes note don‚Äòt stop at the humane society you will leave with cats
oh they re just too adorable congratulations on the adoption üòä
these two are brilliant enjoy having furry friends around
well now you know what the adoption process is like ‚ò∫Ô∏è
the one on the right looks so proud almost like it won that bell
please tell me mike s last name is hat that s what my next cat is going to be named whether it is a boy or a girl
cute the kitty on the right has an oversized collar i would take it off for now until he grows into it because he might get it caught on something when you‚Äôre not home and it could be dangerous
look at those little rascals we ve got boys from the same litter and at years old lbs each they have never stopped being the playful little kittens they were when we adopted them
handsome fellas wonderful thing you did giving these two a home and they will pay you back with years of entertainment i can tell by those faces
nice you got a calendar cat mike mike mike mike what day is it
congratulations they‚Äôre perfect however those are the faces of ‚Äúi know i‚Äôm cute and i‚Äôm going to knock things over shamelessly and get away with it ‚Äù
nobody ever goes to a humane society just to check it out and not leave with a new pet congratulations these two look like they ve found a great home
tighten that collar up before your cat gets its lower jaw stuck in it and asphyxiates
i love them both but that satisfied smile on the right just straight up murdered me with cuteness
o my goodness you had to take them home they are adorable
‚Äújust looking ‚Äù famous last words at the pet shelter
they already look all settled in awesome and adorable
i‚Äôm such a sucker for human names for animals so cute
if mike were named dale instead this would be even more perfect
that one on the right has the look of emperor palpaitine good good my plan is working
i think your wife tricked you i would have fallen for that too you re a good man
is mike the one on the left he‚Äôs got an m on his lil forehead
i love how you can see their personalities in this photo
the one on the right has that look like he s thinking yes good human now i ll be able to knock all your books off of the shelves at night and sleep on your face and steal your socks to use as toys they re both super cute too
the other cat has a smug smile right away gearing up for endless mischief
i bet your wife has the same smug smile is the cat on the right the only thing i can say is well played madame
my wife pulled the same trick on me lol let s just look they are super cute
if you have any small collectibles or breakable on shelves put them away for the love of god that duo will keep your hands full for years p s if he keeps smirking like that please post more pictures the cuteness is just beyond
i went to petsmart a few days back to get some chow for my cat accidentally walked by where they keep the cats in those glass things i hate myself every time i do this and so i ve made it a point to walk around the whole store to where the cat food is or i ll just avoid getting the food from the pet store sure enough out of all the cats there one immediately saw me and started jumping up on the glass little white orange mix kitty with just one eye i froze up and just stood there staring at her she was meowing but i couldn t hear it but i knew she was meowing and like a heartless bastard i just walked away i hated myself the entire day that day for doing that i know people for some reason say don t buy from places like that but those poor cats are helpless like other cats too idk if i lived on my own and didn t need to get ok s from other people in my home i maybe would have walked out with that kitty but i m an a hole and i didn t
two cats i had growing up were named tucker and mike we had them at different times though happy adoption day
awesome cats if they are going to be outside cats i d say get a different collar as that looks like it can get snagged on stuff might just need tightening though
mike is going to steal your boy girl and your weed watch out for him amp x b here is a tip that has helped me a lot during my years of cat servitude play with their feet all the time including forcing their claws to extend my cats all sleep through nail trims
this exact thing happened to me except we left with cat not kittens
so we named cat number one tucker what should we name cat number dale dale dale dale maybe jack dale dale dale dale i don t know how about jabediah jeb the cat sounds cute dale dale dale dale i wanna saaaaaaayyyyy mohammed dale dale dale dale no i hate names that have ham in it dale dale dale dale how about vs evil dale dale dale dale we are getting close something related to that dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale mike dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale dale yes mike
you fool you fell for one of the classic blunders but for real congratulations on the adoption
the thief and his accomplice oh boy do they look like adorable trouble makers congratulations on the adoption you‚Äôre in for years of laughs snuggles and companionship with these cool dudes
gt just to see what the adoption process was like amp x b lol smoooooth your wife wanted a new pet amp x b congrats on the new family members
i did the exact same thing to my husband no one leaves empty handed haha congrats on the furbabies
omg their little short legs are too much i love them
i like how the one on the right looks super happy and relaxed now that he s in a loving home the one on the left is staring directly into my soul demanding head rubs
as i‚Äôm looking at it the one with the collar on has the cutest little smirky smile and then i look at the other one and i‚Äôm like that one has the cutest little face i wouldn‚Äôt have been able to decide either good call on getting them both totally understandable they are both adorable
the one on the right is such a stud and he knows it
first mistake don t put them on the table they can be trained not to jump up at least while your not home little paws go right from the kitty litter to up on your counters and tables thank you sincerely a germaphobe
gt just to see famous last words friend i ve adopted two dogs and a cat that way congrats
the one on the left will cave in and confess to your murder the one on the right knows he will get away with it
that one on the right is definitely smiling you are in for so much trouble and fun and love i‚Äôve got a shelter pack myself and not a day goes by i don‚Äôt laugh or feel loved by those silly cats
my wife took me up just to look and we had a long talk about how we were only going to look and i didn t want her to be disappointed because it s not like we were going to fall in love with a dog and bring it home that day she went and cleared out the back seat of the car while i took a shower we fell in love with a dog and brought her home that day
you fool you fell victim to one of the classic blunders congrats though
ok the one on the left our right is totally smiling congrats
looks like kitty on the left had a run in with badidi and is now majin kitty
good idea on getting a pair they ll keep themselves busy
oh my gosh the one on the right is smiling so cute im glad you decided to adopt siblings it seems like it is its honestly great to adopt in pairs because of all the mischeif they get into lol
that s pawsome congrats for being adopted humans i always say this whenever i see it please remove the bells from the cats the constant chime of the bell may lead to some mood problems making it stressed out
i love how the one on the right has a proud smile like the one on my son s kindergarten graduation picture
god i wish my wife and i weren t so allergic to cats
hey how come he gets the collar and the bell and i get bubkas i can get lost i can get in trouble i demand accessories
isnt the humane society a charity made up by george constanza
one on the right looks like he‚Äôd smoke you up when you‚Äôre having a bad day
one on the right is gonna be chill the one on the left trouble
holy shit these two are the cutest cats i‚Äôve ever seen
watch out for the loose collar my kitty kept trying to get the collar off half succeeded and got it stuck across her mouth apart from that congrats on the two new trouble makers
is it really that easy to adopt in the usa in the uk they do home visits and you need letter from your landlord etc before you can even look at a cat
lol just one look at them and i can tell you that the two of them are looking for trouble gratz on getting two handsome boyz
congrats on the cats or should i say con cats i‚Äôm sorry i tried trying not to sound like a debbie downer but hopefully you and your wife had thought long and hard about taking care of a pet before you got these cute little angels and didn‚Äôt get them on a whim too many times have i seen some of my friends and other people i know buy pets impulsively and didn‚Äôt even think about how much responsibility goes into taking care of a pet a couple of my friends ended up giving up their dogs as they couldn‚Äôt handle the responsibility of taking care of them didn‚Äôt have time to do so weren‚Äôt as responsible as they thought they were etc i don‚Äôt mean to sound like a parent lolol i know that you‚Äôll take good care of them
love their names may i suggest naming next female kitten tomi d
that‚Äôs how it works you see those faces and they suck you in little con artists this is why i‚Äôm not allowed to go to the animal shelter üòÇ we already have four animals
mike is happy because his head mark actually stands for something other cat feels cheated
the one on the right is like ‚Äúoh yeah i got adopted‚Äù
oh my lord it s not a good strategy to pass by aww when you ve drank a lot of wine i just wanna cry looking at those two lt
don t know if i m being an asshole or just haven t had coffee yet but do people really make snap decisions like this i m assuming it s just the titled and op had already discussed what getting a pet would entail i would hope a pet is never an impulse adoption decision
he on the right that is a million dollar smile not a homicidal cat smile either a good boy
if you don t know already they are at least part maine coone cats amazingggg cats be prepared for them to get much larger you can tell by their m on the forehead and large paws
look at their smiles they know they have their new family so pure
ahh the kittens face on the right he looks so pleased with himself so cute
omg the one on right with the smirk classic so cute
lol they saw you coming a mile away i bet moment you walked i the door they were like get the kittens ready to leave
same thing happened to my girlfriend and i didn t even have litter boxes or food or anything enjoy your little brain parasites you won t regret it üòä
two male cats be prepared to have your house smell like piss
this is the second pet named mike that i ve seen on reddit today after never meeting or seeing an animal anywhere named mike
and from now until forever because they look the same you will both be calling them by their wrong names and wondering which one just flew past you etc my wife and i are always having this exchange which one was that i duuno cat
can t believe you fell for that from the wife so cute and glad ya did reminds me of when my dad called me and said your mom is in checking on tv prices does she have your card oh yeah she s going to get a tv dad no she‚Äîoh my god she did it duh
congratulations i have a cat named mike too michael when he s in trouble
i‚Äôm assuming mike is on the left look how smug that look is time to find my scratching post on the couch
they ve got a real pinky and the brain vibe goin for them at least that what it seems to me
make sure that collar is stretchy it‚Äôs important that it comes off if it gets caught while they‚Äôre falling out of a tree
you missed an opportunity to name one of them tyson it s not too late to change it
the one on the right looks like a born troublemaker grats on the adoption
pinky and the brain cat version you know you totally fell for the i just wanna see what s there line right lol two of you were going to adopt some cats today only one of you knew about it
maybe one day they‚Äôll grow into their ears but if they don‚Äôt it‚Äôs ok because they are supremely adorable
after week she wouldn t care anymore and it would be only your responsability
my cat buddy tucker passed away about a month ago i hope your tucker gives you many years of cuddles and purrs like mine did
i love tortoiseshells the m always reminds me of vegeta letting babidi curse turn him
mike has a cheesy smile going on i like it unfortunately my rescue has resting bitch face still love her though
they look awesome congratulations on the new additions to your family
yeah and frat bois just put the tip in so you know what it s like
i m assuming mike is on the right his smile is gorgeous both are really cute
the right one looks like he smoked some really mellow dope
my husband could‚Äôve told you that was going to happen
look at those smiles welcome to the wonderful world of cats
mike looks like he s up to no good and tucker is just following along
aaaw mike has his initial on his face tucker on the other hand has a random m
"btw very smart to get cats
so they ll be content even while you both are at work make sure to fix them as per vet agency guidelines"
so great that you got two i have two cats that were rescued together they are still best buddies and they turn yrs old in august
was it a ‚Äúbogo‚Äù when i went for only one kitten the lady helping me whispered into my ear ‚Äú we can do a bogo ‚Äù so in turn doug and goose came home to meet duck yes the three cats are duck doug and goose
tucker is adorable and mike looks so chill congrats
i‚Äôve never seen a stoner cat before but that dude on the right is high as fuck
tucker looks like that best bud who will stay beside you always and mike looks like that guy who would make you smile when you were feeling down you got some good ones
convinced you to see what the adoption process was like yeah she knew what she was doing lol congrats on the cute cats üê±
dudes expression on the left is the one i wear when i see the waiter bringing my food to my table
i want a cat so badly but my wife hates them these are adorable
little guy on the right hamming it up for the photo the left guy is in his own way too both are adorable enjoy them
watch that guy on the right he s gonna be the troublemaker
now who s to blame for that ambush the wife or the kittens
those are the cutest kitties ever congratulations and thank you for giving them a loving home
the one with the bell looks like a troublemaker congrats on the new family members
i m not a cat guy but i just made a most ungentlemanly squeaking sound they re adorable they need tiny little top hats and monocles
the one on the right mike i assume looks so smug as if he s saying see tuck told ya they wouldn t be able to resist out charm lovely lovely babies
oh mikes gonna be a little shit look at that smirk üòè
i like the way the one on the right is smiling lovely
lol your wife knew what she was doing congrats on the new kitties
awsome love dude on the right s smile he knows he has a permanent home now congratulations
i hope that they never fully grow into those ears congrats on your new instant family
the one on the right is a troublemaker the one on the left is a rule follower am i correct
one on the left looks a little suspicious the one on the right looks like it s already plotting mischief
these cats are far too pretty to have frat bro names
the little fella on the right looks really grateful so cute
i vote you change mike s name to caboose rvb would be proud
the smile on the right kitty omg so precious they are both adorable
i cannot go to the shelter i would come home with a zoo to add to what i already have
that is always a trap usually a cute cuddling one but still a trap
you don t adopt an animal the animal adopts you learned that with my cat
it‚Äôs even easier at the animal shelter i now have cats and one lb pup and zero bed space
the lil boy on the right is so happy i have a little buddy like him he smiles so sweet when he gets pet and sleeps in a little ball with his tail wrapped around him
last night i dreamt i had a cat i think it was orange and really cute white paws orange and white coat like puss in boots however i‚Äôm allergic to cats so why i‚Äôd ever own a cat is the real mystery here
you can just see the different personalities between the two of them and its adorable
that‚Äôs the ‚Äúlet‚Äôs just see if it fits‚Äù line of animal adoption
who s tucker and who s mike they look like two sides of the same coin adorable
the one on the right is gonna be an asshole i can just tell
ol‚Äô mike looks like he may be a little trouble maker look at him smirking very cute
never go to the shelter to ‚Äòjust look‚Äô one time i went in looking for a kitten and ended up with a lb american bulldog one time i went in looking for a kitten and ended up with a huge older orange tabby because he was pawing at the cage door wanting me to pet him
enjoy scooping shit for the next to years i regret the day my wife convinced me to see what the adoption process was like
stopping to the adoption center ‚Äújust to look‚Äù is the biggest lie anyone has ever told
mike and tucker are completely adorable but you should remove the bell from the collar as for the cats ears it is pretty noisy and uncomfortable and that can be a really stressful experience
you can get a cat on the same day no home checks etc
i hope the one on the right is mike he looks like a mike
you should get your other cat a collar just so he doesn t feel left out just look how happy the one is compared to the other
why did you name the cat that give him a real name ‚Äúwhere all these goofy f cking boys names coming from taylor tyler jordan flynn these are not real names you want to hear a real name eddie eddie is a real name whatever happened to eddie he was here a minute ago joey and jackie and johnny and phil bobby and tommy and danny and bill what happened todd and cody and dylan and cameron and tucker hi tucker i m todd hi todd i m tucker f ck tucker tucker sucks and f ck tucker s friend kyle that s another soft name for a boy kyle soft names make soft people i ll bet you anything that ten times out of ten nicky vinnie and tony would beat the sh t out of todd kyle and tucker ‚Äù george carlin
well now you know what the adoption process is like ‚ò∫Ô∏è
the one on the right is jim smiling through the blinds
i imagine the smug looking one on the right is mike he seems like he s a mike
my wife convinced me to do the same thing yesterday and now we have a hold on a dog and an appointment to visit him on tuesday
look at the smile on the right one he is really happy
you left with your new lords and masters and a smile on the face of the tiger there was a young lady of niger who smiled as she rode on a tiger they returned from the ride with the lady inside and the smile on the face of the tiger
lol i don‚Äôt know why but i love animals with human names
wow they are so adorable just went to the shelter yesterday with a friend to help her pick out an older cat to adopt he‚Äôs such a gentle sweet boy it was sooo hard for me to not leave with a cat i want one but i live with my boyfriend in an apartment in la and we both work hours every weekday he feels we wouldn‚Äôt be able to take care of a cat i get what he means but it makes me so sad like when will i ever have time to take care of a furry friend sigh
awesome until the little derps come and steal your heart then they wake you up in the morning because they know they have a human to boss around similar to my wife
good job getting two males vs m f those brothers will keep each other entertained and probably won t fight as much as opposite genders
the one on the right has got the funniest looking smile on his face watch out for that one
don‚Äôt be fooled by the dopey happy smile on the dude on the right‚Äôs little face that‚Äôs how they sucker you into becoming slaves
oh what cuties make sure you get them kitty towers and scratchers
argh that hello world and smug i am now very loved combo my poor heart
hopefully you have strong window blinds if not go ahead and measure them out and stash some cheap ones for later
aww they have socks cats with socks are the cutest üòç are they brothers
mike the right one i assume has that troublesome shit eatin grin that says buddy you have no idea that we are in control now they re both cuties give em extra treats and tuna
i‚Äôm guessing tucker is the one with the bell and mike is bit grumpy but cute looking one
not to be dramatic but i would die for the one on the right
oh god these two look so cute i think i can adopt a couple of cats in the future good luck with your cats god bless you and your family
cat on the right is like ‚Äúyeah that‚Äôs right this is my house now ‚Äù
love their gloves and the little m‚Äôs on their foreheads
‚Äú i‚Äôll just stop and look around i‚Äôm not asking one home today‚Äù ‚Äúi just want to see how the adoption process works‚Äù they always end up as lies you will leave with a furry creature in your car
had you named them tucker amp dale they could have protected your from evil
i just wanna travel at your house and just kiss them in their little wittle foreheads
please stop putting bells on cats this is just killing the thing they re best at
ui i has i y u i yy y ui pm by ye but a nd uh k ikdikdji ks
please tell me tucker is the any one on the left and mike is the smiles on the right
op we re gonna need weekly monthly updates on these two
that smile on the right like the cat that got the cream cream of the crop of new homes
such little sweeties thank you for adopting together
i had a mike the cat best cat in the world enjoy yours
thank you for saving these lil precious babies ‚ù§Ô∏è i cannot go near a place it breaks my heart and i want them all
‚Äújust to see what the adoption process was like‚Äù‚Äî she knew what she was doing hahahaha
my local humane society is the worst group of animal hoarding lunatics i understand having a vetted process so animals don t end up in the wrong hands but they post sob stories of a cat that has been in the shelter for over a year and then deny every application
the one on the right know something and he s not telling
mike is the smiling one those names are adorbs and seem fitting
im guessing mike is on the right he looks like a mike
i want to adopt now but i‚Äôll be moving in months should i do it
if the collar is too loose they can easily hang themselves just by jumping down somewhere and getting stuck be careful
during my time as a certified adoption specialist we saw this a lot in fact i still hold the missouri state record for total number of adoptions in one weekend in our budgee division not bad huh
oh they are the cutest please keep posting pictures of them as they grow
ah i see you feel for the ol we ll just go look at the kitties we have enough willpower not to go home with any too amp x b still nearly years later and our two are still the best kitties in the whole world don t regret a second of it
your wife knew exactly what she was doing the purrfect crime
look at that smile from the kitty on the left he definitely was happy to be rescued üò∏
these cats are so freaking cute i m happy for you your wife amp these precious babies my aunt adopted two cats this past fall amp although it s been some work the one cat was a year old amp she s skittish we think she was treated poorly but the kitten my aunt wanted was calming for her so she got them both she s happy amp it s been great to watch them come out of their shells
aww such good looking cats the one on the right looks like a lot of fun
the one on the right looks so smug yeah you re stuck with me now i am the new ruler of this domain
yea that is how i ended up with my three two from a rescue and recently to help out a family who had to get rid of their pedigree cat due to devolving allergies
someone please tell me mike is the one on the left with the ‚Äúm‚Äù on his forehead
‚Äújust to see what the adoption process is like‚Äù üòÇ it‚Äôs a trap
tucker amp mike sounds like the name of a buddy cop movie congratulations
"omg they are soooooo cute
have you had kittens before i am a huge cat lover and have currently kittens are so cute for a reason extreme cat curiosity extreme stupidity from being new to life adorable unholy terrors for the first few months so very worth it"
i am apex ambush predator tucker definitely i will watch you watch me break stuff mike definitely
that line was the adoption equivalent of just putting the tip in for a second to see how it feels
i love how one is the nerdy computer guy and the other is the street smart wise guy these two will be trouble
it s physically impossible to go to a kitten adoption and leave without a fur baby i think it s like the th law of thermodynamics or something
brothers are the best ended up adopting stray brothers and best decision ever they keep each other playing when my husband amp i are too busy they teach each other how to playbfor fun and not the hurt they adore each other and hate each but refuse to be apart i love my boys and know you will too
congratulations they are adorable we got our two boys years ago they are still good buddies and care for each other two cats is the best one thing we did in addition to playing with their paws a lot and holding them is that hands are not toys any time they started playfully biting nipping scratching our hands we replaced our hand with a cat toy as adults they never bite or scratch instead if they want to let you know they dont like something they lick your hand to ask you to stop petting their belly or whatever it s real sweet
tucker and dale not mike if you haven t seen the movie yet highly recommend it slapstick funny very good way to unwind
it‚Äôs always kitties that get the front page humane society posts not so much with the puppies unfortunately
god damn is it possible to walk out and not adopt one a friend convinced me to just check out the shelter a couple months back and once i saw my cat i picked him out immediately
your wife knew what she was doing congrats on the new family members
ok ok we re gonna go see what it s like but were not getting anything ok amp x b kittens later
the one in the left is like where tf am i and the one in the right is like hellow homans
these guys are cute that collar will be gone by the end of the week üòÅ
the one on the right tells me you re in for some trouble congratulations
cats dont need collars anyway they like the silence and they usually dont let strangers pick them up to read it anyway
we all know which one is the troublemaker you can tell by the look in his eyes and the bell around his neck
the one with the bell on its collar looks like it is up to something
i volunteer amp foster those are maybe the cutest pair i ve seen you are in for a lot of fun
good you always want to take on a year commitment based on an impulse decision
please don t put bells on cats it stresses them out and stressed cats don t last long
him s name is tucker my name is mike our new owner we sure do like you see my smile i very happy because today we got new pappy
left kitty i ll pounce right kitty what the hell is pounce
just an fyi your wife totally played you also those are some adorable kittens congrats
the long story seems cute you should be thanking your wife üòä
tucker and mike cute names for cute bois which one s smiling there
i love their smiles ooooh so cute sleep with your eyes open though
neuter early pos to prevent their developing a spraying habit we did and our two orange guys are just lovely companions and hella mouse killers out of doors on our farm
that one on the right is gonna be trouble i love him
that guy on the right is a bloody character if i ever met one
i would die for tucker and mike omg how adorable are they lt
the one on the right looks like a smug little shit lol
their duo stances could only be better if they did a back to back buddy cop pose
you can already tell who the rambunctious troublemaker is going to be
don t feel bad you can renew licenses at a local shelter here went in to renew licenses came home with kitten that ll learn my hubs to send a kittenholic on an errand like that
your wife knew exactly what she was doing well played wife
they are both so cute but the one on the rights face lt
omg thy are adorable i love people that adopt animals specially cats that are my favorite animal god bless you
the cat on the right must from now on be called smug cat
they are adorable you will be so happy with your two new kids
wife wanted to see what the process was like no she didn t üòÇüòÇüòÇ
the one on the right looks like he always has some crazy plan and the one on the left looks like the cautious voice of reason that gets dragged in every time
i just can‚Äôt ever go there i have rescue dogs right now a crazy great dane and a mastiff i know for sure that i‚Äôd def have to bring the one on the right home for sure that grin love them both
and this is why i don t go in to look i can t take care of any pets right now and i know won t be able to leave without at least one if i visited a dog shelter i d leave with three for sure i just can t leave them alone all day that d be cruel but man i wish i could just play with a few puppies once a week without feeling the need to take them home
yeah thaaaaat s why she definitely didn t have other plans lol
i ve just looked a few times we re at cats one passed to fip and a dog currently and two fish tanks i m terrible at not bringing things home
when i went into the adoption for one cat i came out with two cats when i was holding eugene they just brought over penelope my other cat and said ‚Äúthese two would be great together‚Äù
is tucker the one who looks like they re about to pounce
the one on the right looks smug as heck üòÜ they re adorable though i m sure they ll be very happy with you ‚ù§
i fell for the old let s go look at what s at the animal shelter gag once once
tucker rhymes with fucker tucker carlson you should think twice abut that one while they‚Äôre still new the name triggers a nausea in many people sorry to cool people named tucker
the cat on the right‚Äôs smile says ‚Äúdamn i finessed that human like a bitch ‚Äù keep your eye on him he may up his game and try to steal your identity or commit tax fraud i‚Äôve seen it happen before
the one sitting looks like a little mischief maker i love him
lt the one on the right looks so smug like he knew he could get you to take him home
lol i used this trick with my wife i knew if i got her in the room with one of them it was a done deal
eventually you will find out that adopting them was one of the best choices of your life enjoy the babies take care of them and give them lots of love
mike looks so smug guess who s adopted punks love it
you should be careful with kittens and collars those snap away collars designed to pop open if they get caught on something don t work as well on kittens if they get caught because they don t have the strength weight to pop it open and can strangle themselves
i bet that smug motherfucker with the collar is mike
congrats omg you must be so proud get a load of these tigers
i‚Äôm pretty sure i‚Äôve never left the humane society without another pet before
i love that so many cat people find their cat companions unintentionally years ago my mom went to an animal feed store to get rabbit food and she found our cat wednesday who was recently rescued and up for adoption we brought her home that night and she‚Äôs been my best friend ever since
god you re gullible as your wife knows congrats to everyone in your growing family
its always much better for their to be cats rather then one for mental health reasons for the cats not necessarily you
this is fantastic my husband surprised me with a cat for mother‚Äôs day and we also went to the humane society picked up our little girl piper best mother‚Äôs day ever
they re very handsome and look very cool congrats on expanding your family ‚ò∫
those two look like the perfect pair i love mike‚Äôs smile
the right cat looks like he will do your taxes from now on
those names are brilliant they look like a cheeky pair
no they are not simply awesome they are pawsome you must learn the difference quickly
they look super rad treat em good don‚Äôt use your hands to play and you‚Äôll be gtg
that smile though like s he knows you got taken but in a good way awesome
i looked up the adoption process here and i need a letter from my landlord saying i m allowed pets they also want to do a before and after adoption home inspection
how do people make major commitments like this on a whim
tifu by doing what my wife told me and going to the pet shelter
the one on the right is going to be trouble can see it in his face
i find pictures of people s pets dull as shit and always just downvote and move on in the hopes that i will not have to see as many in the future but fuck it tucker and mike are clearly cool as fuck
i love the smug smile on the cat on the right yeah that s right you adopted me mhm i m special
completely unrelated to your cats but i have that same picture hanging up in the left corner of this picture you have excellent taste in art lol
goodbye owning any type of hair ties in the house all of my ties get stolen by my cats who routinely take them to food bowl and water dish but i love them and you probably love yours regardless of how much destroying they do watch out for paper too haha good luck and hello to the kitties
if i didn t have budgies i would come and steal them two üòç
just to see what the adoption process was like that was a bait
congrats on being chosen by those cuties love how the guy on the right is smiling
is mike the one on the left with the big ‚Äúm‚Äù on his forehead
oh my goodness he‚Äôs smiling how freaking cute they look so happy to have a new home
omg is that sushi collar i think i have that for my cat
somewhat disappointed it s not tucker and dale beyond that awesome
the one on the right has a smirk on its face like sucker
they are so cute i hope you treat them well they know how to make humans happy and please if you read this remove at once the bell they are harmful to the cats imagine if someone just attach you a collar with a bell of the size of your hand and it sounds everytime you move
just to see what the adoption process was like sounds like someone just wanted some kitties and devised a plan
awww i got my cat this way years ago tucker and mike look like my cat maybe not as cute though just my opinion p
oh my the smile is so adorable no wonder you‚Äôre taking them both home
quick questions did you name them i love the names however i have to many friends named tucker and mike so i feel reluctant to name my animal that has the same name as my friends
you fool you fell victim to one of the classic blunders bald guy from princess bride
haha very nice the last time my wife went to pets mart to get sweaters for our two dogs she didn t end up getting any sweaters she brought home another dog she is no longer allowed to go to pets mart lol
i delight in knowing there s a cat called mike in the world üòÅ
the one of the right is going to be trouble what an impish grin
it really seems the one on the right is smiling that s awesome
i think the little one on the right is going to cause a lot of mischief with that cheeky smile good luck
i m a little obsessed with your cats now they are so stinking cute
cute cats no doubt about it but how on earth has this post gotten over thousand likes
awwwwh it seems like they have different personalities from the photo the kitten on the right looks like the outgoing mischievous one and the kitten on the left looks shy they‚Äôre both super cute lol
they re adorable i d have gone with tucker and dale after one of my favorite movies though
one of these cats is going to be a menace to society the other one is going to be super sweet it s not the one you think
so we could walk out with these two today lt looks at husband eagerly gt
my wife wants me to go to the car dealership to see what the purchasing process is all about maybe i‚Äôll get kittens too
"‚Äúto see what the process is like‚Äù
your wife sounds fantastic and those cats are lucky to have ya"
the one on the right looks a little smug but they re both adorable
this is why i don‚Äôt into go to petsmart anymore they always put old cats up for free adoption and at one point i was coming home with an old cat every time i went in and they a free one by the th old cat i realized i had a problem hello my name is espiritulibre and i am an old free cat holic
that one on the right looks like he‚Äôs about to do something very mischievous
anyone else think the one on the right looks smug like the face is trying to say yeah that s right you knew you were gonna take me home as soon as you saw me
look at his smile he‚Äôs like yeah ‚Äúthe adoption process‚Äù heh heh heh
i volunteered at the humane society and the adoption process was longer than day for a reason
the m on their foreheads tells me they are under the influence of babidi and will destroy humanity
awww great story but mike told me his real name is dale
show us your furniture then tell me about their awesomeness
beautiful table you got there a shame if it were to get scratched
you only have a collar on one of them so you can tell them apart dont you lol
the smile on that right kitty he knows he charmed the crap out of you and made you take him home fuck they‚Äôre so cute
oh my gawd you‚Äôre in for it now man the left one is gonna start the troubles and the right one is gonna charm you when you try to stop them adorable
that is how i ended up with two they were best friends for years both are adorable the one on the right with the little smirk tho ‚ù§Ô∏è
those ears couple of mousers there and love the smile too
i love animals and i m always happy to see them go to good homes but people should remember it s not all sunshine and rainbows animals are living things not toys they require a lot of love attention and so if you re going to take a furry friend into your family please be sure your e ready for the long term commitment
nice smile mike and you really did fall for a line üòä
take the bell off the poor guy he s a forocious tiger not a reindeer
is mike the one on the right he looks so smug congratulations on getting two brothers i always think it s a good idea to get two instead of one they re so adorable
a life without cats is possible but not worth living
hey that‚Äôs my name my wife and i got our first kitten two weeks ago weeks old congrats
look at the wee little smile of the adorable one on the right gosh this has warmed my heart
the right one looks sly af while the left looks cluelessly adorable gonna be very fun raising both of them
you both got played and made the best two decision s of your life thats how my ex got a cat and he ended up being my best friend for years congrats
ya know yesterday my husband took me to a car dealership ‚Äújust to look‚Äù he wanted to test drive some cars he was considering buying a year from now we came home with a new car yesterday may have to take him ‚Äújust to look‚Äù at the puppies at the shelter
out of curiousity did the shelter mandate these two be adopted out together they look like an inseparable pair
just to see what the adoption process was like you sir got played lol
the kitty on the right is totally smiling that‚Äôs adorable
at first i was like mike that s not a cat name then i saw the guy on the right and was like oh hey what s up mike
i assume tucker is on the left but i think the kitty on the right looks more like a tucker to me i think it s that little smirk
hey i m tucker this is meik we re gettin adopted by this hooman you want in
i m not a cat person but these cute little dudes look alright my dog would love chasing them around trying to play with them
adopting is the best we just adopted are second cat about a month ago
mike looks pleased as fuck he conned you into adopting them both
they are both cute but the one on the right just has this look about him that is toooo cute
the one on the right looks so damn smug i knew you would adopt me little bitch
yes i can t tell if that s an actual smile or a shit eating grin
my humane society called me an irresponsible pet owner and declined letting me adopt because she asked me why i was looking to adopt few months prior a homeless guy i helped with food and a drink broke into my house and robbed us took our prescription meds lots of money and more he also took my cat wanted a reward for finding him but of course we were robbed so we didnt have much wasnt enough so he never told me where he was we didnt find out it was him until he got arrested pawning out stuff under a fake name cops wouldnt even return it because we couldnt prove it was ours
whenever you re told that you ll just be looking at the humane society that s code word for i want to adopt something i m dogs deep now
oh god look at these absolute cuties welcome to the cat‚Äôs fam
i m getting a pinky and the brain vibe from these two
so awesome you got the two of them kittens love friends congrats
females are sneaky man cant believe u fell for the classic let s go see the adoption process line
awwwww so cute those two kitties are probably more grateful than you‚Äôll ever know especially if they‚Äôre snobby little snots like a lot of cats are they‚Äôre grateful but you‚Äôll never know it üòÜüòÜüòÜüòÜ
aww they are so cute congrats my so and i did this sort of went to buy cat food came home with kittens and cat food we couldn t say no they were bonded brothers and the one was a mini version of our old man cat
dogs think of their humans as family cats think of their humans as staff üòÜüòÜüòÜ
they look like the two main characters in a comedy sitcom
awwww could have been dale and tucker anyhow they re adorable congratulations
the one on the right is up to trouble congrats on your cats
i love how the right just looks like he wants to be your friend
please tell me mike is the one with the m on his forehead
humane society adoption process them you have money you yes them good you have to pay us for all our charity to this animal if you want it give us or well keep it in this cage to suffer longer you i only have but i ll give this cat a loving home them sorry but that not enough donation money for us please leave so someone with more money can look at the cat also find the rest of the money or well put this cat down when we cant sell it for full price
lol it‚Äôs so hard to adopt in the uk you have to interview prove you have adequate garden for a dog or house for a cat not complaining
oh dude has a bell on that s gonna maximize his hunting skills
haha the one on the right looks so smug too cute and congratulations
i love how the one on the right in guessing that s mike has this smirk like told ya we d get them to adopt us
classic the let‚Äôs check the ‚Äúprocess‚Äù out number rule never go looking or checking on the process for adopting anything really because you gonna end up doing it lol
wait a minute tucker so you re telling me i ll never grow into my ears
just by looking at them i feel like they have two distinct personalities left one is on catnip and right one is just chillin
mike is absolutely smirking in this photo you re mine now human
omg congratulations what i love is how distinctly different their little facial expressions are
three cheers for your wife and you they are adorable and you re about to have a lot of fun
save the skin on your hands and buy a laser light to play with them they ll love it
just to see what the adoption process was like sounds like you got got congrats on the cute fur babies though
you should have adopted an older cat as well they are the ones tgat really need adoption plus he could show the youngins the ropes
hey that s great that you adopted them but please take off that little bell it hurts their ears really badly
when you get a mushroom in mario and you go from small to big to small to big to small to big
if i saw those adorable munchkins i d also be a goner and adopt them how can anyone say no to a face that cute
mike looks like a mike that sly smile does it for some reason
yes but please don‚Äôt put bells on his collar take it off asap it‚Äôs awful for them
they look very satisfied with the situation congrats
all of our cats come from the humane society they are the best just like your two i liked expression of the one with the bell
that s how they get you amp x b oh let s just go look we don t have to get anything let s take these out of the cages and play with them we don t have to go home with them let s just look at the paperwork we don t have to sign it amp x b welcome home boys
the right one is up to some shit that grin is trouble
that is by far the sincerest look of a cat i ve ever seen
mike on the right looks like trouble expect some a m kitteh rumbling going on
those two look like a comedy duo congratulations on having been adopted by cats
you can never go in just to look you always come home with a new friend or in your case üòÄ
kitty on the right looks like it s about to say congrats bro we re gonna give you a hard time but you ll love us anyway
one looks very pleased the other looks very concerned
i think the collar is on incorrectly make sure to double check as it‚Äôs important to make sure the safety release feature will work properly such cute babies
she knew what she was doing all along my wife won‚Äôt let me go to the shelter
we stopped by while our car was getting worked on and came home with an oreo
you fell for that one hook line and sinker congrats on your new family
oh my gosh my heart is going to explode they are purr fect üíñ‚ù§Ô∏è
mike is like that chill dude who will gladly help you even if you meed nothing tucker look like that little brother who is always looking to make pranks just to laugh
mike is really happy to have been adopted he s smiling
too friggin cute love the expression of the kitten on the right i want him lol
he‚Äôs thanking you with his kitty smile in the pic good jobüëçüèª all of my pets are rescues adoptions and they‚Äôre so greatüòä
is it true cats actually hate having to wear a bell
i swear that kitten on the right is smiling no wonder you took him home
they are both so cute i love their little faces and paws
bro you definitely fucked up wait til you get home cat on the right looks smug as fuck
the cat on the right looks much pleased with his bell
beautiful choices the one on the right looks like a wise man while the other looks more rough and tumble both awesome
right cat‚Äôs breakaway collar is on incorrectly you have the slack end of it around his neck instead of the clip portion
thank you for giving these fur babies love a da home
my mom did this when i was young amp my dad told her she could get but the lady told us there was another cat that he was raised with and they couldn t be separated so we got that cat ended up being my best friend i m glad these found a home
i have a similar story my friend wanted to adopt a dog and i went with him to look i adopted one instead it‚Äôs been a year and i have no regrets
i can tell you now the one on the left is gonna be a pia i got one had the same look he ll trash the house then lay on your lap knowing there s not a damn thing you can do about it but i suppose they re worth it
for not bad for the adoption equivalent of we re just browsing lmao
when you re just browsing and then they tell you bout their for special goin on lmao congrats glad they ve found themselves home lt
the one that s standing up is gonna fuck all your shit up i can see it in his eyes
the one on the right looks very pleased with himself
you should make an instagram for them i need more of these fur babies in my life
they re already on the dining room table it s their house now
my wife convinced me to stop in at the humane society just to see what the adoption process was like amp x b haha you fell for it that s like telling your virgin girlfriend that you just want to try being naked in bed together to see what the process is like lol amp x b cute little guys are they munchkins they look like they might be
ooh they look like trouble congratulations on the new kiddos they‚Äôll bring you so much joy
tucker is skeptical but mike is happy you adopted them
they are adorable thank you for adopting from a shelter you saved lives and helped control the feral cat population
oh my goodness such cutie lil kitties thank you for rescuing them both so they could stay together furr ever lt
they are adorable and look so happy already it s easy to tell that they re lucky in being adopted into such a loving home many more years of love and memories for your new furry family üíïüíï i also love their names and mike has such a cute smile lol
is one a bell ringer and the other not or does the bell allow humans to tell which cat is in the area
i don t think i ve smiled as big as the kitty on the right over anything in my life
i see you‚Äôre from the dc area i gotta ask did you name them ask the weather guys on channel üòÄ
take the bell out please it s like torture for them when they want to be sneaky and hunt cats are not made to be noticeable
the one on the right looks hella smug like yeah i knew you loved me as soon as you saw me i m irresistible i know
hey guys look its tucker from rvb and mikey from tmnt
they re gorgeous i only adopt pets it just feels right
i did the same thing and came home with a boy i named milo congratulations brother
tucker and mike are both adorable names for a kitty give them pats for me
beautiful kitties congratulations i just stop in with supplies or toys now really want another kitty my cat agrees but the humans in the house are against the idea so i don t go any farther then the reception desk
out of curiosity what s the reasoning behing names tucker for a cat is cute mike seems too generic though
ahhhh yes the old ‚Äúwe‚Äôll just go look knowing damn well we leave with the cutest animals they have‚Äù routine it‚Äôs happened to the best of us your first time is always a fun little surprise the real shocker is when you know it‚Äôs coming next time and still fall for it üòÇ
i think you re going to have problems with the guy on the right he looks like a trouble maker enjoy your new overlords give them a scratch for me
mike is so smiley tucker has a perfect m forehead marking üòäüòª
tucker and mike broke reddit these two sweethearts look like they are from a live action animated movie
you should remove the bell from collar cats has hypersensitive hearing and bell deafens them
i got this as a notification and from the small bit of words i could see i thought it was a post about a cat husband who s cat wife convinced him to stop into the human inn why probably because the cats want scratchies either way they are adorable
is the one on the right mike he looks like a mike and he s smiling too so freaking cute
enjoy every minute you get to spend with her they grow up too fast haha ‚ò∫Ô∏è
she looks adorable congratulations for the happy floof
that is an adorable happy pup enjoy your new family member ‚ù§Ô∏è
shes so precious good thing you have the drool towel ready when my mom was a little girl they had a st bernie named bessie and everyone in the house carried a drool rag for her apparently as soon as you walked thru the door she would rest her head on your legs and well drool lol so everyone was prepared
hopefully she doesn‚Äôt get too used to sitting on laps xd

soooo cute her fur looks super soft love st bernard‚Äôs

how could he say no to those adorable little beans and that sweet innocent face what a cutie patootie just have your husband gently nuzzle the kitten for a few minutes
for peets sakes i mean just look at those little peets
that kitty has already made itself at home ‚Äî the decision had been made üòª
remind him of all the karma and points he can get by posting pictures of this cutie as it grows up
reasons to keep the cat it fozzy cat will be a great study work buddy especially if the cat is calm if it s hyper it can still work out it will remind you guys to take a brief moment to relax and play with the cat cat cuddles are some of the best cuddles if the cat has bonded with you two already it wouldn t be a very good idea to give it up it considers you guys as parents and probably would really miss you guys if you gave him up what have you got to lose a cat can be just as good as a doggo when being affectionate playful and clever in most circumstances having a fuzzy bro around keeps things lively and can brighten up your day i hope you consider keeping this kitten in your lives
keep the baby do it for the toe beans if not i ll take it
look at that precious little baby you have to keep that little kitty please
oh my god this kitoy is like a lil toasted marshmallow if you don t keep it i will eat it
cats are the easiest pets in the world to manage after week they stop waking you up early in the morning they also wait patiently for you to feed them they never beg amp x b lastly you can train cats to bake cakes and fetch beer from the fridge amp x b enjoy your kitten op
tell husband the kitten stays if he doesn t want the kitty he can leave
keep the damn kitten also rub it‚Äôs belly and feed it cream cheese
aww c mon husband look at that little floof he s adorable how about this keep the little guy for a month and then go from there
aww cute kitty and look at those toe beans keep it because it‚Äôs so fluffy and adorable
when oyur husband is asleep put the little guy next to your husbands head instant new catmaster
just tell him the following ‚Äúunless actively pregnant i will clean the cat boxes every day ‚Äù that‚Äôs our solution to the ‚Äúmore kittens‚Äù conundrum i love our animals but i will not clean up more pee
you‚Äôre keeping him he‚Äôs too cute not to end of story
i think cats do better with a companion a mother offspring group is perfect they will be better behaved and more playful than the mother alone keep both
as a nearly year old grumpy grey haired man who hates most things keep those beans they are fucking adorable now get off my lawn
you should not keep it you should give it to me reverse psychology
your fucked now guy give it up shes one shes trying to bring all of reddit against you just accept it you own cats now
do you even have a soul if you don‚Äôt keep that little fluff of fur i think not
i m pretty sure that face is enough to convince anyone
to op s husband keep this baby there i ve done my part
a real man could never say no to that cute widdle face omgxoxo eeeeee so cutes
the feetsies the pink nose how can he resist this adorableness he has to keep
convince him has he seen that adorable little fuzzynuss that should be more convincing than anyone needs
do it for the updoots also because cats are the best üíï
keep or she‚Äôll do what i did sleep on the floor with my cat crying all night the day before he was supposed to leave celebrating a year with my cat very soon he‚Äôs the best
caption to this photo should be dada just let me luv you

i am a dog person i usually have four but adopted two cats i adore them the dogs do too they are so much fun and very little work you will not regret this and listen to your woman
this guy looks very lovable hes gonna be a snuggler
orange tabby sweet and loyal almost annoying keeper
husband i will personally come to your house and poop in your hat if you do not adopt this precious child
he looks like he ll like lasagna i don t know about your husband but that should be an international plus factor
venus is quite impressive besides just being darn cute
"my two personalities coexisting
but fr very gorgeous cat"
hey boss we‚Äôve got two cat halves left over but they don‚Äôt match what do you want us to do ship it
i believe this is a chimera cat absolutely stunning
its name is venus its name is venus its name is venus
you either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain
fascinating i‚Äôve never seen such a straight line delineating an animals fur color i had shown it to my lady friend and she told me all about them you learn something new everyday
cute name for a cute boy have fun playing with lots of string
awww i read that in cartman‚Äôs chula voice and it was still adorable
the only things i misses are your taco flavored kisses taco taco burrito burrito taco taco
i had a black cat named taco real weird feelings rn
congratulations what a sweetie would love to see a picture of the nest she built you
well now you gotta give birth in that nest them‚Äôs the rules
she just can t wait to meet the new kitten that s all gotta make sure to put baby in the nest at least once to give her the satisfaction
that is so precious when the baby comes home are you going to put him her in the nest she made
when you bring the baby home you have to put it in the nest at least once
i just hope you can see your way clear to give birth in the nest she built you you don‚Äôt want to hurt her feelings
for a second i was like you ve been sitting on this photo for years doh
that s so sweet maybe she thinks she s the grandma now
what a sweet cat my pregnant kitty just flops near me asking for me to gently pet her belly i m worried because she still hasn t shown any maternal traits yet she just eats a lot and guilts me into moving her around
yo copy op why you could ve retitled it so people understood that you re not the same person when purple don t pay attention to who post things
you re going to put your baby in the nest when you get home right and give your cat reward tuna
she will forever be a good girl give her all the tuna
obviously i‚Äôm going to need details here i want a story with links and get me more pictures of spider man
thank you for this having probably the worst day i‚Äôve had in years and this brought a smile to my face much needed
cut some rocky training montage music this is inspirational
me after sitting on the toilet browsing memes for too long
he walks like the bathtub in nightmare before christmas
that made me tear up a little reminded me of the dog i nursed back to health bravo to you
that first bit of video is just me trying to get my normal dog to go to the vet
oooh a piece of candy oooh a piece of candy oooh a piece of candy
when my previous vet severed my dogs spine we had to have emergency surgery for my chihuahua troll the neurologists gave up on him walking and said he would never walk again but a kind and gentle physical therapist refused to give up üòÄ after several months of physical therapy troll now enjoys running and playing all over my house these people are angels
and the walk in the park was waiting for that and now i can t stop smiling thank you
wow these boston dynamics robots are getting out of hand
im going to hell for laughing at the beginning when they dragged the dogs feet across the ground dog looked so confused
been there done that my lab had to have bilateral tplo surgery but sadly during recovery developed some muscle wasting disorder like a fast als but before that we had the harnesses the straps the big rubber ball etc
if this was reversed it would be the worst video ever
this is an accurate representation of my friends trying to get me to go to the gym
that‚Äôs amazing was the dog injured or just very lazy
struggling with mental illnesses and my girlfriend of years decided enough was enough so right as i was getting back on proper meds and starting working again i have to deal with a relationship failure and find new living accommodations
i definitely would have become a physical therapist if i knew i could work with dogs
neat i hope the dog is mostly pain free kind of a waste otherwise
this reminds me of whenever i see videos of animals with new prosthetic limbs they initially struggle but then they get up and go unlike us humans who need considerably longer to do the same thing because we are plagued with self doubt and other personal baggage animals don‚Äôt know they are not supposed to know how to do something their resilience amazes me every time
my shepherd had a spinal stroke he was like this and after k of therapy he s walking again best k i have spent
that takes a very special person to see that through
this is truly beautiful thank you so much for posting this first video that made me tear up in a while
off topic but someone mentioned how much harder it is for humans to get use to prosthetics than for animals how the human mind interferes reminds me of an example within my family of how removing preconceptions unlocks quick healing my sweet auntie got alzheimer s and she had a fall which broke her hip she forgot she broke it forgot to fret forgot from one minute to the next and drs said they had never in their entire practices had anyone recover so quickly and perfectly from such a break
this is remarkable thank you this video was very comprehensive well done you
i went from laughing because i didn t know it was a serious situation to tearing up real fast
as a physical therapist for humans who was pre veterinary through half of undergrad this is my dream job if it paid anything
my dog crippled his back legs about months ago by rupturing a disk in his lower spine we got veterinary opinions that he would most likely not walk again and if we couldn t get him to eat or go to the bathroom on his own he would need to be put down turns out he s a miracle dog back legs are still a little stiffer and his back is humped but he can run around and jump up on the couch bed and is eating and shitting like a champ
this is the most amazing thing ever you are awesome
carefully shes a hero and first human in dog heaven
seeing him walk at the end made me feel better about laughing at the beginning carrying him like a mini gun is comical
it looks like the dog was hogtied the way it‚Äôs legs are resting
omg that doggo is sooo happy what a great job you did
how did u do it my dog has the same thing but now he s very happy
this is not helping dogs p s i have a western husky
came for the fancy transitions stayed for the health walking doggo
does anyone know what kind of dog this is looks very much like a tail less version of my mom s mystery pup
add some hans zimmer and we ve got a perfect motivational video
this just straight up is the best thing on the internet
this is awesome anyone know how long schooling wpuld take to get into this field it seems extremely rewarding
god that s got to be a rewarding job a pet physical therapist
beautiful if only more people had the same kindness
i had a lb doberman that suffered from wobblers syndrome he couldn‚Äôt walk at all for about months trying to carry him out to urinate was no easy task the vets and physical therapists at auburn university had him walking in months he had a funny gate but he was waking and as happy as ever most people have to put the dog down as they don‚Äôt have the financial resources to rehab the dog however we dug deep worked overtime cut bank on all financial excesses and paid for it all in all it cost us but was worth every penny and then some these people who work with these animals are miracle workers their dedication is second to none
yeo im fucking crying over here god bless those people man im so happy for the pup
why is there no inspirational s power ballad synched
does someone know what happened to this good boy girl
i did this with my daschhund she couldn‚Äôt use her back legs anymore because of a hernia it took us about months to get her walking again she‚Äôs been wobbly ever since but she was happy and that‚Äôs all that mattered still miss her
thanks a bunch buddy i‚Äôm at work while reading this üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠i should know better anywho that is a miracle and amazing and fabulous
i wonder how long this took cause i follow a foster pet account on instagram with a cat named mateo that is paralyzed in their hinds legs owner s been working to help them walk on their hind legs for months now but the cat still just runs across the floor dragging their legs very speedy tho like nyoom honestly i hope that the cat is able to walk again much like this pup managed to

how to walk again step rub feet on yoga mat step hump yoga ball step congratulations can walk agen
there is a special place in heaven for people like those
i need this for my dog he can walk just fine he s just lazy
props to that human being for taking all that time and utilizing so much patience to help that dog gain its life back what a good person
i wish some of my human patients got this level of care and attention
can i get some of those humping lessons as well the ones with the ball
should have just scratched him behind the ear to get them back legs moving
can t say it s as bad as full loss of leg movement but my dog suffered a fbrocartilaginous embolism a couple weeks back so she loss the use of her back left leg and a bit of the back right and we ve been doing similar exercises and physical therapy absolutely scary when the paralysis first sets in though
i had to do the same with my dog but he only lost function of his back legs and it s hard work but worth it in the end brings tears to my eyes remembering that and i m not an emotional person thanks for the post op
please rescan item please rescan item unexpected item in bagging area please rescan item
i went through this with our dachshund hydrotherapy was the best at helping their brain reconnect with her legs
this looks fairly old there is better technology and treatment for this today however it s still takes a lot of time money and effort to get a lame dog walking again regardless i hope you look at all of your options before considering putting a dog down for being lame
you‚Äôre a very special person the world would be a better place if there were more of you speaking for the dog thank you
nothing but pure respect for people who made the dog walk again
i teared up when she first walked without assistance i‚Äôll just lie here and think about this for a bit excuse me
wow that s one of the most beautiful things i ve ever seen it seems like he knew what they were doing he could probably tell his legs were being recommissioned
i hate everything most of the time but this reminds me sometimes i don‚Äôt
expensive physical therapy for a dog i wonder how many humans had to forgo such treatment because they didn t have insurance
thankyou to the person who helped this dog thankyou very very much
wow i wouldn t have thought that he gets back to almost perfectly normal after seeing this first few seconds of him hovering over the floor i wonder how hard the first few weeks have been and i salute the effort from that woman
omg how much money would it cost to rehab a dog like this if sure it is worth it to many people who love their pets but i have to guess that it would be very expensive
if the dog isn t able to walk it s all part of god s plan you shouldn t have helped it
this dog is getting better healthcare than most of us
had a seven to eight week old kitten called rocky with a walking problem as well rocky is a gray short haired persian breed with piercing yellow eyes he went sick when a virus hit him bad enough for him not to want to eat or drink anything for around a week his ears were full of mites nose was clogged shut with mucous and eyes watery but showing that rocky was still holding on to dear life we fed him water forcefully day by day soon after a course of im antibiotics and daily ear and nose cleaning he began to feel better and within three days he looked cleaner and healthier but was still difficult to feed and wouldn‚Äôt walk a week in illness he started eating small portions of cat food independently but i noticed two weeks in his illness that he had funny legs and couldn‚Äôt walk properly when he tried that‚Äôs probably because of muscle atrophy if it could affect cats that quick i kept him playing and walked him a bit ever day until he got used to moving independently although not properly within a month this story happened months ago and he‚Äôs been well since then sometimes i miss his funny walk but i‚Äôm glad he got over it all
this is one of the most wonderful things i‚Äôve ever seen i love dogs and what you did for this little baby is amazing thank you for sharing
first ever social media post to make me genuinely shed a tear beautiful to see an innately compassionate animal receive compassion
i did the same with a german shepherd who‚Äôd been hit by a car and lost his whole back end prince‚Äôs human hires me to walk him in the dog park with a sling progress was painfully slow and he moved away before prince could fully walk but he brought him to see me a few years later and with hydrotherapy he was finally able to walk pretty normally
one of my dogs a little dauchsund fell off the back of the couch and broke her back because she landed weird she was instantly paralyzed in her back legs everyone in my family was telling me i had to put her down but i didn t want to rush into it they called me a monster for prolonging her suffering it was pretty ugly amp x b i ended up taking her to the vet to discuss my options and assess the extent of the damage and even the vet was kind of sort of suggesting putting her down because it would take a ton of money and time to send the dog to a rehab facility and i was flat broke at the time i instead opted for the painkillers the vet offered tramadol and took my dog home the painkillers worked at first but she seemed like she was getting more and more lethargic on the pills and she stopped eating she was losing weight and i took her back the vet who recommended putting her on a bland diet which didn t work at all and she was dangerously skinny at this point and not drinking water or eating amp x b so the next day i was sitting there contemplating wether i should finally pull the plug on her and end the misery when i had a lightbulb go off in my head i grabbed my bong and took a huge hit of some of the best weed i had grabbed my dog by the snout and very gently puffed some of the smoke directy up her nose and into her lungs the first time i did it she just curled up and took a nap after she got done sneeze coughing what with the lethargy from the pills and all but i guess it made her thristy so she drank some water after her nap which was a small victory after a couple tries of this it actually gave her the munchies and she ate some of her food and from there i was able to slowly nurse her back to health by regularly getting my dog stoned out of her gourd and giving her the munchies eventually after a couple months of getting her stoned and trying to exercise her back legs and using one of those little doggy wheel chair things and generally just keeping her spirts up i got her back to where her back legs worked again and she was up walking around like a champ and life was great again amp x b at least for a few months then one day i come home from work and there she is at the bottom of the couch legs limp again she had fallen off the couch again and reparalyzed herself it took even longer this time but since i already was getting her stoned on the regular at this point it was easier to at least keep her weight and spirits up through the recovery process although my spirits were exceptionally low because it was winter time now and i had to carry a paralyzed dog out into the cold snow and basically just hold her until she stopped pooping eventually just like before i got her walking again and we had another good or years together amp x b shes gone now old age and pneumonia finally got her a few years ago but we had one hell of a journey together amp x b i have to note though that thc toxicity is a real thing in dogs and i do not recommend that you go out and get your dog high unless all else has failed and you are doing this a last resort to save their life and they are dying anyways my current dog is firmly not a stoner and won t even be in the room with us when we are smoking and one time i dropped a lemon cookie that was made with cannabutter and she snatched it up and spent the next hours dizzy and throwing up so its not for all dogs also do not puff directly into your dogs nose you can seriously damage their airways and lungs if you do it wrong
did anyone else play the rocky theme song in their head while watching this
damn this brought tears to my eyes bless those people üôè
i wish i could upvote this times the idea that someone would take the time to rehabilitate a single dog restores my faith in an egotistical human race that another life form is found worthy of time love and encouragement thank you for the love shown to this precious dog ‚ù§
a big thank you is not enough to whoever helped this dog
how can i find this for my dog he has a slipped disc in his neck some days he can walk better than others but he is no where near where he was a month ago
who put the tears filter over this video i can t see my phone
it makes me so happy to know there are good vetranarians and physical therapists in this world willing to help animals gain the ability to walk and run again
i m not crying you re crying fuck man strange how sometimes people make up for our horribleness
damn it now i m crying in the middle of a damn starbucks lt lt
the progression from no movement to boston dynamics to real dog was a happy journey
i‚Äôm crying this is so beautiful what‚Äôs good doggy and amazing therapist ‚ù§Ô∏è
amazing work by the therapist and the dog good job all around
what sheer determination from both amazing post why was the he not able to before injury maybe
get up no let me die there ll be treats ok i ll try
must be such a good feeling for that dog to run in grass again
fuck it you got me sentimental not that the world problem got solved but you made a dent on it thank you
saw this video posted time on the same front page i‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs fine but f k off
this is the best thing i have seen today and i have an irrational urge to hug both of you absolutely awesome
how do i give everyone involved in this all of my money
people who do things like this are the best kind of people
thank you so much for giving them a new lease and leash on life lt
thank you to all who works with animals so thay can lead a full life
for real this must require so much skill and patience
there is a rescue called heath‚Äôs haven and they do a lot with special needs dogs and shows their rehabilitation process and what not it‚Äôs amazing what they do for those animals i try to donate as often as i can
when your kid doesn t want to leave the toy section
was going yo award this but its already awarded so i will leave it as the pure awesomeness that it is
the first post that ever made me cry from happiness is someone chopping onions
damn son i wish i had super powers to heal this fella
i did this for my whippet girl a few months back the scariest time but most exciting when i saw her constant progress and finally walk and run what cant be seen in this video is the sad time when the dog is not doing therapy it got so hard for me to see my dog go through this i cried a lot but not in her presence so i wouldn‚Äôt stress her out even more i would be cheering her so she would get excited and happy and willing to try and try and try and she made it
this is at least the fifth time i‚Äôve come across this video today alone it has made me cry every time the dedication shown is so heartwarming and it paid off wholesome
cesar milan held a chihuahua over a bucket of water to help it start walking again
omg i cheered out loud when he walked by him herself omg yay
bless and thank you all who help these animals much love sent your way üíï
i m impressed they were able to figure out that it was capable of walking again
this makes me want to go into physical therapy for dogs this is incredibly rewarding
had a horrible seconds thinking this was some terrible joke and the dog wouldn‚Äôt get better
maybe she d have better balance and wicker improvement if someone hadn t cut her damn tail off that crap upsets me
i know i shouldn t but that had me in tears laughing i just imagined it could walk but blatantly refuses to now matter how hard the person tried
fuck i m done with the internet for a while to many sad and happy sad stories and i m alone
cute innocent and charming face looking fresh after taking a bath
that dog should be a professional model the photo is great too
i am the cat this path is mine you human need to stay in line am laying down to block your way yet still upon the path you stay you wanna pass i ll tell you how you need to say the password meow
that s some serious attention seeking there so cute
pet the belly and it‚Äôll scratch the shit out of you
ah the good old ritual of cat adoption op you are being adopted
that is a toll bridge the payment prefered is belly rubs
how is this aww when the fucker doesn‚Äôt even pet the cat he has no soul
the cat is just trying to collect the belly rub toll
first you must answer a riddle what is the airspeed velocity of an african sparrow no wait you got a sparrow on ya
he s so cute i d totally pick him up and throw him over the fence
what a jerk pet the cat until it doesn t want to be pet anymore
this is obviously a strategy that has seen prior success
like i m sure there s a valid reason he doesn t pet the kitty allergies or whatever but i irrationally dislike this person now
my cat does this when i m coming down the stairs better update my insurance pawlicy and if he winds up at the vet we better not experience meowpractice
i don t get it at all i ve been late to work cause i met a friendly cat his can a person just walk by this
pet the damn kitty of course it s a trap it s always a trap but it s a noble one
that s a relaxed cat it seems very friendly love me
don‚Äôt know if i should upvote because of the cat‚Äôs cuteness or downvote because of the devil human
the fact that he keeps on walking without petting it is beyond me
the cat needs scritchy scratchies from everyone who attempts to cross the bridge that is the price you must pay
is nobody gonna talk about the fact that he‚Äôs wearing like the most coveted yeezys
i should start hiking with a fish in my pocket just in case i run across an emergency like this
imagine being such a hype beast you need to hike in yeezys
come on dude pay the freaking toll it s only pets i m not asking again oh wait yes i am cat probably
cat looks like it‚Äôs legit checking those fake yeezy
i remember when my cat blocked my path and i petted the cat she was so sweet
what the hell you ve been chosen pet and adopt that cat
if i saw a cat doing this i would give it a cookie for saving me from the üêª that surely lies ahead
no you shall not cross whispering to self how the fu
i hope your boss‚Äô business continues to grow and thrive so all of you lovely humans have a stable income always thank you for saving these babies üíï side note they‚Äôre gorgeous
that kindness will not go unnoticed by the universe you have a wonderful boss
i once saved a baby bird from drowning in the carwash i worked at my boss got mad at me and told me that the raccoons will just eat it anyways i felt terrible for the poor baby and called around and got some information on what to do the bird survived luckily and i still hope it s doing well
i know that s how mama cat holds them but i can t help thinking why would you hold him like this
he really is great vet bills for kittens are expensive
pretty cute little pose with him holding his tail like that awesome to hear that they re all in comfy homes now
first time i read that as your boss arranged homes for the cat the cat‚Äôs family and some of the crew he really is a great boss
that is awesome kind of sad the momma bailed on them üòû
i had a teeny tiny pure orange tabby come crawling crying out of the woods on the job site where we were framing a giant house on a misty cool early april morn i wrapped him in a spare sweatshirt and put him in a box on the passenger floor of my truck running the heat blowing on his head then when the roach coach arrived for coffee break i grabbed a tuna fish sandwich from which i made a protein rich slurry he did lap up til his belly was round and full then he tried to clean himself but he just passed out purring the same went for lunch eating then sleeping while purring and all the way home in my lap still purring he fit in the palm of my hand as i held him under gentle warm water ridding him of dirt food and fleas and as i was drying him wrapped up in a towel his little hind leg stuck out straight up licking his leg and purring that night he curled up with me the entire time til dawn he was purring the next day on the job the one guy who said he d ask his gf if she wanted it said she didn t but i snapped back that s ok i m keeping him and when asked his name i looked over his shoulder and saw the sheet of plywood tacked to the tree spray painted with lot and said so it will be i had lot with me for over years he was the sweetest chillest cat i ever had as i ve come to know most orange tabbys to be and every night when i hit the sack he d come running jump up curl up and start purring the whole night through right up til dawn
what is the company so we can support this business
bless your boss happy cats make a happy crew and a happy crew makes a hard job easier
awww how sweet what an amazing human being gives me hope in humanity thank you for sharing
there is some serious footsie game here üíï more seriously your boss is well he s a boss üëå
your boss sounds amazing i hope hes married to someone wonderful
good to know that there are still good people in the world congrats
reading through the posts i come to the conclusion that plywood is the birthing material of choice
the real end of project contract bonus is the cats we met along the way
i was once checking some wetland permit sites next to a freeway and this little black and white kitten meowed at me from under some grass i grabbed him up and he just started purring he fit perfectly in my vest pocket i took him back to the office and he merrily strutted around meowing at everyone to pet him took him to the vet and he was a whole pound vet said he wouldn t have lasted much longer in the degree nc heat and he had injuries consistent with being thrown from a vehicle scrapes and scabs on his paws fostered him for awhile and named him nano eventually he went home to one of my husband s coworkers where last i knew he had turned into a lb monster of a cat named peety
yeah he s such an awesome dude your boss doesn t sound like a bad guy either
they re devout if they give the confirming meep meep noise

she looks like she‚Äôs being worshipped by the alpacas
this is the best writing prompt oh man the stories from this
‚Äúyou‚Äôre all probably wondering why i‚Äôve gathered you here today well that‚Äôs a good question i don‚Äôt know because i‚Äôm a cat ‚Äù
so i took a shit in a box and the humans give me a treat clean it up fill my bowl
what do we want to keep our own wool when do we want it now cat sits on it s throne enjoying the subsequent massacre it created
i know it s messed up but i could so see a hawk or something just going for the kill
how does he always avoid shearing day i need to learn to sit on posts maybe
pretty sure that cat is telling them tales from far far away
bold of you to assume that the cat doesn‚Äôt own them
why does it look like they know something we don t they are privy to some seriously interesting information armageddon a rewrite of game of thrones season
these teenage mutant ninja turtle reboots are just going to far now
i am your redeemer it is by my hand you will rise from the ashes of this world

‚Äúit was at that time that i jumped the fence never to see the dog again ‚Äù
gather round you little shits it s time to tell you a story
teefies did you ask him to say cheese because it kind of looks like he is
this is one of the purest things i‚Äôve ever seen just kids and their dog being happy
to be that young again to be able to spring up from all fours all afternoon without aching the next day this is pure joy
oh shit i remember that thing used to have one when i was younger
that a few couple means there i just save you a lot of money on marriage counselor s
this thing was great we used them as cannon during water gun fights
i love dogs man they don t care if they fully understand something or not they are such fun loving creatures and i m so happy we live in a universe where dogs and humans are companions lt
best part is the dog looking over to see if mom or dad is still watching
i wish every kid in the world could experience such joy
i dislike dogs i m a cat person but even i really enjoyed this and thought this was sweet and the dog is a great and fun companion for the children it won t turn me into a dog lover but it really means something if even i approve of this just trying to say how much i like this
oh god i unconsciously kicked in sympathy the second time it went off now i feel like i have no control over my body at all
this video is the antidote to the rest of the internet
there needs to be a subreddit for dogs mimicking humans‚Äô actions this would be on the hot page for weeks
ah what would i give to go back to being child here i am feeling sad about going to work on monday
this is what summer should be like as a kid no phones just outdoors in the sun with a sprinkler
this is lovely that is two couples a couple is two people or things
i m thinking that the dog reacted that way first then the kids played along too cute
the tail waggin shows that the dog is really into it
when i was a kid we had one of these and one of us discovered that it was ‚Äúfunny‚Äù to sit on it when it sprayed not sure why our parents never stopped us
look at that tail wag he has a good life full of loving humans
i don t have many pictures on my walls but i d kind of like this clip looping in a frame it soothes my heart
omg i remember having one of these they were super fun and i would always try to jump over it when the water went off üòÜ
did the kids start copying the dog or did the dog start copying the kids
fun fact that sprinkler uses the same firing system as old super soakers
is the dog copying the kids or are the kids copying the dog honest question
let‚Äôs be real here the dog started it and then those little hipsters cashed in on the trend
this is so sweet i‚Äôm so glad he has such kind humans
when somebody approaches you and does this same gesture there‚Äôs usually a foul smell
when i am laying sound asleep my world is quiet still the thoughts of you inside i keep forever friend i will i canno hear you say my name but feel your gentle touch it wakes me softly just the same cuz i love you so much your smiling face your human smell i ve felt it from the start i am the dog you love so well i hear you with my heart ‚ù§Ô∏è
god damn dont wake him up brutally like that poor booi
such a heartwarming video doggo smells mom cue immediate tail wagging and smiling eyes my parents dog is going deaf with age will definitely start doing this with her
is that a blue heeler cutest dog in the world that smile just melts my heart
thanks for the tip my dog is deaf and blind so i ve been struggling to find a good way to wake her without startling her i m going to give this a try
this doggo has the best family what a sweet pup so happy to be awake with her loving family üòä
he looks like a fox when his ears go down and his eyes are all wide ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
my old girl is almost completely deaf it definitely takes care not to startle her awake
i wish i was this happy and excited when i m woken up
he‚Äôs so cute that‚Äôs so amazing i‚Äôm just scared that you have to keep him on a leash as the poor pupper couldn‚Äôt do recall
can confirm that this is the best way to wake a deaf puppers who could previously hear if you touch them they startle and wake up thinking they re being attacked and kind of in a panic but their nose will awake them gently and in most cases very happy about what they re smelling when we have the need we love to wake our girl up with treats because her tail will start wagging before her eyes open
i have a deaf cat i will sometimes wake him up by stroking a finger along his head i love the sleepy chirp he gives as he wakes up followed by his happy meow when he realizes it s me
i wish reddit was just stuff like this and none of the trollling negative crap
you can just see the gentleness and love in his eyes this is honestly the cutest thing i ve ever seen
must be nice to not get attacked every time u enter the house
i do this to my puppy too they get surprised a lot when they‚Äôre deaf her sense of smell is still great though
aw what a sweet lil baby girl that tail wag when she sees it‚Äôs her hooman hits me in the feels
i wake my cat up with cheese sometimes he s not deaf but it works every time cute dog
my oldest dog is blind and at least deaf she has the soundest sleeps you could ever believe
does anyone else upvote these kind of posts before the video even starts playing
that s exactly how i wake up my deaf basset hound he had started losing his hearing last year and now is completely deaf but still has an amazing sense of smell
that‚Äôs so awesome obviously your a kind person that has a beautiful doggie üê∂
any reason why you went with letting him her smell you instead of petting him her
is it because they smell you or because they feel the warmth of their breath on your fingers
my girlfriend s dog is getting old and deaf one day we came home from a party and found the dog lying in the middle of the room not moving at all we both thought the worst petted her nothing happened after some more petting for what felt like forever she springs to life exactly like in this video never been so relieved in my life dogs are too good for this world man
i try to see how long i can be in the house before my deaf dog smells me and gets up
omg his tail the instant he realized who was waking him up you can see the joy he is feeling such beautiful boy üòçüòçüòç
anyone who‚Äôs had a senior dog has done this my girls before they passed would sleep so deep because they had lost all or some of their hearing it‚Äôs another reason using hand signals when training your dogs becomes important it‚Äôs such a cute moment the recognition of your smell
okay i legit cried i miss my puppy so much right now üò≠
i read the title and for a moment there thought the owner was about to blast an air horn in its ears or something like it went to bed a hearing php found itself waking up a dead pup
i have deaf cats waking them up is my favorite thing in the world
i think this would be a great way to awaken hearing dogs too smells mean more to a dog than anything
i would yelling be from across the room asking him to wake up but then realize i‚Äôm stupid and proceed to give him pet pats
i must know the breed this looks exactly like my dog who is a mutt that i haven‚Äôt dared guess the breed of no info on the parents at all
our german shepherd lost her hearing at about i would forget all the time and she would be sleeping on the couch and i would want to snuggle her i would push on the couch cushion next to her i wish i would‚Äôve thought to do this poor girl would just get startled all the time
my doggy has recently become completely deaf sometimes she jumps awake when we walk into the room slide out a chair i‚Äôll have to try this
i read waking up a dead pup prepared myself to see the dog jesus
he looks glad somebody so loving is there for him to treat him right
my dog has gone deaf as he got old so i woke him up by putting my face right next to his face and apparently i startled him because he punched me in the eye
i read this as waking up a dead pup i m both glad and disappointed at this mistake
after my kitty puff went deaf at i taught her signs for food come here and no she was smart and learned quickly also she was an indoor cat she lived for years after that
that s an extremely good doggo i m glad he s got so much love
waking up a deaf pup just anyone would any other pup
my dog also became deaf because of age and i was always unsure on how to wake her up i think im gonna try this
is that a blue heeler i had a dead bh growing up too she was great with hand commands so cute
awe just the scent of his mommy makes him happyüòÑwhat an awesome post
i actually really appreciate this video besides being adorable it shows how i can properly wake up my dog who is going deaf from age i‚Äôve always ended up startling him on accident but this will help thank you
did u just fart on ur hands and then make him smell it
we have a deaf st bernard waking her up is one of my favorite joys in life her pure excitement every time is heartwarming
that‚Äôs the cutest fucking thing i‚Äôve ever seen in my life
‚Äùsmell my fingers ‚Äù ‚Äùoh you finally did it good master ‚Äù
this makes me wonder probably so if a dog s remaining senses become more effective when one of its other senses has been removed like it does with humans
"i totally get this
our boy used to be able to hear my car coming when i would get home from work and be ready for me now i need to go to his crate and flail my arms so he can see i‚Äôm home üòå"
this is how my year old chihuahua is has no idea your next to her until you pet her and the little tail starts going
that pup s tail has gotta be a flamethrower cause it s melting my heart with the way it gets going
seeing him act like nothing is different is just great hope life goes great with him
odd question but does a deaf dog make an odd sounding bark
i know they love you so much and its funny when you touch there back they jump and look around and then wag my applehead is deaf
how can dogs wake up with vigor instantly and how can i learn this power
tried that with my dog but she also kinda blind and thought i was the cat so she snapped at me so we just leave her be for the most part
that one will never be able to listen to who s a good boy
how can dogs wake up and be immediately ready to go whereas when i wake up it takes me ages to even be able to keep my eyes open and i feel miserable for the next hours
this is perfect it makes me feel good to know that somewhere out there things are just wholesome
my dog is also deaf and he does this when i wake him up it s beautiful
i love seeing those little licks my dog does them when hes super comfy
thank you for posting this your pho‚Äôs love for you and your kindness really melted my heart
when i was my dad forced me to abandon a deaf pup in the woods never forgave him for it
this takes me back to my deaf pup who passed a couple years ago so sweet ‚ù§Ô∏è
i love dogs so much sndihejsishshehwjwhisfj so cuteeee
i am glad that they are not the people who try to kill dogs that are trying to survive
she is the sweetest the way she reacts melts my heart
what a sweetheart looks a whole lot like our cattle dog x kelpie called tasha she was the best girl ever and lived happily to yrs old it‚Äôs a pleasure to remember her again today thank you kindly for sharing your special friend xx
i love this i m a deaf guy so it warms me up pretty good when i see things like this tips for communication stomp your feet to get their attention i m not talking about knee breaking stomps just a little stomp stomp it alerts them of your presence if you re a bit of a distance away flicking light switches on off you can train them to understand that it is you switching lights on and off by showing them the mechanism tap on their shoulder to get their attention or rub em like the op did perfectly done give them real basic gestures like eat drink poop pee drive etc you name it it can be done all you have to do is associate the act with the gesture i am just trying to give tips for people who may get a deaf dog lt
my heart can t take much more of this cuteness it s going to melt
i also have a deaf dog we wake her the same way i love how excited she is when she wakes up
oh my goodness these comments are making me cry one thing i know for sure is animals teach us human kindness they teach us to love and they never judge gonna be sure i spend some extra quality time with my fur baby ‚ù§Ô∏è
my deaf dog used to have a habit of sitting in corners i think it was because no one can sneak up behind you from a corner
s he wakes up quicker than my laptop from seep mode
dear lord those ears and tail scream a lovely relationship so gorgeous
yep mine are now one blind and one deaf hand signals and scent are your best friend
all deaf dogs are the most important to have anything you can do to make an impact on that little dogs heart i‚Äôm glad you have one because that is what that dog needs thank you
we do not deserve dogs but thank god they don t know that
i thought he was going to scream in its face then wake it up
going against the grain here but i‚Äôll purposely surprise my deaf dog when he‚Äôs sleeping or unaware i‚Äôm around one toddler and one crawler in the house so i don‚Äôt want his first reaction to surprise to be bad so i‚Äôll often surprise him and then praise him or give a treat now when a rugrat grabs his tail with him unaware he thinks something good is happening he‚Äôs been deaf since birth
i started teaching our golden hand signals a couple years ago because our other golden went deaf
do you think the sniffer is exceptionally good since the good boy doesnt have hearing
op scratched their butt right before hitting record
after reading so many of the comments here i just started crying uncontrollably i currently have an almost year old golden retriever and getting him is the best thing that has ever happened to me as goldens usually don t get to the age he s at i can call myself a very lucky owner however i know the sweet guy isn t going to live very long anymore and it s been bothering me very much for a while now to the extent that i dream about him about to be out down every single week and me also uncontrollably crying in the dreams same dream every week he s had a good life and the whole family has always been caring for him deeply he s been on a lot of very fun trips with us lately he s been having some physical and mental issues he can t sleep on his own anymore if he does he will mindlessly walk around the room all night therefore i sleep next to him at night and this feels comfortable for him also hips aren t great anymore and very often when i go for a walk he will just randomly trip and fall on the ground and i usually have to help him get up it truly breaks my heart yet he doesn t seem to bother very much and continues sniffing the world he s been with me for more than half of my life and i m extremely grateful this video and all the comments just reminds me again i will have to say my final goodbye to him soon
i do the same thing with my deaf cat as soon as he smells me walking up to him he opens his eyes and starts purring
the last year of my freddy‚Äôs life he had gone completely deaf i would come home every day to find him curled up on my bed waiting for me like this thank you for sharing brought back warm memories of my best friend
i used to pet sit for a deaf dog and i would wake him up the same way he was a sweetie
i just love the fact that joy and excitement have universal tells for dogs like we all can register instantly when any dog is like hey that s my human that i love at a glance lt
this was a super great gif and then i put the sound on and heard the thump thump thump and i died congrats i m dead now i hope you re happy i sure am
i have a blue heeler that was born deaf as well when we wake her up she runs straight for the door though
when we become deaf or blind or something similar our other senses are hightened to compensate for the loss dogs already have such powerful sense of smell to begin with imagine how even more sensitive that has become and for the sole purpose of remembering the smell of their hoomans
tail wagging ears back tongue out stretch engaged this is the dog equivalent of waking up to felatio
i wish i knew to do that before i accidentally scared my old deaf wiener dog before he passed
is this good boy a full heeler i used to have a red mixed one with a puffy tail like that i never knew if it was a trait of their breed or something else it was a very silly foxlike tail give your guy an ear scratch for me i miss mine every day
we don t deserve these wonderful animals in our lives but i m so thankful we have them
i adopted a deaf dog two years ago and he is the best i m so happy i found him
i love how immediately his ears go back and he realizes hey i can let my guard down i love you
that s the cutest fucking thing i ve seen in my entire fucking life
know how you want to up a deaf pup you don t you let it sleep you d be pissed if the dog did you that way for karma
i did that once with a deaf dalmatian i had she was happy to see me unfortunately i had literally scared the piss out of her
thank you hadn t thought of that felt bad when i was scaring her when waking her
my dog is deaf and i tickle the bottom of his feet to wake him up
when i wake up my deaf dog he acts like he was just hit by lightning
well i completely fell in love with him in the first three seconds heart melted
probably the most beautiful video i ve seen on reddit this week
humans dont deserve dogs lokk at that tail waggin ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
i had a deaf dalmatian i would stomp on the floor when i came in the house so she would know i was home i had hand signals walk i love you i miss her
so cute sorry for messing up the comment count that was on the perfect
as someone who has an older puppy yrs who is losing vision and lost her hearing this made a light bulb go on about how to wake her up i always pet her but it always scared her
this video makes my heart happier every time i scroll past it thank you op üíó
this is how i wake up my dead girl too üòÖ yours is adorable
i have such a soft spot for older dogs and people they give so much during their lives and i ve seen far too many get treated with less respect than they deserve in their old age both dogs and humans if there s ever a time someone and yes i refer to dogs as people needs compassion and help it s in their golden years this video demonstrates that perfectly i lost my year old shih tzu gizmo on january this year and he too was deaf and also blind that little guy taught me more about love empathy and loyalty during our years together than i ever would ve learned without him i will be forever grateful to him for making me a better more caring person people say they wish dogs could live longer and part of me does too but honestly the pain we feel when we do lose them is so bad can you imagine saying goodbye to them after or years my heart will forever hurt for the loss of every dog i ve had to say goodbye to but the wonderful memories they give me are priceless so i continue to not replace them but rather to replace the loss i feel by getting another one to love i agree with all of the other posters saying we don t deserve dogs because they re too good for us but i sure am glad that i have them in my life because they are absolutely one of the best things about my life
that‚Äôs how i woke up my old man too he wasn‚Äôt deaf just old and was a heavy sleeper and the reaction was the same xd
its cool that when you turn on the sound you can hear what the dog hears
i am sure someone else has said this but i really appreciate that you are so kind to your baby i can see that you are careful to wake him up without scaring him because he can t hear you coming give him a cuddle for me awww
thank you for being so gentle with your sweet baby god bless
i love how dogs can go so quickly from dead asleep to tail thumping love it s like who dares to disturb my slum omg hi mom i love you
"plot twist the dog woke up cuz she‚Äôs got
butt fingers"
read this as waking up a dead pup and was confused for a moment as to why this was on this subreddit
so you know when people say i literally just watched this times but didn t actually watch it times well i can genuinely say that i watched it times because that dog is so cute and looks so gentle and sweet i just want to hug the pup and give it all the love it could ever desire
what did he smell on those fingers to wake him up so quick
i love how when she sees you her tails instantly wags
human here sniff my finger dog smells like fish you had a play this morning mom human gotcha you deaf prick
who‚Äôs a good celebrity who hasn‚Äôt yet fallen to the trappings of hollywood limelight they‚Äôre so cute and they grow up so fast
i m not dog sign language expert but i think the tail wagging means he is happy
me looks away for seconds my family steals all the food i kept in the fridge me desperately figuring out which of those fuckers took my shit
aw yes my cat does this too only she s not blind just stupid but i love her all the same
its reaction was so much better than i could have imagined
he what what yahoo i m outta here wait where s the hole
it looks like the one that went into the hole was figuring out which way to dig to jail break to the other side of the glass
he thinks the sound of the other fox is prey under ground you can see arctic foxes do this through snow but he s possibly not the brightest spark
you just that fox was thinking oh man what the heck happened to steve or whatever the other foxes name was
will be even more of a beauty when full grown hint hint
so pretty i could never foster or i d end up with eleventy billion cats and dogs and rabbits and ferrets and horses and elephants
aww she looks like a snowshoe they‚Äôre great kitties
omg do you have any cats already i think one more has just adopted you
very cute out of curiosity have you had a vet check her out it‚Äôd be wrong to diagnose anything from a photo but i‚Äôm trying to figure out what that little spot hole is at the base of her ear
great yeah that‚Äôs a perfect example of why looking at a picture is never enough
she is a cutie and will grow up to be gorgeous the white paws kill me so adorable
that has to be one of the prettiest cats i have ever seen üíóüêæ
i get so pissed at seeing all the cats who wander into peoples lives when is my chance
anyone else notice her ear is that a sore also is she patchy on her head or just the angle
if this is a wild turtle you‚Äôve killed him he won‚Äôt be strong enough to survive
me trying to find the neck hole on my tee but accidentally putting my head through the sleeve hole instead
this reminds me of something i just can t put my finger on it
it‚Äôs turtle season i‚Äôve rescued quite a few in the last month from getting ran over most recent one being today they are pretty suicidal
when you try to show off ya meat but its cold outside
sea turtles literally gain their strength by traveling from their nest where they hatch to the ocean that‚Äôs why interfering with turtle eggs in the wild is a no no
aw poor baby kudos for taking care of him hoping he recovers well
keep it up sin we all believe in you what a cute little fighter well done for being such a brilliant owner x
what a cutie baby oh my goodness i need him in my life
thanks to math i read this as sine damn you sohcahtoa
i‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs doing better can someone explain to me the science reasoning behind why cbd would help him
give him a scratch behind his ears for me thank you for being good to him
what was your cat s original diagnosis i m happy to hear he s alive but i really have to place doubts on the integrity of cbd oil doing anything for cats so many owners using anecdotes for different things it s just becoming another coconut oil apple cider vinegar craze at my clinic
i had a black cat i named sinn he lived years i had to put him to sleep in do to blader cancer good luck with the treatment i take cbd oil everyday and rub it on the outside also
cats seriously have lives my sisters stoped eating when she introduced dogs and new cats to the family cat was skin and bones when my mother took it in and fed it with a syringe of wet cat food twice daily for months eventually she ended up eating on its own and lived another years i believe she was when she passed i have no doubt sin will fully recover best wishes
i think your cat may be broken have you tried turning it off and back on again
she y all sure he s not an overly neutered male most orange tabbies are male
bottoms up kitty congrats on your forever home and your understanding family let the crazy times roll
i love it i have a girl kitty chloe who does that so cute
while i m teary eyed watching this i m somewhat disappointed as a year old he didn t flip the bird the second he figured out he could move the fingers
if i was a year old go just got a bionic right arm i know why i would be smiling
not a true year old boy was expecting a middle finger immediately from him
this right here this is why i love science those moments where you just go holy this is a real thing now
gt don t let it flop repeated the developer over and over under his breath
really wish i could get something like this but it s much too far outside my budget
hey way to go science bet even god was like damn good shit humans
i can‚Äôt believe we as a species made something like this unbelievable how amazing humans are look how happy he is warms my heart
are we almost close enough to have bionic arms from apple or samsung have phones built in projectors maybe
this blows my mind we re literally living in the future i cant wait for another years when shit gets even more nuts
now smash if i had one of those i would honestly be just smashing everything like the hulk
that s ok make sure to check your shoes tomorrow morning
i was amazed when my bet showed me dogs don‚Äôt have a gag reflex or some crap the vet shoved a pill halfway into the dog‚Äôs mouth and let biology do the rest i‚Äôve found giving my dog medicine in pill form very easy ever since
my dog would have ran for her life once she saw that second hand move towards her mouth and then she‚Äôd be mad at me for hours for simply caring about her health
the scarf translates to pees and poops a lot i am not making a joke that is what it says
i m not doing this because you commanded me to i m doing it because i feel sorry for you
we had to give my dog a few pills a day after she had surgeries to save her leg and thank goodness for pill pockets they made it so much easier to give to her because she thought they were just treats
where‚Äôs his treat you can‚Äôt trick the good boy like that and not give him a reward
giving dogs medicine is always an exercise in deception üòÅ
my dog doesnt give a shit about pills i wrap it in a piece of lunch meat with him watching and he takes it so easy he even whines when its pill time to remind us because he loves it so much
cat proceeds to wander aimlessly for an hour before falling asleep under some bushes
following a cat with a sign on it is absolutely how i‚Äôll get kidnapped and murdered i‚Äôm not even mad
automatically misread this garbage sale been watching too much office
lead on kitty i will follow you anywhere actually kitty has rbf so might not be inclined to lead anyone anywhere except to their doom
the beautiful blonde fur and blue eyes invite a stronge ancient norse deity name like odin thor heimdall baldr tyr take your pick
and wendy has stormy eyes that flash at the sound of lies and wendy has wings to fly above the clouds above the clouds
who in their right mind would dump this gorgeous little creature
aw that wee little doggie is about as big as her lunch my heart
how can people be so cruel to dump such a sweet baby karma‚Äôs a bitch you get what you put out
he‚Äôs adorable but why would you put a dog on a restaurant table
this is where cgi gets scary cause i was thinking that he wasn t real at first
scooby has been reincarnated into our world what mysteries will he solve what villains will he stop find out on the next episode of scooby doo
original poster of this was u laliza she has tons more cute photos of this little dude
oh wow that legit looks like scoop grow your and a goatee then get a green shirt and you re ready for comic con
what breed looks similar to my dog and i ve been trying to figure out what she is
omg i nearly burst into tears seeing this pic this sweet pup is the spitting image of my beloved whiskey who i had to goodbye to a year ago i hope you get to enjoy many good years with this very good boy
that pup actually looks like scrappy and i want to punch it
awh what breed is this beautiful boy scrappy doooooooooooo x
scooby is a great dane this does not look like a great dane lol
i feel like it looks a lil more like scrappy but before he turned out to be a lil evil snot he was cute once haha
that dog looks more animated than the one from the movie
all i had to do to get my first gold is to repost a picture that was reposted times time to get my greasy fingers on this post
at this stage in his life he s more of a scrappy doo
when i was little i had dreams where scooby doo was my dog and i thought they were real i asked my mom if i had scooby as my dog and she said ‚Äúyeah of course ‚Äù then i had the dream where scooby doo ran away and i couldn‚Äôt find him i cried for so long in the dream and real life
not bad for a screengrab but i‚Äôll be really impressed when i see some gameplay
soo cute my husband taught our year old to say ‚Äúruh rob‚Äù when he trips knocks something over or has general scooby doo esque accidents and it‚Äôs very fun
felt cute might solve a murder mystery later i dunno
my year old non verbal apraxia but crazy bright son has had a invisible dog for more than a month we read this forum at every bedtime and love every animal posted but tonight was exciting because he got to show me what his puppy finally looks like this is little fella finally fit the non verbal bill and he was so excited glad to finally see what he sees
i m angered by how much this actually looks similar to that bs movie
how many times will i get to see this scrappy doo how many times will this repost get upvotes this is just exhausting
so the key to free karma is to buy a pet that looks similar to well known popular pets from movies and shows mhmm
if the butterfly turned to fur i wouldn t be able to tell
itt nobody questioning why the butterfly is faceplanted on the dog s snout ‚Äã it s dead and planted and given a misleading title
could you imagine flying doggos best buds ever crispr get on it
nice you got the legendary headgear for the boxer class
totally had to go listen to the song when i saw this
that butterfly makes a good brow for the dog seems cute
oh my heart ‚ù§Ô∏è those chubby little hands and total attention on grandmom beautiful baby
no no do go on just what did francine have to say to that little white
i don t want any more kids but damn if that didn t make my ovaries burst
take your glasses off so he she can read into your soul
he s like i don t know what she is saying but damn she is cute
that baby is so so cute it reminds me of my granddaughter when i took care of her tears in my eyes lovely
i see stuff like this and it makes me understand my mom a little better i never had kids and i can t imagine how wonderful it must be to have a little person i created looking at me like that and then that baby grows up and changes and you don t always get along so when i see babies and their moms i think i should always be nice to mine lol
mine never looks at me like that what a sweet little video
everytime i see this i think the baby is wearing one of those french baguette man hats
soaking up everything she‚Äôs doing wish they would always be like that beautiful babe
you can t fool me i know a killer rabbit when i see it
instead lets judge off a couple seconds of a gif instead
i think you need to look up the definition of a few
mote mutilated animal pictures please quit posting animal cruelty
there are actual reasons why certain breeds are much more likely to attack and should be avoided past it looks tough so shitty owners buy them and mistreat them
it s a breed that was considered a protector of children a century ago
i did not expect him to bite at the second mark glad he didn‚Äôt kill it
pitt bulls are totally bomb some of the cutest and sweetest dogs i ve seen are pitts
pitties are among the gentlest and smartest dogs i ve met they ve been used for fighting because they can clamp down with bone breaking pressure however humans can and frequently do lie cheat steal kill in a million brutal ways torture rape the world they re living in and commit genocide to a degree unequaled before or since our arrival on this earth but some of you want to label a dog vicious because it has strong jaws riiiight
i still draw the line at the akita i was attacked by an akita for no reason my girlfriend volunteered to walk and feed this guy s dog that meant that i had to do it first day was fine second day the dog bit my arm and chest and shredded my pants leg while biting my shins i beat the dog with a large potted plant to get him away from me it was the only thing within reach i called the owner and told him that his dog will be hungry when he gets home in days i had to go to the doctor out of pocket expenses after insurance dog was quarantined for days by animal control and then turned over to the owner the owner was poor and said there was no way he could pay for the medical bill i have scars on my side from the teeth some time later the dog attacked his owner and was put down so my new rules are no akitas my tenants in my rentals are not allowed to have them either per my lease terms no volunteering me to do anything for anyone don t make friends with random poor people on the train
my wife and i do rescue dog transport when a rescued dog needs to get to an appropriate facility or to a new owner a dog can be driven across the country by several people handing off the dog at no cost to the receiving party kinda like a pony express for dogs for several months we were transporting rescued pitties that were from a fighting ring we transported so many that were missing ears and had scars all over their faces or females that were overbred no not every dog from that ring was saved many couldn‚Äôt be though to have a dog that has clearly been through hell turn out to be a sweetheart was truly amazing to see
you should repost this every week to reach a wider audience haha i read elsewhere that pitbulls were originally bred to protect small children as they were recognized as gentle and protective breed especially with children ‚ô°
gifs that end too soon he was just about to swallow it whole
my former best friend had a pitbull he got it as a puppy and his methods of training the dog included yelling and screaming at it or beating the dog sometimes whipping it with a belt my ex friend couldn t figure out why the dog was acting aggressive and always on alert he nipped at strangers that would come to the house my ex friend asked me to dog sit the pit bull for a week and when i got him to my home i found him to be one of the sweetest dogs ever he would walk right up to you and plop his big head on your lap for pets if you happened to be sitting he played with my other dogs and got along well with them that was when i learned a dogs temperament may be a little genetic but i firmly believe that how you train raise a dog definitely impacts their temperament and behavior
my husband used to have one and he used to get random stranger haters that would tell him how irresponsible he is for owning one he was a sweet sweet boy
this is so cute i recently got a dwarf bunny and my pitbull is terrified of him each time i let the bunny out my dog hides in the bathroom
i am the cat this how i lie to watch the birbs up in the sky when upside down my head can see them birb brains flying over me on back of couch i lay inside my legs spread eagle open w i d e then out the window dreaming i just like a birb wish i could fly
this is the best thing i‚Äôve seen all day stan you spread those legs man
he doesn‚Äôt have the balls to switch to another position
i totally read that as satan and was admiring your imagination and naming creativity since the thumbnail looks a bit like a goat s head
i thought it said this is satan and the cat was doing horns
i first read ‚Äústan‚Äù as ‚Äúsatan‚Äù because the legs looks like horns to a silhouette of a goat or some shit
looks like a lot of women like to bird watch as well
the morning rain clouds at my window and i can t see at all üéµüéµ
can‚Äôt stop watching the bun on the second stair from the bottom third bunny from the right he can‚Äôt seem to keep his paws underneath him they just keep sliding apart
my anaconda don t want none unless you got buns hun
how could you skip bunnies i would have gone through each row one by one like a graduation ceremony
noone mom i want two bunnies for my birthday two months later
i m impressed that you got them to stay in one spot like that the buns i ve had only sat still when eating pottying and sleeping
someone have a good time if it s just for a little while
clearly he was a ghost did you see how he just disappeared at the end
a great secret to having a happy life is to just act like a kid sometimes
i m very upset that he didn t do it on the way back
op did you send this to his company great feedback is always needed too
that guy is probably the happiest drunk man you ll ever meet
hey yknow what poor guy s probably a great postman who just enjoys his job and wants to have fun good for him most people aren t anymore
i was disappointed he didn t hopscotch on the way back to his truck
he s got a little swagger too he seems like a fun person
my gf does that at the young age of it makes both of us feel like teenagers again she is happy and i m embarrassed
i love that split second where he sees and makes up his mind to go for it fuck yeah buddy you hop that scotch
i ask myself sometimes why adults don t still play hopscotch elastic skip rope and pear ball like honestly it s pure fun while you re talking good exercise too i miss it
dang boogie yt hit you that hard now you gotta deliver boxes well where i live it s good pay so good luck francis
i love people like this makes me feel genuinely happy
i don t think i ve ever noticed an arm cuff like this in any similar photographs do you know where this was taken so beautiful
i feel like the cat is dead stuffed they used to do it with people but something about that cat looks off
looks like that cat rolled up its sleeves for the occasion or it‚Äôs stuffed i can go either way
she s so pretty the girl in the dress is okay too i guess
from her expression she looks like she may be in mourning i also vote dead cat
i wonder if we would still have to dress something like that if ww hadn t turned the world on its head i m thinking social change would have been so much slower
interesting arm band bracelet she‚Äôs wearing i can‚Äôt say i remember seeing anyone wearing something like that where she is wearing it in her arm before
my great grandpa did something like this once but except it was on a plantation
that is a beautiful picture the composition and everything in it
she looks like esme from peaky blinders jon s gipsy wife
my favorite period for women s fashion was from to about it doesn t look very comfortable but it was so feminine and lovely
the cat didn t smile either guess it runs in their family
no way a cat stays still long enough for old timey photography mr whiskers is compliments of the local taxidermist
that cat has seen some shit dysentery covered wagons the works
that cat has been licking some original formula coca cola
cat definitely not dead was hard to get much expression from eyes in c s stuffed animals
the kitty looks dead stuffed but the young lady looks lovely beautiful unusually clear photo the smile on the young woman is especially rare but kitty creeps me they had this weird habit of taking photos of dead relatives but this picture was taken much later kitty just looks weird and she is holding it in a tense grip which may mean cat is alive or it just freaks her her other hand looks tense as well never seen this style of hair either not on a grown woman where was this taken spent too much time on this pic
my brain automatically made me think that the cats name was sir winkles
don‚Äôt want to alarm you lady but i think your cat is stuffed
i keep forgetting people back then had cats üòÇüòÇ i wonder if they had their own form of cat memes or something
her and her family probably planned this picture for weeks
that cat is super dead right now sorry for the depressing comment but that‚Äôs the first thing that came to mind
that cat is most definitely stuffed old time photos like these required the subject to be completely motionless for several seconds
i was under the impression exposure time was rather long back then if i am right how did the cat manage to stay still if i am wrong it won t be the first time
last time i checked in photographs weren t in sepia tone then again i could be wrong if i am feel free to correct me
isn‚Äôt funny how even cats back then look kind of ‚Äúdifferent ‚Äúlike people
her cat has a wild look in the eyes and body language too much flash she looks calm
‚Äúi‚Äôm really getting sick of your s‚Äî mildred ‚Äù ‚Äî mittens
i wonder if the very fact that she has the leisure and the money for a photo and a pet cat for that matter means this is a fairly wealthy person i bet so years ago people tended to not have much free time at all working class worked many more hours than modern people and even middle class had to spend a lot of time in household chores laundry took and amazing amount of time before the advent of fully automatic washers and i think dryers came after that because even years ago i remember people putting clothing on clotheslines this actually was a great way to dry stuff as i recall since the clothes really smelled fresh without chemicals but of course it took a long time
she is absolutely drop dead gorgeous well she was then anyway now probably not so much
considering what a photographer had to do back then for a good photo give that guy some respect for pulling this photo off
i m surprised she got her cat to sit still for a picture i can t even get mine to look at me half the time
i wonder what she fed the cat back then to be so fat
she s so adorable her face looks so elegant and fluffy i wanna cuddle her so bad now üò≠
i think the cat chose you sorry to inform your fianc√© sister of the news
it would be great if this cat‚Äôs name was hercule purr ot
she looks so similar to my cat i miss my cat üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
my cat is named olive she s a darker shade of black
she‚Äôs so cute and i have a cat named olive who is also afraid of everything and everyone üòÜ
i haven t seen this posted so i m going for it i mustache you a question olive
i have the short haired boy version of olive grey and white with a white mustache and all i ll have to get around to posting him
she looks very comfortable around you so i would not be surprised if you and olive met again or maybe she just likes having her picture taken
cats choose people my wife brought our cat home and hates her and attacks her all the time but loves me and i was never a cat person
looks like she s about to deliver a speech on the house floor in support of the mckinley tariff
you shall bring me food and i will tolerate you we will call this a probationary period sir
her body language looks pretty relaxed you seem to have earned her approval
she is beauty probably afraid someone will steal her
where have i seen this picture or cat before she looks so familiar
that mustache is fucking stupendous what a sight to behold
haha my cousin s cat is the same after days of me trying to feed him and him running away i finally managed to get him to eat from my hand but of course in the end he smacked my hand and ran away
she looks like she‚Äôs probably the greatest detective in the world
my uncle has a cat who s a civil war survivor he s also scared of everything and also looks majestic
that scared the shit out if me i thought she was smiling
she s a beautiful young lady my boys üêª and i send her all the hugs kisses and cuddles ü§ó
this cat is prettier than most people i know the floofstache oh my heart
olive is a cute name but i would have felt compelled to call her stache or stash for easier pronunciation very lovely girl glad she came out and said hi
get some bonito flakes for her and she ll love you like crazy
my cat is also very shy and scared of everything i m glad i ve got a video of her at six weeks before i even adopted her showing that she was just as shy back then even playing with her own littermates so at least i know i didn t break her p
has your sister ever tried a feliway diffuser i swear by them for helping cats relax you can get them on amazon they plug into the wall and last quite a while and olive is adorable and quite photogenic
i‚Äôve seen this image many a time over the years of the internet
my daughter in law rescued two wee kitties about years ago i have never seen either of them but she and my son insist they exist
looks cute but seems really unsafe if a glass falls over you get a bad mix of shards a kitty
went flat all the suds died out in that one give it back to the waiter
if one of those tipped over it would be awful not really aww
the stages of cats when born they are solid in their big kitten stage they turn liquid and stay like it
excellent nose on all three two are full bodied but one of them is a little flat
who are these people putting kittens in glass wine glasses for likes on reddit like what happened to people like you as a child to make you need to do this for attention
that s what happens when you dont set your kittens right
you‚Äôre going to name them after types of vino right pinot chardonnay grigio
they are so cute lt especially the one who s in the middle
this is terribly dangerous if one falls over the glass shatters then likely they all do and you‚Äôve cut and harmed three kittens gross thoughtless assholes
as cute as this is it s a good way to potentially severely injure your kittens if one of those glasses breaks
can we just ‚Äúpaws‚Äù and admire the sick chair in the background
the middle was one like ‚Äúdamnit susan get me out of this cup i‚Äôm tired‚Äù
really uncool to take a chance on injuring the kitties considering these are tall and brittle glasses
those look like riedel black tie sommelier grand cru burgundy glasses only per stem this person has indispensable income as well as indispensable kittens apparently
what is this and what does it mean or signify yikes oh now i know what yikes means dang
jim what are you doing i¬¥ve given up on life steve you should too it¬¥s surprisingly comfortable you¬¥ve been giving up on life for the last week please stop you¬¥re making mark depressed
you re not scare that they might break and get glass in the poor kitten take them out of the wine glasses now please
i can‚Äôt cope with the way the stems and bases or whatever it‚Äôs called of the glasses are not the same
i wonder if my humans ever coming home again am not sure if she knows routine this babysitting fren does she know that i kinda like to sleep next to my ball n if i m not tucked in just right i canno sleep at all ok am on my bed now n am ready for the tuck allright so far so good my fren i think i am in luck ah yes my ball i like it right next to my head thanks my fren when mom gets home can i sleep on her bed
reminds me somewhat of my dog he wont start eating until he has been given permission he just stands there staring at the bowl
please tell me that is a hamster ball that he is cuddling i need to believe that this adorable guy has his own pet
my pup is the same way she picks out a toy from her box before bed brings it upstairs and has me tuck her in with it one of my favorite parts of my day with her
my pitbull was the same except she had to be tucked into my bed with her head on the pillow between my husband and i it was a bad habit that was totally our fault
i use to tuck my boxers mia and isa in when it was cold as they slept in my garage isa got up too much and our garage had a doggy door so she d let herself out during thunderstorms i d go down to check up on isa as she got scared i d wrap her up and hold her to clam down mia just slept thru everything
very dangerous animal right there never to be trusted around small children s
my staffy throws a fit and wont stop barking at us until one of us tucks him in
this is my dog but he has to get up several times a night for water and to cook off and need to be re tucked he also likes to sleep in bed under the covers so he nudged you when he is ready to be let back under
he looks so ashamed for having to be tucked in ‚Äúi‚Äôm a big boy but it‚Äôs so nice‚Äù absolutely adorable
my dog has the same orange kong football with the ball inside
when i first looked at the picture i thought why is he sleeping w a bowling ball and why wasn t that the focus of the title instead of the tucking in part
like ever i mean once or twice it s cute but after a while it d just be really needy and annoying to me and the poor dog would be super tired because it d only sleep when i was home and had the wherewithal then again i have a cat that demands pillow forts for her day naps and she just trained my more reliable partner to do it instead
he does look worried that his family has abandoned him such a sweet boi
my old man dog growls at me until i put him on the bed then proceeds to get under the blanket and and turn around so we can cuddle
my half pit is the exact same she throws a fit if she doesnt get her toy and blanket when she lays down
pitbulls arent cute they are dangerous most injured or even dead children due to dog attacks were attacked by pitbulls gt their experience highlights some important characteristics of complex dog bites in children including the finding that pit bulls are the breed most commonly involved particularly in more severe injuries surgery was required in about half of injuries caused by pit bulls three times higher than the rate for other breeds of the nine children who required extended hospitalization six were bitten by pit bulls complex dog bites in children ‚Äì experience and recommended treatment
i ‚ù§Ô∏è reading comments about people spoiling their pets
have you noticed lately that animals are becoming more like people and people are becoming more like animals
the most dangerous dog breed in the world ladies and gentlemen tremble in fear
oh god i want to squish the cheeks ‚ù§ my pitty will not sleep without goodnight cuddles from either me my husband or our bulldog
what is with pittys and needing to be tucked in mine too friend at work has to tuck theres in in bed with them too
my roommates own a pit and any time they leave out of town over night you can find that pit legit demanding to be cuddled in my bed i have no complaints
my aunt s pitty has to sleep in her rubber duck pajamas she just loves being squeezed while she sleeps kinda like humans that like weighted blankets
also have blue pibbie can confirm she too cuddles covered on the bed with her blankie when it s night night time
my pup sheldon is the same when i get in bed he ll sit up and wait at the end of the covers until i let him under
lol my pittie has that same ball although hers is all chewed up no longer squeaks and is missing the tennis ball inside
my staffy girl won‚Äôt sleep until she‚Äôs been tucked in up to her ears and given a kiss on the forehead she‚Äôll just sit and whine until she gets those things
i thought you put an onion next to it to make the the dog cry
for my dachshund it depends on weather when it s cold he demands to be under the covers with me
thought this was my friends pit for a second he has to be tucked in too
my year old staffy has to be told to go to his own bed wait for me to pet his head until he tucks himself in winds down and snores right away for the rest of the night
pete s parents saw this on the front page and are very happy about all the love turns out he has an ig profile with followers lt petethebluedog
my grandma had this exact printed blanket when i was a child and she passed away this last year are these for sale anywhere i would love to get my hands on one
what a spoiled boy he is can t help but think about how these are the descendants of wolves my lab s just the same
dogs who get the squish face when they lay their heads down are my weakness
pull a shirt out of the hamper and keep it next to this little guy so he can smell his owner until they come home
awww he s a big sweetie even if the headline of this post is an outright lie and the pic itself is probably someone else s
dang i posted something exactly like this not so long ago i guess i didn‚Äôt post at the right time
cute puppy on a side note i had that very same blanket at my grandmas house and i haven‚Äôt seen one like it let alone the same exact one puppy deserves all the warmth
sometimes you need a break from being such a big bad pitty
can t sleep without tucking in to a toddler s face more like
for the love of god and everything holy tuck him in
my family s late pittbull used to not want to go to sleep unless we put her blanket on her and tucked her in too üòÇ bless them
of all breeds pitbulls to me always seem the most likely to just sit up and start talking full sentences
ah yes the fierce pit bulls with their aggressive cuddling and clumsy stride i can see why it is feared by many
i was taking care of two staff pitbull pups for a while my two oldest sisters got them though the younger one let me keep one after they moved away because she was having a kid and didn t want to end up with not giving the dog enough attention and these pups slept in a small room in the house kept the door shut so they wouldn t cause mayhem in the night only problem was you had to sit there until they went asleep before quietly tip toeing out if either pup woke up then you better sit your ass back down unless you wanna listen to the loudest whining you have ever heard in your life
aww how cute my pound lab mix sleeps in our queen bed i always end up on the edge though but ilm warm in the winter so it s okay lol
i ve had this exact same blanket for years since i was a kid and its followed me everywhere any slim chance you can settle an argument and remember how where you got it
my dog is like this used to love being under the covers on our bed but now that she s older she can t quite make the jumps on or off the bed safely these days so we got her a comfy floor bed and started wrapping her up like a little burrito
aw that s awesome i found a stray that was sorta feral and dirty luckily she was young enough where she turned into a lovely cat only issue was she was a lot younger than our other cat that just wanted to chill instead of play
he s such a beauty too i have an ex feral cat too it took years but now she s also a snuggle bunny like yours üôÇ
if you ever betray him he will become doubly super feral and will never trust anyone again
some photos make me instantly do that quick mmm sound when i see an animal doing something cute this is one of those photos
that may be typical of cats because it‚Äôs pretty much the same story with my cat
veterinarian here please if you try the adopt a feral cat makes sure to bring them for an examination immediately feral cats can carry diseases harmful to both themselves and humans and they have a strong desire to watch me pee
he s your best friend hey and he loves you so much he s got a soft tummy and it s heaven to touch he s your best friend yes oh what a great day his heart is full of love and i m here to say that s your best friend what he s loving his life please hug on him forever because you are his wife
we have one of those a stray i captured and brought in after feeding him for months hid under the loveseat for god knows how long he‚Äôs living the good life now and he‚Äôs sweet as pie
i dont blame him good for you for taking care of him
i think it is you who came out of your shell and you who hid under the sofa madam what a marvellous feline
my grandmother took in a fairly feral kitty that started showing up at her back door she never had a cat before age or so she had the cat for about twelve years and it was so skittish that it never let me close enough to pet her but she was so enamored with my grandmother and jumped into her lap as soon as she would sit down i think they know who rescues them üò≠
serious question how do you potty train a semi feral cat that hides under the couch for months
that s sort of what happened with my little girl late fall this year we had what we thought was a kitten hanging around the house my wife and daughter started feeding her one day i was walking into the house at the start of a snowstorm and the cat started rubbing against my leg so i took her inside took her to the vet and it turned out she was probably closer to two and just malnourished she hid for quite a while and had to be coaxed out but would snuggle now she won t leave me alone and it s very cute by far the most affectionate cat that i ve ever had
that‚Äôs a baby who knows he‚Äôs loved to the moon and back
in that light you look a lot like kate beckinsale if people have told you this many times i apologize
listen here sarah do you know how easy it would be for me to end your existence but dont worry i like you cat
gotta love it when the wild ones come around my youngest was full feral scared of everything spent the first month or so with me having a heckin startle at everything and screeching when touched now he s thirteen pounds of pure annoying cuddlebug who always has to be figuratively glued to my side i do love that right bastard
this is seriously the exact same situation with my white cat he is the most loving cat ever when he isn t meowing his lungs out at am
all of our cats were feral kittens it just takes time and not letting a bunch of visitors in get them used to their owner s first then meet guests is our best rule for when we get new cats
i adopted a stray about two years ago and she s terrified of plastic bags my only thought is that maybe someone put her in one or something awful like that but it could be anything does yours have a similar reaction
our george was like that too and he is the hands down most loving animal i know he won t venture far from one of the bedrooms he resides in but if you go to him he talks and hugs and is the sweetest thing ever
aww he just needed to know he was safe thank you for adopting a cat others would pass by without seeing
i got my cat because he was being rejected from his cat colony he s half blind has stomatitis and megacolon and at that point in his life he was less than a year old after lots of terrified vet visits and months of him hiding under stuff he eventually warmed up to me he s the sweetest and loves all other cats even if they don t like him he s made it to years old so far he has an adopted daughter now who is as sweet and skittish as he is and came from another inhospitable cat colony if she ever notices her papa is in another room without her she s cry until he runs back to her with how anxious they both are they d never be adopted out of a shelter
i once had an incredibly reclusive cat once a friend who wrote too much patchouli came and stayed with us for a few days the cat would not have anything to do with anyone that wasn t me or my wife so she would avoid my friend at all costs after the second day of my friend s stay i noticed the cat smelled like patchouli so at night she was sleeping on the couch with my friend such a little faker
all we desire beyond water food and shelter is connection
i‚Äôve got a feral but i can‚Äôt get close to her she will sit near me outside and i think she considers my house her home as she comes back every day but i can‚Äôt pet her at all if i hold my hand out she will sniff but that‚Äôs all i so badly want to be able to pet her she‚Äôs been here for or years
similar story to my dad s cat my dad adopted a year old cat from the shelter marty the cat wasn t a stray but did definitely have trust issues he hid in the basement for months finally we got him upstairs and blocked off the basement marty hid behind the couch but at least he was getting more exposure to people over the course of a couple more weeks something switched and he became a snuggly lap cat who follows my dad around everywhere
he looks just like my cat a flamepoint siamese got an orage patch on his back and orange on his tail i can see yours has a spot on his her back but does their tail have orange on it
our jeb likes to sleep either like this or with his chin resting on your cheek his brother just sleeps on top of you the cat paralysis is real
my heart it melts my gf moved into her condo about years ago turns out the family that lived there left their cat behind that‚Äôs the condo kitty now but it‚Äôs an outside cat and semi feral she is distrustful but continues to stay around visiting my gf‚Äôs balcony every now and then she has let me pet her a few times so my gf was jealous she would never let me gf get close but that‚Äôs been changing lately so we‚Äôll see anyway congratz on the absolutely adorable gent
i capt er adopted a semi feral cat too a black one he always sleeps right next to my head and is super vocal if i snuggle him he meows at me every time i say his name
white feral cats are the cuddliest little shits ever my white guy yoda was handed to my wife in a shoebox while working at dunkin donuts and told if you don t take it ill dump him this little pound fluff guy didn t really sleep without my wife but finally fell asleep with after a week that night he slept on my head
rescue cats are the best i‚Äôve had three and they all loved to cuddle
i have almost the exact same story with a calico i adopted over two decades ago she died at the ripe old age of
had a puppy just like that tasha i miss her so much
i had a cat find its way into my basement with a litter of kittens i fed them until they left then months later the mother showed up again she started off just hissing at me from the broken window from where she got into the basement now she wont leave my side gets real uppity if i close a door without her in the room with me
i ve had about cats in total of them now that have been feral street cats imo they are the best since they learn to appreciate you more for taking them in
my cat was exactly the same except he hid behind the sofa for over a year it didn t help that i already had a cat now he sleeps on top of my head
don t worry they all come around eventually mine took around years to sleep next to me on the couch
i just recently was adopted by a stray yes you read that correctly and it took her a while to get comfortable with coming inside last night was the first time she was okay with staying in our place all night and i woke up to her sleeping on my chest give them time and as long as you love them they‚Äôll come around good on ya
same thing happened with ours we adopted her because we live on a farm and had mice she now spends more time indoors than out but we don t have mice anymore
both of my cats were feral the first one was only weeks old when i found her so the transition to indoor cat was easy but the second one was around months old and took a couple of months
i once found a tiny feral kitten in the woods behind my house all skin and bones i took her in and fed her in the first five days she gained in body weight she was friendly at first and then went weird finally disappearing on me entirely i couldn t find her for two weeks and i lived in a small house the only reason i knew she was still around was because she was using the litterbox and eating the food i left out each night then one night maybe around am i drifted awake and heard this weird sound right beside my head i turned over and there was this cat lying on the pillow beside me purring from then on she behaved mostly like a normal housecat cats are weird
i knew someone who adopted a cat just like that he just referred to her as ninja kitty for so long that i don t even know her actual name at this point it was at least a month or two of him only catching fleeting glimpses of her when she d come out for food or water she is solid grey so she d just blend into the night she has since come around
much karma to you for saving this kitten s life i ve been supplementing the food of four ferals on my way home from work walking it took a long time before they would come close after a couple of months one is pretty friendly and the others will come up pretty close floof comes up and bats at me for food but her nails are sharp last week i noticed two two small kitten with one of the adults i guess i really should knock on the door of the house where i feed them and see if i can do tnr the life of a feral cat is not a great life i already have three
just buried my year old two days ago miss her dearly
my cats been with for a about years im lucky if a get to hold her for seconds on the other hand though she loves licking me
i can only imagine his thought process i bet he was super surprised at how gentle and kind you were then started getting bolder and at one point realized holy man she wants to give me pets as much as i love them this is awesome
awe such a grateful little dude i think that s what i love most about all my little rescues i love seeing the loving animals they turn into when given the chance it makes my heart just melt
we have a nd cat that was from a similar background he hid in a closet for weeks and now he won t stop getting in our faces like yours is there lol strong work
that‚Äôs cat love baby nothing else like it loyal till the end wish more humans were like ‚Äòem enjoy your treasure
i see cats on this pic lemme see if i bait the one who posted
what impresses me is that feral that have become semi tame cats and of course cats in general who are even if completely non feral can still be standoffish understand that if you are friends with their friends they will treat you with less suspicion i have seen this many times that cats are very interested in your attitude towards strangers and only after you tell them the new person is okay will they approach that stranger
he has such a beautiful face in this picture so serene
i have been lucky enough to talk to a lot of feral rehabbers one of the wonderful ladies that i met that worked with kittens as a majority told me that almost always the kitten in the pack that is the most hateful untrusting and mean is the one who falls the hardest to quote her they usually end up as the best of the bunch if there were such a thing
great job i am sure you used patience kindess and understanding to turn that kitten around fear is hard to melt any other way
our clara black and white long haired floof was feral and terrified and dangerous now she is the cuddliest one
i had a similar experience where my cat would hide in the basement for months and only come up to eat when we were sleeping now she begs for treats everyday at couch time at and nuzzles into my armpit at bedtime such a sweet girl
mine‚Äôs still in the same cardboard box two months on only coming out for food instead of cuddling she likes to cut me open
it really does take some time to earn a cats trust all the cats i‚Äôve ever had were strays my new cat donut jr took months to warm up to me after momma donut had him in my backyard it started small him completely avoiding me and waiting in the shadows while i filled up the food bowl outside then as time went on he would make himself visible but keep his distance slowly he got closer and closer as time went on and he got older i was then able to extend my hand outside of the back door and he would approach sniff it and i would sneak a pet or two in sometimes he accepted it sometimes he didn‚Äôt then one day as i left the back door open cuz i was cleaning the water bowl he walks in and begins to explore the house he was so fascinated by the smells i think and the colors and decor maybe even the cooler temperature as well i followed him around as he did so and i think he got lost cuz he was meowing while looking around and so i had to convince him to follow me back which my version of convincing is literally me talking to him saying ‚Äúc‚Äômon the outside is this way ‚Äù it took a bit but he eventually followed me back and he ran out the door it wasn‚Äôt long till he was rubbing himself on my hand and then rubbing himself on my legs and now i can pick him up cuddle him and all that other fun stuff it just took time momma donut still won‚Äôt get close to me though she‚Äôll meow and keep her distance but won‚Äôt let me pet her
you have been given the gift of a feral cat s trust that s special that s really special
there is no greater experience in the world than earning the trust of a feral animal enjoy this most amazing bond lt
you changed a life of misery into a happy life we need many more people like you
aww he‚Äôs so adorable and seems so proud of his outfit
if this is just outside the marriot then the ladies got a newer one
i don t know what it is but it s cute and i want one
i‚Äôm from peru and there was an earthquake yesterday didn‚Äôt you feel it
is that the one in the courtyard of the marriott in cusco
bitch i m fabulous and did i say you could talk to me seriously adorable i will say
hope the people are safe i loved my trip to peru two years ago
weird i have a pic of me with what i think might be the exact same alpaca in the exact same spot cuzco
i almost scrolled past this there is still good in this miserable wolrd
i was hoping it was about me but i ll concede to this guy
i was literally just in peru a week ago and i saw so many adorable baby alpacas
her name is panchita she chills out in the jw marriott courtyard area and is very friendly and will pose for pictures ps has anyone here ever smelled something worse than llama alpaca breath
i thought that was a very weird looking bird at first until i clicked on the post
alpaca my bags and be right there with pat pats for you books flights to peru
her tiny head is almost perfect circle lt squeals in delight gt
you gonna take the obligatory machu picchu selfie for your tinder profile
ah yes peru were they burn desiccated cuties for good fortune
are alpacas normally this small or have i been living under a rock
soy peruano y los animales aqu√≠ no siempre se ven tan bonitos como esta belleza
cusco is my favorite city in peru but then so is huaraz and lima and yarinacocha they are all wonderful places with wonderful people
it looks so smug lol it knows we know that it‚Äôs cute
baby alpacas were by far my favourite part of peru yes over machu picchu and pisco sours
the marriott in cuzco i saw that babe three weeks ago there i can t remember the name panchita
i visited peru last year that was when i learned that everything‚Äôs always better with alpacas
one of the most entertaining things i saw i peru was a local woman pick up an almost full grown alpaca and run across the street with it to chase a group of tourists but yeah these things are so darn cute and they brush them every day to keep them fluffy
"my family is from peru this is so cute
my mom will be so happy when i show her this peru is not mentioned often in social media"
i met this little guy in cusco as well his name is panchito and he‚Äôs the cutest
i‚Äôm pretty sure i went to that exact same hotel was there a kind old woman with her
one of my favorite animals my first encounter with one i got too close to a fence and one started licking my head it seemed to like me and was really nice until my friend walked up which seemed to cause it to get pissed off and repeatedly spit at him until he left as someone who doesnt really like to talk to people i felt that reaction on a very visceral level
llama llama no pajamas he‚Äôs sitting here waiting for his karma
i remember being a kid going to ecuador with my mom and falling asleep in the back of the pickup truck going up and down mountains waking up occasionally to spot llamas being herded the llamas were so cute
what are those tassle thingys around her neck called
whenever i see per√∫ mentioned in any sense i m so proud per√∫ foreva
don t know the story on this sweet little thing but using animals for entertainment is never an aww for me
oh my gosh i have an almost identical picture is this at the jw marriott in cusco
this is such an adorable sight i would frame this lol
i do declare that if you look at the ear as if it s a beak and hide the face of the llama it s a very convincing bird
his name is wolfgang he loves house music and off trail hiking
her post on instagram would say feeling cute might delete later
the llama has collected all infinity floods it s all over
no wa ay hahah i stayed at the same hotel and saw the same lama
oh my goshhhhh being both peruvian and super obsessed with llamas and alpacas i love this so much
where s the wandering trader probably only has blue ice and lilly pads for emeralds anyways seriously cute though

looks too perfect to be real i thought it was a little stuffed animal
this hurts my eyes you don t have to blast exposure saturation and clarity to make it look good
i found a llama what a sorprise now i got a lot of materials to my craft on fornite v
when people ask ‚Äúif you could have any animal as a pet that would stay the same size forever what would it be ‚Äù this would me the answer
i love alpacas live on a ranch where we raised them for years i miss it sometimes
this is so adorable it just made me really happy lol i wish i could have this cutie as a tattoo so i could look at them everyday and be happy
at first i thought there was a reflection of a cat in the spoon before i realized it was peanut butter
sorry the pb really thin on a plate takes a lot more time for them to clean off and better still buy a dremel tool and the little drum sander bit you will never cut your dog s quick again and their nails are nice and smooth
i only wish my dog had paws and claws of normal size that would be a breeze i have a lb st bernard blood hound his nails are insane huge and so thick i cut them and cringe it s a choir and of course he s the biggest baby acting like i just cut a paw off lol it s harder on me than him
amazing pic my cat may be an asshole he hasn t let me give him a bath since he was a baby yrs ago but he licks my hands whenever i give him a pawdicure weirdo
if you have a puppy play with his paws and ears etc often to desensitize them to it my old boy lays right down and let s me trim his nails for as long as i need he literally couldn t care less our puppy that we got at mo who had a rough early life and is afraid if everything is a different story
we can t be together bork bork but sad whine don t make it harder than it is sad bork
they look like one is getting ready to move away i imagine the other one saying no matter where they take you i ll find you
these guys are so cute üòç on a side note is it me or the brown dog is buff as hell
that husky or malamute idk could definitely jump the fence if it wanted to

pop them to the vet as soon as you can they will likely be full of worms which a dose of revolution can fix take a poop sample if you can get one too so they can run a fecal it‚Äôs likely that their mama is around consider seeing if you can trap her and have her spayed so she can‚Äôt have more babies all the best with the little ones

terrorifyingly cute cute enough to make up a convenient word
‚Äúah your awake your the one who tried to cross the border here pulls tuna can over let me get you some food‚Äù
ya know its this sort of thing that restores my faith in humanity keep being awesome
a damp warm towel does wonders for not having a mom to clean them the dog does okay too but cuties the kitty picked you
also remember they may not be able to use the restroom by themselves depending on their age i would use a qtip with warm water on it and then you can massage their privates and have them go to the bathroom the mom cat uses her tongue for that purpose but you don t want them getting backed up let me know if you have any questions i ve taken care of many a baby kitten
you have been chosen so what do you name your new cat
you‚Äôre a good person one sentient creature extending a kindness and it shows in their peaceful dream sleep
where is this magical place where pets just show up
almost named my cat theon but we went with tywin instead congrats on being adopted by two cats today what is dead may never die
did you check the area to see if there were more kittens hiding usually more than to a litter
oh that poor little guy i m so glad he and his sister are in good hands you re a wonderful person for looking after them i wish you guys luck
keep them they deserve better you re such a good person no doubt you will give them a good home
aww bless you for caring for them i have cats that wondered into our hearts after being abandoned

people need to spay neuter their cats these two are adorable but really spay or neuter folks
thats even more disgusting than a regular house kept cat
thank you for all the pictures and updates they are absolutely adorable and i m sending you all the good vibes please keep us updated as you can
this thread is like a goldmine for abandoned kitten care
to me the poignant thing is that kittens know that humans can help them i think this is instinctive now they bravely come out hoping for the best
you have been adopted by two kittens do the right thing and care for them for the rest of their lives i love their new names such cuties
rejecting a feline after it has chosen you is a sin
watch as a man is approached by a vicious mountain lion
awww my goodness well done op you‚Äôve done a great thing ‚ù§Ô∏è
thank you op you re giving me back the hope i lost in humanity take good care of them
you really had to get that nasty foot in there didn‚Äôt you

he was attracted from the cheese smell of those toe nails
i had one looking just like that come out from under the equipment trailer when i was running my first practice as coach one player who didn t have her physical done yet so was sitting on the sidelines took the kitten home and i never saw her or the kitten again
one of my cats was a stray we took in through the back window getting back up to health is a handful but it s so worth it best of luck
please check the alley just in case there is more baby s amp the mom

this is great and probably not super stressful for the animals s
literally filming animals fighting and not attempting to stop them ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
defending her food source more likely i‚Äôm the same way with pizza rolls
this is evidence that the food chain is a human construct
netflix adaptation something something idk thinks bizarre
love how the rat keeps following wherever the cat goes not sure if the cat really loves the rat or not my recently deceased cat was quite fond of rodents he showed me this as he happily crunched their bones on my front step
i used to have a rat cat and dog that all played together the cat was scared of the rat and the dog was scared of the cat so the rat was the leader and always ate first
i love it when pet families have a rhyming theme rat cat twat
this is even more adorable then her protecting a kitten
awwww i love how the rat follows the cat ‚ô° thats precious
i guess that saying is true the enemy of my enemy is a friend
times in just a few days at least they changed the title this time lol
this a dynamic where we now realise cartoons lied to us
i cant be certain since theres no sound but it looks like the dog is sneezing which can be an indication of play everyone here seems to just be playing it s cute
this reminds me when my parents would fight right in front of me
this gets reposted daily and always gets gold if you want free karma just post this folks
gonna be very honest here these type of dogs are pure cancer and everytime i see them i have an urge to kick them
"she protecc
she attacc most importantly she saves that rat from a smacc"
i like that trio so entertaining tv is overrated lol so much drama going on here so who won
yikes seeing this gives me anxiety i hope the cat and dog aren t getting hurt on the daily
or she could be protecting her lunch i get like that too when co workers and friends start asking me what i m eating
the rat probably just thought the smaller rat was its baby
god damn hippies thats the only problem seattle its like santa carla and all the vampires
aaah folk life my home city anything good happen there for this year s festival
did you see the guy with the hen she was such a good chicken
never knew the baby otter could just float so naturally like that
aw the poor little guy almost didn t pull out of it this video almost would have made for a totally different sub
lol the woman in the back definitely thinking ‚Äúha knew it ‚Äù
that looks exactly like my dog and we ve never found out what breed she is even the shelter we got her from didn t know do any of you have any idea what breed that is op
what an adorable little chonker the dog although dad is cute too
to be fair it kinda looks like he ended up with a potato instead of a dog
there s no purer love than the love between a dad and the pet they said they didn t want
i know what you assholes are thinking he s gonna eat the dog well you know what i bet he won t and then i bet you ll all feel real dumb and don t even think about questioning this man s driving skills fucking racist assholes
and now i bet he s the one always spoiling them that s how my dad was when we got our cats
the woman in the background is like aww i fuckin told you you d like it
fin fact there was research that said that looking in dogs eyes can start process making you love dogs that s why dogs trying to catch their owners eyes it s something very old and deep in our and dogs chemistry so yeah you can not like dogs but if you let yourself spend some time with dog chances are you will love them
the lady in the back ha i cooka dog fo dinna tomorrow nooo mo getting daddy s love only me tomorrow great day
i love dogs unfortunately none of my current brood like to be held like this
i find it really rude when the guy doesn‚Äôt want a dog then they get one anyways and post pictures months later when they start to like it mocking them saying ‚Äúlook here‚Äôs them with that ‚Äòdog they didn‚Äôt want‚Äô üòè‚Äù
my grandma did the same thing with our dog snickers she feared him because he was a pitbull but she ended falling in love with him and treating like a child afterwards
hmm i didn‚Äôt say ‚Äú awwww‚Äù when i saw that i said ‚Äú wtf‚Äù and that‚Äôs too long when all i‚Äôm looking for is an ‚Äú awwww‚Äù plus whats it doing make me fall in love w this thing üòÑ
my cat likes your gecko i can tell cuz she‚Äôs licking her lips
move to hawaii deal with gecko poop in your house daily not so cute anymore
very nice pineapple tie looking like a fine apple really
linda i absolutely hate you and love you at the same time cat probably
holy shit those eyes look like an icy eye of sauron
i have a cat with the most beautiful eyes i ve ever seen until today
i seriously need to get my boy a bowtie collar he d look so dapper just like your old man
beautiful i am loving all these senior cats on here lately üòç
beautiful boi where did you get the bow tie collar the quality of the fabric looks great not to mention the amazing pattern
is he blind or does he just have some wierd eye thing where he kept the blue kitten eyes
one day he will close those eyes and the whole world will miss him
looks like he had a run in with loke and the mind stone in a good way
he s obviously very well cared for to look that dapper at
reminds me of the adventure time episode when finn gets those weird blue eyes from the hermit good news is your cat will always see the good in you
it actually made me cry my cat who died on christmas at looked exactly like him he is so adorbs
these must be the ocean eyes that billie eilish is singing about üòç
his eyes look like a portal to another dimension so blue beautiful
those eyes impressed me so much man ocean in the eyes
i feel like cats with eyes like this have lived a thousand past lives
i don t think i ve ever seen a cat with blue eyes üëÄü§©üòç
wow i am just as old as this beautiful cat that is insane
he looks great for being i bet he still has a long life ahead of him
everyone here is commenting on his eyes and i can t get over his stern little mouth lookin like he gonna scold me
those eyes are so beautiful that they re annoying to look at
how do you create a relationship like this give the oragutan a bottle and let the tiger cubs into the pen
if i remember this right this orangutan had lost a baby and was very depressed the zoo keepers introduced the orphaned loan and tiger cubs and she raised them
i hate to ruin the fun but no legit animal facility would do this exploitative places stage cute scenarios like this for publicity and make up a heartwarming story about how this is really a good thing
i hope that at some point in my life i‚Äôll get to meet an orangutan
what happens when the tiger grows up is it friendly to the orangutan
i ve said it before but moms gonna mom it s what they do it could be a cat taking care of a bunny a dog and a baby duck or in this case an orangutan and a couple of tiger cubs
i ve seen too many videos of orangutan s going from to in the blink of an eye to think this is anything but a bad idea
at least the orangutan is strong enough to hold his own is they grow a human quickly falls short
if this were in the wild the tang would snap tiggers neck
which fucking zoologist is at work and comes up with the idea to have an ape feed the tiger cubs so they don‚Äôt have to
how do you not just melt at this cool as it is bizarre yet familiar i have three cats albeit not those type of cats lol
right after i finished life of pi i see this and it fucking fits
this is exactly how i feel as a step mum this gif is now the best illustration of my life
is imprintimg applicable here or should i not expect a happy ending to this story
they are dumb and bitey but they re my children and i love them
it s disgusting that we lock any animals up but orangutans especially because you know they think just like we do but because they don t communicate so it s okay to lock them away
someone call joe rogan that thing could rip its arms off on accident
i wonder how many months from that moment it will take for them to start thinking about snacking on mum
such a powerful and dangerous animal and look it has a pet kitty
this is what tarzan would be if the humans were replaced with big cats
animals just have instinct says every human without empathy
well add that to the list of things i have never seen before
other non human primates are so awesome to watch in my opinion
there s something really odd and a bit adorable in watching such behavior that you would consider to be specific to humans in another animal
y all my heart just exploded we don t deserve animals
how other people see it when you adopt a child that looks nothing like you
that orangutan is going to have some powerful allies in a couple of years i wanna see that update
her milkshake definitely brings all the bulls to the yard
the ancient greeks thought cows were beautiful they referred to hera zeus wife as being cow like in beauty meaning she had large expressive eyes hera was a little moody so people wouldn t be going around insulting her if they wanted to continue living at least in human form so she must ve been quite the looker she was also in contention for most beautiful in all the land once it didn t go well but she was one of three tl dr the greeks knew cows were beautiful and hera was scary
cows are really curious animals i‚Äôve spent time on dairies around them and i found their personalities are very inquisitive and they like routine
really sucks that in the wrld we live in today this cow will eventually be slaughtered and processed so it can be sold to a restaurant or a super market for human consumption
oh my god can we stop objectifying cows she s a real cow with desires and dreams
even from the picture those ears look like they could be made of velvet
cow nose prints are unique exactly like human fingerprints
cows are adorable and can be very silly storytime on my grandparents farm i actually liked the cows better than the dogs the dogs were very much working dogs and they were not the cuddly lovable mutts i m used to the cows seriously beyond affectionate i remember being absolutely tickled when i was a kid and one of the cows kept coming up to me bonking me in the chest with its head and sticking its tongue out finally figured out she wanted me to pull on her tongue when i did it she d do that thing where they raise their head and shake their necks while prancing a tiny bit then she d bonk me and stick her tongue out again weird totally adorable i definitely think so
i wouldn‚Äôt have noticed it without you pointing it out but yes she is a very beautiful cow
my great grandfather owned a farm with lots of cows and my childhood home was next to a field full of cows we drove my mom crazy because we would go into the field to play with them and forget to close the gate she would look out the kitchen window and just see a cow chilling at our swing set
best cow portrait i‚Äôve ever seen those ears and that huge nose thanks for posting
you guys know what happens to cows at the end of a county fair right
is she wearing masrcara or does she just have amazing eyelashes
we need more cows on this sub seriously underrated adorableness
how can people not love cows look at those eyes that nose those ears she s perfect
cow is the cutest the long eyelashes the big innocent eyes the big moist nose the flapping ears adorable
she looks like a doll i miss showing cattle so much
we went on a cycling holiday in jersey some time ago my non pet owning husband ‚Äòi‚Äôm not into cats and dogs‚Äô fell in love with all the cows there it took us three times as long to ride a short distance as he wanted to stop and scratch the ears and talk to every cow we passed
whomever decided flesh colored mud boots were a grand idea was incorrect
when i was growing up my sister significantly older loved cows i never understood until i got older they re like big beautiful dogs but better
imagine someone telling you that you have the softest ears
it looks like her left ear our right has an extra eye staring out of it
i would boop that snoot so fast you d have fresh un pasteurized milk in your fridge about seconds later
anybody else see the robed cthulhu with a glave behind the adorable cow
think about this next time you eat part of a dead one at mcdonalds i won‚Äôt condemn you for eating meat but you‚Äôre a damn hypocrite if you say this is cute then proceed to eat one
she is beauty she is grace she is miss united states
we as a human race should really stop doing what we do to these sentient beings and any sentient being in general we really did create a hell for them on this planet i really don‚Äôt mean to preach but look at this beauty
literally do not understand how someone would want to kill and eat this
we need more moo moo appreciation like this she‚Äôs a beaute
cows are actually quite adorable i taught myself to play guitar to a trio of my neighbor s cows every time i would start to play they would come running over to the fence
and then you kill them dont you take them there to auction them off to be killed or am i wrong genuinely curious bc when i was growing up my best friend would do h and every year she would pick and animal and we would both get close to it then the fair would happen and she d come home with money call me naive but i didnt know what was happening not till about i got curious one year and asked what makes an animal place anyway she said well the fatter the pig the better then it clicked so i just find it super weird when people at shows post cute animal like you know what s gonna happen to them
every time i see a cow i feel like crying i have to figure out how to become a vegetarian
i‚Äôm becoming obsessed with cows they‚Äôre basically giant dogs
there‚Äôs an expression where i come from ‚Äùthe cow with the biggest udders has the most farmers pulling on her teets ‚Äú
not everyone is into cows i mean i guess if they are consenting to it
my favourite gif of the year is the one with the queen getting excited and pointing at cows bless her
i just got back from a road trip ended up being sick the whole time but driving back i couldn‚Äôt help but feeling for the cows out there about how beautiful and alike we are and one day i want to fall in love with a cow
time for new habbits can we all start eating meat way less i m not saying go full vegeterian
i honestly just hate you for framing a being who has more integrity than you ever will as ‚Äúnot everyone‚Äôs into cows ‚Äù god i hate you
well they are cute that is why they have the kuhkusschallenge
y all love to dote on cute animals but then it s dinner time and y all like fuck this animal now slit its throat for my enjoyment
my husband actually called me a cow before i was extremely offended until he explained that he was trying to tell me i have beautiful eyes hehehe
she knows how to bat those eyelashes and look really pretty classy lady ‚ù§Ô∏è
awww the meat producer i know says she doesn t pat her cows they look mighty soft
it amazes me that millions and millions of these animals are killed ever month if it was puppies reddit would flip it‚Äôs shit
my god those ears look so velvety soft i just wana rub my face on them
cows are awesome they moo they make milk they re adorable
i went to our local agricultural fair with my friend and our toddlers about years ago and as we were walking through the cow barns i saw a really unique looking bull that was all shiny and perfect and well behaved and being a farm girl myself it just seemed a remarkable specimen so i said wow that s a handsome steer i really didn t think anything of it until she looked at me sideways and then burst out laughing did you just call that a handsome steer she kept laughing for an hour i still get bugged about it to this day
cows without predators starve to death humans provide the predation
"nosey cow doo doo doo doo doo doo
nosey cow doo doo doo doo doo doo
nosey cow doo doo doo doo doo doo
nosey cow"
to be honest the eyelashes of that cow look better than some human
anyone know what breed of cow she is just curious i was thinking maybe brown swiss or jersey i dont know i took a food animal class in college where we learned all the breeds but i never really got the hang of it other than the chik fil a cows are holstiens lol
who are these fucking people who aren t into cows i d like to take them to a stamp ede
it really saddens me that everyone is going on about how cute she is yet youre all probably still eating dairy meat
okay well i wasn‚Äôt referring to the cows commodity she produces milk either way and she‚Äôs precious so she‚Äôs a precious milky child i don‚Äôt give a shit if you down vote me or not reddit isn‚Äôt the end all be all of life it‚Äôs just a website so if you‚Äôre hoping to shame me for something i wasn‚Äôt even trying to do it‚Äôs not going to work asshat
growing up kids in my middle school used to say the nose of a cow was used for the playstation joystick controller i believed that longer than i want to admit
guess we all just accept the demon standing right above her as normal
she s an absolutely beautiful moo puppy and i love her
so in a few years are you gonna reveal that hes secretly been gay this entire time
dumbledore more like dumble adore haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
smoothie is quite possibly the most beautiful creature to ever grace this planet
looks like it could have weasely antics based on those eyes mega pretty though
i need to go to bed i was watching this for five seconds before i realized it wasnt actually moving
wtf does smoothie have to do with dumbledore are you calling her gay
that‚Äôs no dumbledore thats crookshanks all glammed up
this puss has been reposted more than kim kardashian s
does he send young cats on extremely dangerous missions he could handle for no reason other than his own mercurial insanity
it looks like it has hulk hogans handlebar moustache below his chin
i just realized what was dumbledore‚Äôs animal transformation
she s smoothy the cat you can search the same on instagram
what do you mean you re not ugly you and vader look great
fix your crooked glasses and you d be golden and it s almost impossible for cats to be ugly so both of you are great d
you and the cat look exactly how i and my cat looked about years ago now i‚Äôm pretty handsome it all changes with the haircut btw your cat looked exactly like my cat ollie
vader is a phenomenal name choice also you are a hella handsome lil dude don t let anyone tell you different
you look really young here s one thing you need to know if you re a teenager or even younger you haven t hit adulthood yet puberty isn t adulthood your facial features take years to settle even if you think you look ugly it might not be the same in future because adult features are pretty different from that of a teenager s while it seems like everyone around you is effortlessly pretty and handsome it isn t the case the cat loves you clearly and that s good enough
my black cat was also named vader üòç you re both adorable
whatever somebody wants to get with you anyway i just googled i think henry cavill is unattractive same for brad pitt apparently they re ugly too awww kitteh
whoever made you believe that in yourself can t see the love inside of you that vader knows
my guy if you listen to what other people think before what you think then you aren t gonna do that great in life have more confidence in the way you do things because there is someone who does like you our there or there will be someone because the world is a big place with a lot of people
dude you aren t ugly take care of yourself eat right and exercise you have a long road ahead of you make the right decisions for future you and you ll be great i m envious of you being at your stage in life enjoy it
i‚Äôve seen a lot of cute on here today this tops all of it
has anyone ever had a hamster that didn t bite the shit out of them for no reason because i sure haven t
i‚Äôm sorry but i kind of half expect to see the kitty version of chris hansen step out any second
looks like he wants to be a little more than friends
kitten is thinking i don t mind being really friendly with you but what are you
are hamsters just like super fat mice they so cute we don t have them where i m from nz
kitten doesn t know what to do with the fluffy ball
he has no idea the cutthroat killer is he getting involved with kitten needs to watch that hamster
yo the hell is this furry potato doin what s going on
i have experience with gerbils which seemed like mindless and vicious animals who did not relate to humans much i could be wrong maybe i was too young to appreciate them hamsters look to be more aware intelligent
arthur i have an orange cat and a gray cat and i m very sad that i didn t name them arthur and merlin or maybe leonardo because he kinda looks like leonardo dicaprio too
i know it sounds really weird but i swear my last fur kids have directed me to what their names should be like i was dead set on naming my ferret ivan the terrible after his god awful trip home in the car but it never stuck with him somehow ended up with koda my cat was supposed to be bastet but she wouldnt respond to it so i had this thought that since she was the black cat of her litter i had to name her a name meaning darkness she s rajani now and knows her name very well she responded from the first time i called her by it my point is don t sweat it i seriously think animal have a way of telling you what their names are supposed to be
so cute they all wait for the last one to catch up at the end ‚ù§Ô∏è
just the thought of some ducks having their entire life cycle revolve around a highschool is just crazy
this makes me not as uneasy when i think about my pet duck flying away and never returning
okay so things are about to take a turn some dudes are about to wave some boards at you just try to ignore them although ignatius is irrepressible i see you ignatius yeah we re coming through ugh okay so keep close and let s good
the sound of the dogs makes me nervous for the ducky family
kids i m showing you the human civilisation ppl are nice here then we will go to swim follow me close
make way for ducklings the made for tv version ‚ù§Ô∏èüíïüß°
look at those so adorable i ll be honest when heard the barks background i get scared million times to thank those good staff
i held my breath until they were all safe in the water
this happens at the bozeman highschool in montana too it s really lovely
do ducks live for years is this the same duck each year with new ducklings i didn t know they lived that long unless it s passed on as knowledge between mum and babies so it keeps going so many questions
that looks like my old middle school we had the same thing going on
we do that at my former highschool in upstate ny too
cue the graduation montage while walking through the halls
i rlly hope this has become a thing where the school makes an announcement that the ducks are here and the highschoolers go outside and cheer when they reach the lake from a respectable distance of course
so either that duck has been incredibly successful at spreading its genes or they live in some kind of duck simpsons sitcom where they never age
the way they fumble around then speed up to catch back up
it s crazy the ducklings have stayed that small for years
this help will cost you one duckling the cutest payment of all
üé∂ a duck walked up to a lemonade stand and he said to the man running the stand‚Ä¶ üé∂
i wonder there is always that duckling falling behind not or but always hmmm
brace yourselves my children the mama duck looked upon her ducklings and said for we are about to pass through the land of the giants it s a dangerous territory but we have made a truce with them if we follow their rules no harm shall come to us and for the last years we ve kept peace between them and us and the mama duck looked to the sky and murmured may we keep that peace for more years
til ducks can raise more than generation of ducklings
this really looks like the high school i went to but i can t be certain because they only show the ground it looks like the exact same carpet and tile work with the rounded edges same speckled tiles i gotta research further and figure it out every year these ducks would land in a small courtyard in the middle of the high school there was no access to the rest of the world except through the halls of the high school they would lock the court yard when the ducks were there and when it was time they would escort them out they would have to do this every year maybe it s more common than you would think
wait are you telling me that ducks lifespan is gt years
we used to do the same thing somewhere i used to work the ducks would nest in a courtyard and the only way out was through the building it was the same mama duck i think because every year she would tap on the glass when she was ready to leave
it would take a lot in me to not to kidnap one of the babies kidding of course but i reaaaaally want a duckling
so is the duck over years old or is this a jojo type deal where it travels through the generations
in the s they built schools with little court yards in the middle of the school structures some has little water features grass little trees the only access was through the school hallways ducks love them and kids love to watch as it is all glass walls around the court yard
someone should have caged the ducklings to see the mom s reaction
so adorable and the compassion shown toward the ducks is such a good example for the students
or maybe it only happened once and the video is just posted once a year wait no its reddit it would have been posted much more often than that
their first time swimming yet they instinctively knew what to do evolution is awesome
this makes me think of my school we have a little locked of area with a pond and almost every year we get ducks i believe that this year we might have gotten sets of ducklings but i m not too sure about that
this is me every morning giving way to a few mothers and ducklings cross the road there‚Äôs a lagoon by my house and there‚Äôs a road right next to it on the opposite side of the road there‚Äôs a massive tree that they seem to love to hang out under
my school has a courtyard that almost every year a duck would lay eggs in and live there until the ducklings could fly away one year the ducklings were in the wrong courtyard it didn t have a pond and the teachers had to herd the ducks to the right one
so these ducklings didn‚Äôt age and stayed ducklings for years
i love ducks such a sweet looking comical bird nothing like geese or as we call them hereabouts the devil s flying shit machine
important question why have those little ducklings not gotten any bigger after years
school alarm goes off a voice is heard over the pa emergency duck protocal initiate operation quack patrol
it s good to see and also hear about people helping animals cute little ducklings üòçüòä
she looks like she wants to say to them can you humans please stop following us i know which way to go
yrs same duck and ducklings don‚Äôt the duckling grow up i‚Äôm confused
how tf do ducks keep those babies safe one year a pair of ducks different breed had almost babies and i have no idea how they managed
there s a duck crossing near where i work and the ducks cross the street near a very heavily trafficked intersection there s one of those duck crossing signs and everything everytime i drive through there and i stop for the ducks crossing i can t help but have a huge stupid grin on my face as i watch the ducks and be in awe of all the people who stop and wait for the ducks to do their thing
where‚Äôs the dad the ducks in australia have both parents with them raising the ducklings ü§î
this exact same thing happens at my high school every year ol skittles comes by and waddles down to the lake
i see that cbc watermark does that mean that the birds drink tim hortons
i was thinking this is something canadians would do then i saw the cbc logo and my suspicions were relived
bro that is awesome my only worries though is some asshole teen might hurt the ducks god dude it actually worries me
is it messed up that once the initial aww wore off my next thought was that one day hopefully not soon that momma duck won t pass through anymore how long do fucks live
this isn‚Äôt just cute this is fascinating i‚Äôm surprised that they don‚Äôt just go around the high school but also amazed that they know that somebody will let them in
this is pretty high up on the list of all the best things to start your day with
i ve said it before and i ll say it again mother ducks are the worst mothers
who put this recorded footage of hamilton s monaco run on here
years how long do ducks live can it really be the same mother duck
that s an old duck years of babies man kudos to her
i had this duck on my way to work for many years every year she chilled with her ducklings on the ditch that gathered water on the mornings i commuted to work as the summer went on she had each day fewer and fewer ducklings it was always so sad
is it ‚Äúonce a year‚Äù the same momma duck with different babies somehow the math isn‚Äôt working for me but what do i know about ducks
i can imagine that the refugees would kill them all lets k em all
this actually happened at my school growing up too there was a courtyard in the middle with no access to the rest of outside unless you walked through the school or flew in as ducks do every year a duck would nest there and when her babies hatched they d walk them through the school and out to a pond across the street
awww they all waited for the last one to catch up so cute
wouldn t the ducklings be much much bigger after years it can t possibly be the same family of ducks
wait until this happens with geese all they do is peck on the glass door inside the school s courtyard until they are let out
how big is that school that if it takes years to walk out
how long do ducks live does this means the ducks i ve been feeding since i was were the same ones for a long time is that why they let me pet them i have so many questions
it would be so hard not to kiss every one of those little boops on the head
i wonder if the mother thinks this is the most dangerous scary part of the trip while we are all here thinking its adorable
that must be an odd day for the school just once a year the pa system comes on amp x b attention students and faculty today is duck day please remain in your classrooms until further notice
wait this raises much more questions is it the same mama duck each year how long do ducks even live does it take place during school time and if so are the time tables changed so students won t get in the way wouldn t the ducklings want to take the same route when they are mama ducks themselves wouldn t that lead to duck parade
mamaduck and her kids visiting the zoo ‚Äû and here the humans stack their children in rows for some reason‚Äú
they did this at my old highschool too we had a courtyard in the middle of the school the school was one big square with a pond and ducks would come back every year and lay their eggs and hatch them then we d have to escort them theough the school
so great to see one time my dad and i were driving back from a dentist appointment in heavy washington dc traffic there was some commotion and slowdown at an intersection and when we drove up there was a mother duck and her ducklings trying to cross the road and there were cars driving right by them and people pulling around stopped vehicles without seeing the ducks it was gona be grisly and my dad was ready to cover my eyes then a siren rang out and a motorcycle cop pulls up into the intersection and holds out his arms to block traffic the ducks got across and had smooth sailing through a park toward the water was pre cell phone if a photographer had been there and snapped a photo it would have been golden
ducks only have a life span of about years if this has been happening for the past years there s the chance years ago that mother duck was one of the fledglings and just returned to a safe place i don t how likely ducks are to return to the same place they were born to breed i do know many species of birds do have a migratory rout they learn from their parents maybe the duck learned a good brooding spot also
i want to kidnap the ducks just to watch the mother goose scream
my school had a duck family too they lived in an interior courtyard then one year someone thought a super cool senior prank would be killing them all that ended that adorable annual occurrence we could never have anything nice
is there a subreddit for mama ducks and babies it s so adorable
is this the same duck family from sesame street if this had been happening for ten years then maybe
i love snakes in hats what s its name nice ring by the way
what a beautiful ball python is that a banana morph
i thought durant is contractually obligated to wear nike when looking into the camera for pictures
i m usually scared of snakes but this little fella is so cute that i m not afraid to look at him her and i think that he she is adorable
didn¬¥t know i needed a snake with a hat in my life i love it
so cute yet my friend from a country far far east exclaimed when he saw he picture ‚Äùit s a snack ‚Äù
if this is op s snake what are those little black spots on it could be mites hopefully it s just a bit of dirt
poor thing it looks very scared i hope the aliens kidnap you and give you the same treatment
i don t want to be that guy but your snake looks underweight it looks like a ball python and those bois should be square ish i m not going to assume anything about your care or how you feed you boi but i always want to at least say it
‚Äúi‚Äôm a snaaaaaaake i‚Äôm a snaaaaaaaaake i‚Äôm a snaaaaaaaaaaake in a hat‚Äù
i giggled out loud because of its cuteness we need more snakes in hats
i swear that snakes face is saying ‚Äò i was once a fine snake now look at me cute snake üêç
this makes snakes much less terrifying next time i see one i m just going to imagine it wearing a tiny knit hat
i was today years old when i discovered crocheting tiny hats for boop noodles is my new calling lt lt
this little is so cute why don‚Äôt we see this more often
christmas snek is being reposted but christmas snek is so epic that it doesn‚Äôt matter
top hat party hat this hat that hat wizard hat like if you know what this is from
i‚Äôve been saying this for years dress a danger noodle and it will loose the danger
for someone who is terrified of snakes i can appreciate this cuteness
snek looks a bit embarrassed do i have to wear this please don t make me oh so cute though
it‚Äôs the most beautiful thing i‚Äôve ever seen in my life it‚Äôs a snake in a hat
when did inbreading become so fucking cute i just wana pick this little mutant up and cuddle the shit out of him
excuse me sir but do you have the time to love me me hell ya
i m used to be good looking now gaining weight finally starting to go bald i wish i looked even half as good as this beauty
immediately made me think of an old friend from back in high school he wasn t cross eyed but he looked like this cat
upvote for the poly they re so cute with their extra toes
beats being a dog with one eye three legs and a scar across his nose named lucky
that dingus family tree is more lile a bush what a loveable chunk
gg you can officially say your cat and thumbs in a good way
sugar coat it all you like this is just a case of unsupervised siblings
the single most adorable walking recessive gene i ve ever seen
so from the pic and title i will take a guess at the name amp x b lucky
my grandpa has a very similar looking cat white fur with some light blond blue crossed eyes he s a little shit burglar and a glutton wonder if those are inbreeding signs
too many chromosomes be like dies of breeding coefficiency related diseases
"it was a cross eyed toed no tail wise floof cross eyed toed no tail wise floof cross eyed toed no tail wise floof
sure looks cute to me üòä"
i say the extra toes makes him more stable on his feet üòÅüíô
bobtail and polydactyl cats with either feature are usually very smart shit this cat likely knows what you‚Äôre saying and is probably functionally literate
the wisest of floofs this one knows when where why and how i provide all of my love to him long before it happens
does being cross eyed negatively affect his her depth perception etc run into walls or miss toys with paw when playing
what an adorable kitty cat that beautiful fluffy fur looks so soft and the crossed eyes are so darn cute b would give pets
a spare parts cat these cats tend to get all of the interesting anomalies of the cat world and are the greatest things since sliced bread and keanu reeves
looks like cats banned abortions in alabama along time ago
this looks exactly like my daughter‚Äôs kitty alphonse
you could fry a god damn egg on my heart from how warm this kitten made it
i just did that silent scream one does when needing to squee but i can t make too much noise
wasn t this literally posted yesterday karma farm getting lazy
whatcha gonna do with those cute short legs waddle waddle
once your legs are the size of your ears i bet you d waddle too
too cuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuute i have not seen anything cuter
oh sweet captain wigglebeans how can you be so cute‚ÄΩ
baby is just trying to explore the area lets goooooo amp x b too cute to handle
its interesting how those fking cute cats melt my hearth every day then i look at my cats and watch them flinging and throwing arround a mouse or some geckos brutal and cute
hello police this is it this is the post that killed me no don t look at it ohh
furr real this kitten is very purr ty it can paw sibly be a good fur end
very cute but i feel like this is the rd time this month this has been posted here lol
my heart i would be so tempted to selfishly squish my hand with the kitten in it but that‚Äôs just not right i would need to squeeze someone else‚Äôs arm while holding the kitten to let off the expression of cuteness overload this kitten was waddling with motive and when it started getting petted you could tell it knew what was going on well deserved affection
tractor biscuit johnny i like objects or fandom names i d say name him after your favorite action hero or actor or singer or just a random object it ll bring you joy when you re yelling at him to stop rolling in mud ü§£
waffle because he s blonde like a nicely cooked waffle and when ever and animal here s food you have their attention
dammit now i m going to see this thing in my nightmares upvote for successfully scarring me
wish i could hug you thank you for being a good human ‚ô°
i‚Äôm confused after finding this poor hungry kitten your first thought was to pull out your phone and start filming
are you sure that she was alone maybe mom goes for sth and be back later and now can t find her children
that kitty gonna live large now and be queen or king da block saal good little kitty you do you and don‚Äôt take no shit from any cat or kitty that gets in to way represent
he was such a tiny nip nop goober all grown up and healthy awesome
oh my gosh she was so itty bitty shes such a cuddle bug now
look at her history she posted hours prior to this saying her mom‚Äôs cat had kittens
these bonds are the strongest you ll ever come across my cat was born with us but after a few weeks the mother had enough of him and wouldn t feed him anymore i had to do it i thaught him how to drink and how to eat and now he never leaves my side no bond is purer than between those of animals and the hands that brought them up
funnily enough i say the same thing about my fianc√©
imagine mommy cat coming back home from buying groceries and not finding its child
finds kitten first thing op does is take out the phone and film it yeah you found it alone and hungry my ass more like you got a kitten and left outside to film for karma
i found a kitten in a stable on its own once i picked it up worried it had been abandoned and staged some elaborate discovery outside the house so my dad would find it and we would have to raise him mistake my dad knew about the kitten in the stable and hadn‚Äôt said anything so we wouldn‚Äôt disturb mother and kitten he was put back at some point the mother cat has to find food generally predator animals have a much higher fat in their milk to sustain their young while they are off hunting it‚Äôs pretty normal to find a isolated place to hide them when they go off assuming op isn‚Äôt bs
i m not saying this is what happened but it is possible that the mother was simply out hunting and came back only to find her kitten gone
i cried and i m so thankful that you saved her thank you so much
mom probably tried to get her somewhere safe and didn‚Äôt make it ü•∫ thank you for helping
my mom handfed a kitten at my dads house before he moved out because the mother had been hit by a car and died mom even had to sit with the kitten until it fell asleep or it would meow real high until she got there again that cat followed her around everytime she was there after that don t think you can get a cat closer than that
if i ever found a starving kitten i would never leave it there breaks my heart to see animals in that condition üò¢ i have no idea how to care for a kitten that young but i guess i would have to learn if i did find one
oh myyyyyyy goooood amp x b amp x b amp x b giiiivee
we found our cat like this we thought about giving it up for adoption instead he lived with us for years
what i want to know is where do you get one of those bottles i have seen a few kittens that sometimes got abandoned and i can t really do anything for them since i don t know how to feed them someone help meee
absolutely precious thank you you awesome human being
put some sad piano music on that shit and upload to youtube that ll pay for her vet bills forever
i said awwww way too many times in the course of seconds
you are not supposed to take a kitten just because it is alone the mother has to leave to get food you are supposed to watch it for a day or two to make sure it is indeed abandoned i would check back to see if the mother is around
welp this is that happens when millennials are triggered
this needs upvoted a trillion more times what a cutie
this could potentially usurp the willy wonka tell me more meme
damn grayson looks like hedwig are they related or something
i m pretty sure this was the plot for a few pixar movies
so that s like what owl eats i wonder if any of those owls used to run deliveries for wizards
grayson found a discarded beer got blind drunk and fell out of his tree now he s getting free food from wild brethren
folsom ca my girlfriend and i were just there on saturday
grayson can hear the train a comin‚Äô it‚Äôs rollin‚Äô round the bend
anybody else read the like the girl from the beginning of talk dirty to me jason hee hee hee
and when someone drops off a ‚Äúcare package‚Äù to another human in a cage they get arrested too
stuck in folsom prison those owls keep on swoopin‚Äô and that‚Äôs when they free feed me
i think the planet will be better off when the human race collapses
i hate to break it to you that is a picture of an owl not actually a bird
grayson was in training to be the next talon for the court of owls beware the court of owls
i‚Äôm stuck in folsom prison and time keeps draggin‚Äô on but that train keeps a rolling on down to san antone
bro i see you stuck imma bring you some food amp x b bro why you still here fly away but here is some more food amp x b bro come on lets go hunt and turn our heads all the way around heres a rat amp x b bro i guess you aren t coming have a rat
owls mate for life one owl sanctuary near me has a female owl with a broken wing that never healed properly however her mate comes and visits time to time
i love the folsom zoo as a kid i remember collecting my dogs fur and putting it into this collection statue that was in the shape of a wolf for the wolves to play with i was wolf crazy as a kid and wanted to go to that zoo every damn weekend
awesome this is the first cool thing on reddit i can actually drive to and see in person
dropping dead rats in front of an animal locked up owls are so savage nobody talk or else
grayson is imprinted i think what you mean to say is grayson has become institutionalized
this is a great zoo there‚Äôs also a feral cat who lives with the bears her name is little bear
i love that reminds me of cats bringing us dead animals to teach us how to hunt
folsom people know how to put stuff on a prisoners account
i wanna be that kid so bad thank you for making my day
is it a repost yeah do i care nah beats having my feed filled with like bad news
i kid chased by a wild fluffy herd of dogs and then taken down people
trying to outrun zombies during a zombie apocalypse
he knows that life is short and it s better not to waste time for worries
man i wish i could be as much as peace as this dog is right now
i don t think this is aww i feel sorry for dogs that were bred to have nose so small their tongue doesn t fit their mouth and their brains and eyes don t fit their skull crie every tiem
took me a while to understand he wasn t eating a snake
exactly what i want to do today including the bondage
all i can think of is the sand he s going to be shedding for days you think you ve washed it all out only to discover a small pile every time they move from one place to another
hes so gently enjoying his food too my dog just divebombs into his food not even chewing half of it
i think this is the first time i‚Äôve seen a dog really holding up the food they‚Äôre eating and taking bites does this happen a lot the most i‚Äôve seen mine do is when she was laying on her stomach and had a long treat propped up between her paws while she chewed on one end
funny how at first i didn t notice he was buried in sand i though i just saw a dog with most of it s body torn off still moving ü§¢ illusion
i mean this sincerely i would die for this dog without question
yep this is a happy spot to get off reddit thanks for the smile üôÇ
good morning you little doggo pupper pupperoni dog i honestly don‚Äôt know what to say anymore
i‚Äôve seen this point post many times before i will smile and upvote every single time
can‚Äôt bear to watch i‚Äôm too nervous that he will drop his food into the sand
i love it when dogs savor a treat instead of inhaling it directly into their stomachs
this is me at am after my sleeping pill munchies have kicked in it s the best way to munch i swear
this dog is experiencing true bliss and i envy him for it
he‚Äôs adorable and he can‚Äôt breathe what a combination
already liked it like times on imgur still makes me smile
how come my dog gets so hot just going out for a walk yet i see winter dogs that‚Äôs super fluffs at the beach when it‚Äôs degrees outside in the sand how
wow i don‚Äôt think i‚Äôve ever seen a dog deliberately try to enjoy food before
that dog did something heroic in a past life to have this as his current life
just having breakfast at the beach nothing so special but idk why my owners melting maybe because of the hot sun
mine would have promptly carried it to the closest carpet to eat it this is of course assuming he doesn‚Äôt just wolf it down in two bites and almost choke himself
thought this dog was chomping a snake at first glance
are dogs gonna evolve to have thumbs and eat human food this picture says it all
this is me in bed at night eating animal crackers ü§ìüòå
lookit him living his best life way to be little doggo
thought he was disemboweled for a second i m on the wrong subreddit i guess
this is so freaking adorable i think i can justifiably say i can t even
not sure but i think that s the third eyelid if it s showing there could be some serious health issues
don‚Äôt come to reddit for medical advice if it isn‚Äôt a medical subreddit the several varying answers you got in the comments prove my point exactly who actually knows what they‚Äôre talking about
unfortunately haven‚Äôt been able to bring to vet yet
and you have no idea how much this breaks my heart that we haven‚Äôt been to the vet already just a life lesson in survival
i d never seen anything like this before i think it s really better to ask a professional hopefully the kitten will be fine
awe look at that lucky dog so awesome what some love will do for an animal rescues are the best
beautiful absolutely stunning transformation well done
he s so beautiful and healthy and happy look at that smile those ears that face
someone learned how to manipulate photos to make things look brighter
he looked so happy on the way home and now he‚Äôs scared on a couch dont know if i‚Äôd call that a win
oh no what are you going to do to me to oh boy what are we going to do today fantastic work
my dog will randomly look like either one of these every day he‚Äôll sit there looking all scared and pitiful so that i‚Äôll pet him and the second i do he turns into the second
i mean i m sure the difference is huge but there s also the dogs pose and the filters on the photo
poor baby looks so scared in the first pic so glad they found a loving home
from ‚Äúwho are you and what are you doing‚Äù to ‚Äúwhere‚Äôs our next adventure‚Äù
so what you re saying is you have a much better camera now and you want to show it off
a loving home and a loving pack does wonders special place in heaven for you my friend
took you years to get some lighting and megapixels lol
is there a sub for before and after dog pics growing up or being rescued
such a stark contrast between the eyes of an animal who only knows fear vs the eyes of an animal that now knows love and happiness lt
looks like a different dog so happy now good job and congratulations
so he went from happy dog to terrified what did you do to that poor little guy
look i hate to brag but i‚Äôm kind of an expert talking here that there is a grade a good boy you can tell him i say so
a loving home really is amazing for a dog‚Äôs saturation and contrast
the day you had an android vs the day after you bought an iphone
adorable but the quality camera filter helped a bit d still adorable
it s insane how this doesn t even look like the same dog seeing this makes me think about how this reflects in people the same way when your life brightens you really are a different person and in this case dog
nawwww that s fucking beautiful such sad eyes in the first one
man i am not a dog person but damn that is one adorable animal
seems to me like you ve got yourself one hell of a camera upgrade
our last dog pound mutt made the same transition went from scared to hey this is my place and these are my people and never seemed to lose his attitude of gratitude over his long year life always happy rip boy
sweet baby went from being scared to being loved what a lucky doggo
ahh the good old bad quality bad angle bad lighting vs professional picture
did you get that name asher from the game of thrones telltale game only time i can recall seeing it otherwise
huh funnily enough that was my dog s name when we adopted him and mine too
love the name asher i‚Äôve always said when i get a dog i‚Äôll name them asher where did you find come up with the name
plot twist the second picture is when he was adopted
how is it possible asher looks younger now than then is he benjamin button
awww yay this reminds me of mum and dad s dog he was a rescue who has a broken rib and messed up leg that were never reset and treated poor boy he was so timid around parents at first so scared now he loves to play fight with my dad sleeps of my mum s lap and when i walk through the door he s all excited and jumping and so many happy tippy taps so lovely to see the change in him and all it took was love and patience
the difference is like night and day just look at the gleem in those eyes how he went from scared to loving life to anyone adopting a pet and giving it a forever home filled with love and care you re the best kind of person
wow seven years older yet still looks younger by comparison amazing
wow that dog managed to improve the camera quality an impressive pup
please be good to me today i love you you are always so good to me
happy dog with a good home enjoy make fun memory s üíï
awwwww my puppy is named asher too he s a bit bigger and probably dumber though
thank you for giving her a wonderful loving home she s beautiful
you can see just from the coat and how it s looking at you how well it s been taking care of and the love
i think we can all agree you have done a wonderful job and are wonderful people and doggos
these are the types of transformation photos i like to see god bless
aww he was so timid before and looks very outgoing now great job pet owners
thanks for turning my heart into goddamn liquid such a heckin cute pupper
i see you played blue eyes cute puppy in charm mode
those anime eyes are so beautiful they honestly look fake
oh come on i have no words for this kind of cuteness overload
that s green not blue you might want to get your eyes checked for color blindness
there‚Äôs a dog out there somewhere that takes better photos than the general population he is the best of bois
cool a bit big for the dog to have on it s chest but still cool
i d love to do this to my cat but know the only photos i would get is when my year old is running towards her and that s not her being happy lol
huh that was worth looking at interesting and oddly adorable
this is super adorable he is like oh pigeon oh eggs oh sandles
i love the idea amp x b but given that it is done by nikon most probably its fake
this is a fucking genius idea i don t care if some say it s fake
they missed out one picture of a car where in the reflection you can see a guy holding the dog and taking the picture
if i strapped a camera on my lab s chest there would be a full roll of photos of mangoes and newspapers
you guys in the comments are special bitch the last one was of the dog with the camera r whooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooosh
its cool for the owner but totally irrelevant for the dog
i call shenanigans dog would never get this close to cats who would stare at him so chill
lol every photo in focus and well composed with a lot of the pictures with the rule of thirds damn xd
super fake and wouldn t work in reality wish it were true cause it s a cute idea
this dog gets excited about everything mushrooms and eggs included
i feel like this is fake no dog will be that steady to take photos that good
‚Äúhe can take a photo of what excites him ‚Äù you mean everything or it‚Äôll be photos of him humping other dogs lol
there was a decent sized fire in the town i grew up in up the mountain it was absolutely wild the amount of animals that came running down the mountain into the town deer elk a bear tons of rabbits even a mountain lion
you can almost see compassion fighting his survival instinct to run away i m glad compassion won humanity deserves to be saved
reminder when this was first posted op the actual original poster said the guy declined an interview and didn t want to be on camera
and when this came out everyone made fun of him for being white
is it bad my immediate thought was cooked rabbit from minecraft
that‚Äôs how everybody should react to any animal dying for the wrong reasons
this is the kind of love i want to see on the front page every day
you can see his fear and despair and still he stays and helps the little bun that needed some help real life hero for me
he‚Äôs a keeper i wanna contribute to his balls of steel
that bunny probably would have run out into the open soon had there not been some giant screaming monster running back and forth blocking his escape
the worst in the world shows the best in humans was always like that and will always be
props to him i definitely would‚Äôve just kept driving
my heart still hurts because someone hit one of my neighborhood bunnies with their car it s blood was bespilt on a road with max speed limit of mph someone intentionally hit my bunny
the dedication in that guy is admirable more people like him in the world please
i hope this man knows that he is an absolute angel and i love him for doing this what a good human
this one act is how i wish the whole world could be naive i know but wouldn‚Äôt it be great if all were this selfless thank you kind sir for saving that bunny
what was he doing beforehand just trying to get the rabbit s attention
as somone who owns bunnies i can say catching one once they re out and running is a task bless this man that little bun was probably terrified
this is so sweet you can see how nervous he is but he still grabs the bun bun and holds him close to protect him from the flames very wholesome and a good bloke
the hero we need but don t deserve hes a good person
if he‚Äôd waited more minutes it would‚Äôve finished cooking
catching a bunny is no joke especially a scared and wild one what a good guy
i just love how much he cares you can see it in his body language
i remember this day it was raining ash in my backyard good california memories
that is one good dude showing bravery while staring danger right in the eyes despite being rightly scared he stood his ground and saved that animal fucking awesome
what a brave young man for his bravery for saving another life thank you for saving the precious bunny
this give me hope the news and politicians make us think the world sucks but if someone is willing to save a bunny
so this is actually a video of a notorious bunny thief from the who can‚Äôt contain his excitement at a new addition to his collection smh
now reverse it to see him put that bunny in the fire
too bad we don t care for all animals like this or we d all be vegan
is this how people decide to have rabbits as pets i think this is how people get rabbits as pets amazing heart many of us could learn to respond so genuinely
whenever i start to lose faith in humanity i see something like this video and it keeps that tiny flame pun unintended of faith alive
at first this looks like that oh there s a rat video lol
wherever this guy is i hope life is treating him well and he is happy it s not easy to do something so selfless
after this went viral years ago experts said that this rescue probably doomed the bunny s litter of babies wild animals know how to deal with wildfires and if they aren t running away its for a good reason they are trying to save their young experts adviced that the best thing to do is let them be
in case anyone is confused with the repost california is not burning right now we are just flooded
op dude what the fuck why would you run into the fire me bunny
so its that time of year again in california well i better prepare because the fires in portugal are coming as well
seen it before last year‚Äôs wildfires but still will upvote
for the first half i thought he was just trying to imitate a sim
i remember this turned out he stopped the rabbit from trying to save its babies
everytime i see this video it restores my hope in humanity a bit more
that guy has more balls than most men i d like to buy him a drink
rabbits have low stamina and a self freeze attribute that actives whenever they get fear status they also avoid threats which were all around in this case just need to make it bounce between the threats and put it in your inventory when self freeze actives so he unknowingly had the right strat
i wonder if maybe he initially happened upon the rabbit frozen when going by rabbits freeze when scared picked it up and then it unfroze and jumped toward the fire prompting the panic until he could pick it up again
not all heroes wear capes some wears a hoodie and shorts he has his heart at the right place
you know now that the bunny has human scent on it the fire will no longer accept it as kin and could even become aggressive if reintroduced
i just read ‚Äúsaving‚Äù as ‚Äúserving‚Äù as if someone were to eat the damn bunny
the way he holds the bunny so carefully makes me tear up what a wonderful human
dude is a hero some people may make fun of him but he did a good thing and saved a life
after he finishes the photo the kitten bites his ear hard and he just starts screaming you goddamn little fucker i knew this was a mistake
am i the only one seeing this man trying to steal alvin and the chipmunks
scrolling through reddit and see pic i posted two years ago i m back baby
you should have gone to a pet store or something and taken a picture of a similar but clearly distinct kitten so they think you lost the cat and tried to hastily replace it
really thought this was david cross for way too long
this might have been the cutest thing i have ever seen
"ahhhwww ohhh
ouch ouch charlie ouch
hehe charlie bit me"
love the left cat s feeble attempts at admonition turning into pets for the right cat
that little paw shake after the bite was so damn cute
perfect and caused me to look up the original video which made me smile all over again
proof that sticking your paw into a yawning kitten s mouth to assert dominance doesn t always work as planned
you ever wonder if in a few years were going to get a metoo accusation titled charlie fingered my bits
doesn t look like charlie even meant to bite anything just happened to get a whole paw in the mouth mid yawn poor charlie
is it me or are all alpacas smug bastards look at that face he knows exactly whats going on that smug bastard
so many of these positioned at tourist locations pay me to take our picture
i like how the alpaca look so smug like do my deeds and photograph by superiority inferior human beings
gf aww can‚Äôt tell whose cuter the girl or alpaca me alpaca gt gt gt gt gt gt anything else
please dont pay people to take these photos these alpacas and children are not being treated fairly and by paying them you re just propagating a exploitative system source every tour guide in cusco
the amount of money we must have spent because my kids and of course myself couldn t resist petting every baby alpaca we saw softest fluffiest clouds
wait they let you take alpacas on the bus wiiiiiiiild
talk about adorable this picture just scream awwwww
if there are people here who require more alpacas as i do there s a great insta called onlyalpacasdaily it makes me happy
phone rings hello john we have a situation it s the alpacas they re dropping like flies out here we need more fast stay calm hq get me on the earliest flight to peru i know exactly where to look
peru is such a beautiful country please consider doing a post detailing your trip the do‚Äôs don‚Äôts i will be traveling there in the fall and any information would help d
where is this in peru i spent two weeks there in march
can someone give me the reasons why you should not have alpacas at your wedding i need to explain this to my girlfriend
there s more than enough cats around here but i appreciate the big floofer
looks like a mix of perfect bed and perfect hot water bottle to me
that s a really nice looking cat i love when cats have smiling faces like that
adorable orange tabby most of them are males how about that
i had a cat that looked just like this peaches i lost him years ago and you seriously just made him show up on my feed thank you for the memories i forgive for the tears üíõ
i m not trying to be rude but does this photo have a filter that makes it look this way i mean like well saturated with very little darks and if so how to achieve this effect filter i m learning photography
he s beautiful and this picture is absolutely stunning
i don t know why but even if he she is cute i see psychopath s eyes like play with me or i will destroy every single photo you ve just taken with my claws but he she is cute
i swear there s something about orange cats every one i ve ever met has been super social and just wants to be pet
that is the most beautiful picture so vibrant o such a pretty kitty
i just want to smoosh his little face great photography by the way
ok but this is still a top fucking tier photograph holy crap
plays with cat for hours what did i come here for again
this looks like an super detailed video game omg great pic
damn what camera did you use that is an absurd amount of dynamic range it looks really nice
i read the title while scrolling before the picture was scrolled up on the screen and i thought this was going in a much different direction
the place in the back reminds me of the place in the shining where they own an apartment
cats love the sound of the shutter on my camera it‚Äôs like i‚Äôm a kitty whisperer
he s beautiful i m sure he was awesome it ll get easier dude even though it definitely doesn t right now you also have him the best years don t forget that
it does but it‚Äôll be hard for a while that is a beautiful cat and i bet he was the best boy you‚Äôll ever have had the chance to have as part of your family i‚Äôm here if you need to talk
the pain will lose its edge but you‚Äôll never lose it but the same is true of all the good memories every moment good and bad will become softer but never less precious lost my lovely girl izzy after years it‚Äôs been more than a year and sometimes i still tear up but every time i remember her i am filled with a warm glow she brought so much joy it still spills into my life i‚Äôm so sorry for your loss and i hope that the joy sox brought you will continue to color your life
when i lost my girl just under a year ago i wrote a list of all the things i loved about her her quirks and mannerisms just so i can look at it have a bit of a cry and a smile i have this list on my phone just for me the pain dulls one day you can talk about him or her again without choking up and then even laugh at their funny ways their love follows your everywhere
it never gets easier you just learn to cope with the pain
i‚Äôm sorry for your loss cat person years is a good long life he‚Äôs chasing mice now ‚ù§Ô∏è
it does get easier and over time you remember the good times and the love and not the end you can‚Äôt have the joy of sox without the pain of him going to heaven and i bet you wouldn‚Äôt swap those fantastic years for anything sending hugs to you
hold onto the good times so long as you do that sox will always be with you my beloved oscar passed aged at least according to the vet a few years ago even that makes me smile that cat was so stubborn only old age could get him in the end i keep the cushion he used to sit on on my desk thank you for all the good times buddy
it gets easier but it never goes away little things pop out of nowhere and will remind you of him and you‚Äôll choke up or even cry i‚Äôm a yo man and it still happens with two of my dogs one we lost years ago and the other to cancer a few weeks ago
i m so sorry it s so hard to lose an animal friend my heart broke when my kitty girl passed that was nearly years ago i have a cat brush with her fur in it still i can t clean it out i eventually was emotionally ready to get another cat he s amazing in his own way it doesn t go away but it does get easier
aw the onion knight hopefully he doesn‚Äôt actually smell like onions though lol he looks so sweet
you may think you own a cat but the cat really owns you
smart of you to name your cat after him only after the show ended they could have turned him into a mass murderer in the last episode who knows
by whichever gods it s me but in cat form what did the red woman do this time
and occasionally possessed by the crazy wild sillies
the next fitbit update will count arm amp hand scratches
it s not who i m underneath but what i do that defines me
i love how s he s like damn i bet i look pretty heckin cool right now
for a second i though it s gonna tip over but it didnt
it looks like she was forced to slide i see the person from behind the slide pushing her down
pretty clearly a person pushed the dog also this is a reposted repost of a reposted reposted repost
and that i saw last week and the week before that and the week before that
i hate the cheesy music on these videos but i still love the content sound off
i can die now that i‚Äôve seen the cutest thing in existence
looks exactly like pikachu in the pok√©mon detective pikachu movie you can‚Äôt even tell if it‚Äôs a real duck or excellent cgi
you may see it in a kitten or a puppy when they re young a look that has you smitten when their life has just begun this duckling has it in their eyes when looking back at you fragility you realize the innocence of new a life so very small you truly hold it in your hand no strength they have at all the world they cannot understand but how will they perceive this giant human face above will their small heart believe that you are someone they could love
"human ‚Äúhey beautiful‚Äù
duckie ‚Äústaaahhhppp you‚Äôre making me blush‚Äù bats eyelashes"
jesus ever heard of moisturizer that looks like lizard hand
golden retrievers aren‚Äôt the smartest breed but i‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll get consent first
the panicked look at her owner from the little white dog at the five second is priceless
oh this is exactly what we do with our two african greys one goes on the underwear drawer and the other in the sock drawer we say they‚Äôre in the condo as one us up a few levels they‚Äôre so cute
the more i see parrots the less i‚Äôm convinced they‚Äôre not just feathered toddlers
i wonder what‚Äôs wrong with it‚Äôs chest feathers it‚Äôs bare there
corgis can get that big or or are you just really tiny im so confused
i saw this fella on that other social media site and i‚Äôm still impressed by his size gorgeous boy
husband let s have a dog wife no husband at least small one wife fine little did she know i had d c l a w s giant corgi
what breed is your dog corgis don‚Äôt get that big so i‚Äôm assuming he she is a mix breed
that‚Äôs the biggest corgi head i‚Äôve ever seen i love him
thicc ass chonk omg is he a mixed breed or a genetic monster teddy
am i the only one that sees it is a corgi sitting on another dog look for the corgis hind leg it is white and the dog under him is another shade
haha i used to love doing this to strangers they were not impressed by my surprise t rex impression
stopped doing that when my mom left me she kept telling me to get out and i didn t listen so she walked out the store scared me straight
the animal versions of batman and robin from the lego batman movie
yes and if this was in the men‚Äôs section we‚Äôd collect all the pins we‚Äôd find on the floor
i fell asleep down there and my mom spent hours looking for me and freaking out
it was all fun and games until you hear your name over the loud speaker because you became ‚Äúa lost child‚Äù looking back i put my parents through hell
would hire just to have such a handsome kitty around good luck though remember to think positive
you don‚Äôt want the job it‚Äôs a national holiday and they force their people to work
what are your qualifications amp x b cat rolls on it s back amp x b you re hired
it‚Äôd be a cat astrophe if this kitty doesn‚Äôt find employment
i have a feline that you re purrfect for the job i m not kitten you
someone remember the original poster cause this video isn t particularly old and someone steals it every other week at least
looks like a little jack russell a fantastic little breed of dog
great name for a pup san rocco being the patron saint of dogs
i love how dogs make friends with so many people they‚Äôre some of the most social animals
not to sound dramatic or anything but i would die for rocco
anybody seen that film the drop great film great pupper
i m disappointed not to see any klay thompson reference rocco
i feel like i can sorta relate to him dunno why just do
if i ever get pets of my own i would i ll name one rococo coco for short and baroque barry for short
good thing that there s fence otherwise he d rip your ass apart
a neighbor dog can be great all the cute without the work and you pet sitting is optional
jrt alert give him some behind the ear scritches chin tickles chest pets and belly rubs
i m pretty sure rocco would fit through those bars if he wanted
i read it as lost my neighbors puppy and panicked for a few seconds
i think my dog might owe back child support on this puppy
i can t speak for everyone here but i feel like we need no we deserve an album of this precious good boy
looks just like my brother‚Äôs dog he‚Äôs old now but still has energy like a puppy
aww so adorable i have an almost pure breed jack russel and shes the best
that fence will not hold i learned from experience my dog bit a hole through multiple sides of the fence to get to the other side
i once had a doggo named rocco that i actually picked up at a local popeyes chicken because i visited everyday and he was always outside begging for food at the time i already had another female dog named rouge i adopted from my dealer who was an ass and mistreated her kept her locked in the bathroom anyway after a few months rocco and rouge hooked up and had a litter i was very irresponsible at the time and didn‚Äôt get either dog spayed or neutered they had about pups and i only kept one the only boy out of the whole pack because of that we named him ‚Äúmijo‚Äù spanish for ‚Äúmy son‚Äù mijo got huge really fast i mean before he was one he was almost twice the size of his dad rocco he was very protective of his mother too i‚Äôd never seen a dog so protective of another it would get bad to the point we would have to separate mijo and rocco because they would really fight like ripping with their teeth and not letting go i still have flashback and ptsd of grabbing their jaws and getting my hands cut just crying to let each other go because i didn‚Äôt want them to kill each other mijo always won he was twice the size of rocco there were times when i had to take rocco to the vet for stiches due to gashes from his son i was so attached to mijo i couldn‚Äôt get rid of him he was the sweetest dog i had encountered but in seconds he could go to the most viscous if rocco even looked at his mom i was away visiting my dad in a different state when i got a call from my brother who i lived with my worst fear had came true they came home to the door separating our dogs torn off the hinges and almost broken in half mijo killed his dad i‚Äôm glad i wasn‚Äôt there to see it because i don‚Äôt think i would have stopped crying for a year it had already took me months it was my fault i was a horrible pet owner and i should have taken more responsibility today is the year anniversary of when rocco was killed and when i got on reddit this picture made me smile uncontrollably and cry at the same time thanks for the reminder and i know we don‚Äôt know each other at all but i think i see a little bit of my rocco in yours
probably could make at least eight tacos out of that
oh my god those eyes so fucking adorable i m gonna get myself a puppy too and i already love him her with all my heart
oh my god he looks a lot like rocko from rocko s modern life
"m km can i
please accept it co def myugh cough ct can t"
ok but just don t steal him because you think you deserve it
we love our neighbor s dog aptly named pistol the neighbors have about six dogs but pistol is always the one in trouble he dug his way over to our property to play with our dogs i m pretty our chickens like him too as he always attempts to come to their rescue when we disturb them
i had a beagle named rocco that i named after rocko‚Äôs modern life i spelled it like op tho cuz i was he made it almost years and i miss him all the time this pup is adorable though looks for a new dog
fun fact st rocco is the patron saint of dogs source am catholic and my dog‚Äôs name is also rocco
i hate all my neighbors pets all they do is bark cause the owners dont give them attention and discipline enough
love thy neighbour and love thy neighbour s puppy too üêïüê∂
i read this as ‚Äúi lost my neighbors puppy‚Äù and the picture just makes it worse
he could end up getting through the gaps in the fence
he looks exactly like i imagine my pooch did as a puppy i got him when he was about so i never saw him less than fully grown
on a side note rocco reminds me of the dog in the drop a really good movie that went completely under the radar and it has really good acting by tom hardy james gandolfini noomi rapace and tom ortiz
is your neighbor a klay thompson fan his dog is also named rocco
aww those big brown eyes melt my heart ‚ù§Ô∏è give him lots of pets from me
in local news have you seen this puppy authorities say rocco was in the backyard for a normal potty break when nancy and ed called for rocco to return inside the home he was nowhere to be seen i was hollerin his name but he just wouldn t come said ed it is believed that rocco may have been taken possibly by a neighbor but the neighbor has not been seen in hours
soon to be not your neighbor s puppy take that dog now
rocco roccon and rollin down at the street i was strollin
i have a dog that looks exactly like this named rocco
this is a perfect example of me tying to run away from all my problems
if you remain childless this is basically what visiting your friends who have kids is like in your ‚Äôs except you‚Äôre holding a glass of wine and trying to have a nice conversation at the same time
props to that obviously scared gsd keeping it s composure i m not pleased that they just released a gaggle of pups on her like that when she was clearly not comfortable with the situation this could have gotten ugly in an eyeblink
gsd has fur up running with tail a little between the legs nice to know owners think scaring their dog is okay because it s cute what happens when gsd stops running and snaps
please stop posting this being a bad owner is not cool or cute
how does this keep getting reposted and upvoted when it s so irresponsible the german shepherd was very close to attacking the pups or any human who touched it it was so scared and angry very good example of idiot humans
is there a way we can report this i mean it‚Äôs not like this is a small subreddit something has to happen unless it gets reposted
the owner thinks its funny that her gs is absolutely terrified jesus fuck there should be a license for people to be allowed to own a dog
all i could see was the traffic in the background and thinking i was fixing to see a puppy snuff film when the gsd bolted into that traffic
do you think that corgi puppies think they‚Äôre german shepherds and that their legs will grow in
do not do this massively irresponsible we lost our little pug of years a couple weeks ago i cant tell you how many times dumb owners would just let their bigger dog breeds come right up to my senior pound pug then im the jerk that grabs my dog and yells at their poor pooch for just doing what their allowed to do fortunately when my new puppy doberman is all grown up and trained we wont have any more unwanted interactions out on our walks
a horde of wild beasts stalk and chase down an innocent pup
that german shep is obviously looking to it‚Äôs owner to help him how do people expect their dogs to trust and respect them as owners when the don‚Äôt stick up for them if my dog was that uncomfortable it‚Äôs my job to fix the situation so he is comfortable that‚Äôs what being a dog owner is
that poor dog the german shepherd is trying to get away and is behaving so well what the heck is wrong with people
i guess because they are puppies they think this is funny who cares how the adult dog feels i would bet if she was a woman showing discomfort around a bunch of running jumping toddlers they would laugh at her too and say they re just babies
beware the dog is so cute that you will never be able to leave
everytime i see that it s like that joke aside cute dog
it‚Äôs the ankle nippers that are the real menace and are better guard dogs i can hear the lb ball of fluff from next door bark more menacingly when people approach their house than the giant malamute great pyr mix downstairs
this isn t yours op it s been online for a couple of years people should specify when it s not their own pic instead of using the title for the opposite
source lifewithmalamutes in instagram this youngster s name is phil he has a frnd family named niko she s an angel too
its just a sign making sure you dont step on the dog
it seemed like it should be written like this beware of harmless dog
i have a friend and they have a sign like this they have a german shepherd and the only thing she attacks with is begging for cuddles
that face my gods he s adorable and i really want to hug him
more like ‚Äúbe aware of the dog and please give him a pet‚Äù
beware of the dog he will hug you and squeeze you and call you george
because most of the time it s just a warning to the postman there s quite a big amount of them being afraid of dogs
i have a beware of dog sign on my gate it s entirely for liability and counter intruder purposes coco would sell out the whole house for a good scruff scratch then feel just terrible about it later that s why i also have ip cams set up
i know that face that face is a fake welcoming face until your in biting distance
maybe the sign should continue to say ‚Äúbeware of dog he may give you a big kiss ‚Äù what a magnificent looking pooch cheers
love dogs don t ever judge a dog you don t know tho he could be in play mode because you haven t stepped into his territory however as soon as that changes so could he
our dog was like that but if we were not home and you came in our yard he would bite big old teddy bear english sheepdog collie x on mom s side dad was great pyrenese or burnese mountain dog and he was actually named two bear he bit a friend of my dads who came over to borrow the lawn mower when we weren t home despite being told not to by my dad oh your dog know me it ll be fine no no it will not be he is a guard dog when we are out
you shouldn‚Äôt approach dogs you don‚Äôt know this sign may be there for liability but it might be there because they have a very friendly dog that occasionally bites
of there were gaurd dogs at heaven he d be one of them so fluffy aaahh
"well when i was a kid we had one rich family in neighbourhood they had no kids cause they where in our capital belgrade they had dogs and a sign be aware one was oto otto second was valerija valeria oto was a kg monster of siberian husky and very aggressive on first touch valerija was a gentle giant of kg malamute once i somehow managed to fall into their backyard and i was greeted with valerija who hugged me
but after i got up oto rushed and started like barking and jumping on me i was paralysed then valerija stood up front me and barked oto started licking me jumping and just like showing tons of love while valerija was drinking water neighbours got out and saw me in daze they just saw me playing with their monster dawg from that day they gave me keys of their front gate i feel like a god when im typing this"
that‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt want to be responsible if you pet their dog it‚Äôs a liability thing
‚Äúbeware moody traveller this dog will brighten your day and put a skip in your step ‚Äù
many people have these as a just in case my friend has two huskies that are the nicest things on the planet but he has a beware of dog sign amp x b you don t know how a dog might react if a random stranger enters the yard and this sign prevents any lawsuits
careful morty if that dog catches you you‚Äôll be riddled with doggo beeeelch kisses
my malinois makes use of this sign he sure puts on a show but is a total wuss if he needed to jump into action i love that derp
i heard that signs like this can get you sued suggesting you knew that your dog may be vicious i was thinking that signs saying be aware of the dog may be better
n√£o h√° direito que possam fazer isto a qualquer animal
awesome brought a smile to my face puppies are so exuberant
wow did not expect kitty to lie down and show his tummy they must be true friends very trusting
i don t see a dog do you mean your kangaroo gets very excited about your cat
the cat s question mark curly tail is also an invitation to play
my sister‚Äôs orange tabby has survived raising three puppies and is now enduring his fourth he‚Äôs usually covered in dried drool from getting his head gnawed on but he clearly enjoys it and comes back for more even though he‚Äôs about
this is the cutest thing i ve ever seen what the actual hellü§Ø
she‚Äôs beautiful and everything but i don‚Äôt appreciate you making want a kitten i don‚Äôt need this positivity in my life right meow
what a great name she‚Äôs a cutie my pup is named zoey too
you have invited the devil into your house months of climbing screens running across your face in the middle of the night knocking off everything on the counters wanting out a closed door oh no wait wanting back in no i mean wanting out or er in kittens are monsters but i wish i had about of them lucky you congrats btw cat toys on amazon are super cheap and the litter genie best damn invention ever no smell seconds to clean the litter box multiple times a day best bucks you will ever spend so happy for you both
do you know what breed she is part siamese himalayan she is gorgeous
those eyes reminds me of my best friend enjoy every possible minute he‚Äôll have been gone a year next month it‚Äôs still the hardest thing to deal with i‚Äôve never loved an animal like i loved him i miss you lou ugh and now i‚Äôm crying again beautiful kitty
as a fellow zoe i highly approve she s a right cutie and an excellent name
oh dear too cute your enslavement to the kitty is assured
zoe is the most precious thing i have ever seen my parents now want a kitty
wonderful ‚ù§Ô∏è thxfor giving zoe a wonderful loving home she is beautiful
is she a siberian beautiful colors and of course white mittens üò∫
its difficult to see clearly in the picture but it looks like theres something red coming out of her eyes ive been dealing with this specific thing in my own cats lately according to my vet its narrowed down to possible things eye infection cat herpes or cat chlamydia cat herpes is untreatable but the infection and chlamydia mostly just requires eye drops and or antibiotics
we just rescued an year old golden retriever named zoey today what a beauty
too cute i grew up with a siamese named zoe but i swear she was a demon in fur
yea i noticed they aren‚Äôt fully white i‚Äôve seen siberian‚Äôs in that color
very cute i m sure the devil horns will appear be ready she will wake you in the middle of the night at the crack of dawn and when it storms hard she will want cuddles you have been warned
a pretty sweet self owned business kickstarter would be someone that makes plush replicas of peoples cats maybe dogs
fuck thats one of those inhumane designer cats isnt it
it took me at least seconds to realise the cat on the left wasn t an actual cat
it is like he trying to say why doesn t he blink with his blink
had to watch it twice before i realised it was a toy
i just realized the one on the left was a stuffed animal i was confused as doodoo until i watched it about times
i spent too long staring at the left cat wondering when the fuck he was gonna blink
gato magnifico ok seriously what is your deal karen because this is creepy
i think a bright cat actually might understand the humor in this
bamboozle no no bamboozle here kitty is just kinda ok human that s kinda idkwtf but whatever is there food ‚ù§Ô∏è
karen what is this are you trying to replace me karen answer me
the animatronic one is way less real than the stuffed one
st cat who the hell is this nd cat what oh that s gus sup gus
it took me way longer to get this than it should have
can someone please tell me what breed of cat is this one
after every blink the cats eyes got more wall eyed aside from this observation here s another and the cat is flipping adorable
my cat does that upnod nose scrunch at me when she says wassup definitely gray cat was having a chat with mom or dad
i love seeing these rare kitties so much but it makes me want to go and squeeze my orange tabby he may not look remarkable to most people but he s my loyal and snuggly floof
looks like a silver tabby aka the breed they use in of cat product commercials
he will grow up thinking he is a minor god many cats do but this one in particular every person he meets trying their darndest to amuse him and feed him throughout the day people making the hugest deal out of his smallest gesture did you see him blink at me
your friend s silver kitten is snow tiger even a thing
if i ever find one of these at the local animal shelter i m gonna being adopting it so fast
snow tigers are real but that s beside the point tiger have rounded off ears and bigger faces and any unintellectual swine that dares challenge me to this go ahead
ocicat my childhood cat was one and had very similar markings what a cute lil guy
i saw two posts today with this photo did you take it or did someone else get it
mmm weird earlier i saw a post about someone who didn t have reddit and asked their friend to upload this pic not sure if repost but still nice cat
"me extremely allergic to cats amp heretofore cat scoffer atter your friend‚Äôs cat walks over to me
me üëÄ transfixed on beautiful silver cub snow tiger kitten specimen yfc mew me scoops up kitty and rubs üêà all over face despite inability to breathe body morphing into one ginormous hive going into cardiac arrest"
i ve seen this several times before and it hits me right in the feels so hard every single time his reaction is so pure and so moving love just love
these are enchroma glasses i am green red color blind my wife and my siblings all pitched in to buy them for me and surprised me with them they are pricey i didn‚Äôt cry but came damn near it it‚Äôs amazing seeing a world you never thought existed
these always get me you forget how major something is then you see this
it can take up to minute to an hour for the eyes to adjust to the glasses from what i‚Äôve heard they don‚Äôt work the second that you put them on also that‚Äôs really cool that he got those glasses
these glasses don t work for black and white color blindness at all they barely work for common types of color blindness
why do we make that little half flapping motion with our hands right before we cry
exactly the same happened to me this morning i went to the bathroom to check my reddit watched your pic and found my dogs on my bed
this legit looks like an old ex of mine does her name start with a t and last names start w a c
well there are dogs in the bed now what exactly is the problem
how does a bunny play do they chase toys i didn‚Äôt know they did that
he looks like he has that luxurious rex bun fur i m allergic to bunnies but if confronted with a rex bunny or any bunny really who am i kidding i can t resist cuddling it
i thought this was a giant bunny for waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too long
the only time i ever babysat a bunny it hid from me unless i shook his can of dried apricots probably fed him too many snacks but i like to think we bonded
i thought this was a giant rabbit in your living room for a hot second
this makes me so happy to see that you also call them bun buns my boyfriend had never heard anyone call them that and makes fun of me

that was a mistake it s cute don t get me wrong but definitely an error in judgment cause that s gonna be his new favorite chew toy eta also it s metal and bad for his teeth veterinary dentists are not cheap just sayin
my lab puppy did the exact same thing he is now years old and we have no stoppers at home
this content is so old that dog is probably dead by now
his name is ollie his instagram is ollieleethecorgi
jeez that is flippin‚Äô cute thanks for making my day a little cheerier
or of the springy doorstop white caps disappeared until i found them in puppy poop sigh
did this with my cat its a double edge sword we had to remove the springs because every night they would play with them and you can hear it from across the house
i feel safer knowing this guardian is watching over us
i remember when i was we found a dead crow in our backyard and me and my cousins buried it and give it a funeral
thought that said baby cow and was really worried about your eyesight for a second there now i‚Äôm worried about mine cute bird tho
that s because baby crows look like the inspiration behind racist caricature drawings of jews this picture is of a baby corn crake
just as cute as it was yesterday when it was on the front page
this is probably the mpst reposted thing on this sub all the karma bots post it at least once
i keep watching this gif for that ear pop at the end

awwww my cats don‚Äôt get on at all so i‚Äôm slowly breaking them in i hope one day my two boys will be like this
aw i would never leave my bed if i had snuggles like that
it honestly looks like it would be impossible to wake up that cat in the front cat isn‚Äôt getting up until it wants to gotta love it
such perfect little angels until they wake up then back to being demons
i totally envy how cats can just sleep any old time and for any length of time i can t sleep at all without mg of seroquel and i ve been out of it for the past three nights so i haven t slept at all i hate myself
i love cats so much i want to be right there with em haha
when you open a fortune cookie and get not two but three good fortunes
when people start wanting to have baby‚Äôs this is all i think about üòÖ
after the day i had i needed something as pure as this
i‚Äôm becoming such a cat guy i didn‚Äôt ask for the cat life it just creeped up on me
makes me wanna go back to my sister s right now and play with my neice s cat
this is for people who are having a bad day or ones who are having a good day
to people complaining about it being a repost new people join this subreddit all the time and not all of them have seen this before nor will they scroll all the way down to whenever this was posted before i wouldn t have seen this if it wasn t reposted i mean it isn t hurting anyone so why make a big deal out of it
what is this stylish puppers name i bet it‚Äôs spunky but fabulous
this is probably the only sub where that post title isn‚Äôt alarming
and i thought the geese and little geeslin crossing the road was a issue
they re beautiful the little guy is still trying to sort out all his legs
people in the car we d love to help but we also enjoy being alive
we need more wildlife crossings under our roads not just for safety but for genetic diversity
‚Äújust give me a sec need to figure out how these things work ‚Äù
moose are huge omg if that‚Äôs a female how big are males
that mother knows the cars don t dare driving into them
i like the look mom gives don t you fucking laugh they re a couple days old thank you good day
i love the way mama is looking around at all the cars like ‚Äúsorry sorry just give us a moment please and we will be out of your way ‚Äù
the ways baby animals knees bend backwards when they re learning how to walk grosses me out even tho i know it s normal
that is a cute baby she‚Äôs doing her best also i did not realize that moose were that tall
adorable what an amazing opportunity to witness something like that
talking about moose that x astro van is an absolute unit
momma was ready to murder everything present with those ears folded back like that close to on the list of animals thou shall not fuck with
i wonder if those bleps mean the same thing in moose as they do in dog if so it‚Äôs saying thanks for not eating my baby or something to that effect
let s just get this out of the way do doo do dodododo
i‚Äôd love to see a moose in the wild from far far away from the safety of a very large car or super sturdy home
my heart wants to help that little thing but my heart also wants to keep beating amp x b god i love nature
dog in second car interesting nope won t fuck with that
out if interest what noise does a moose make i‚Äôve never heard one always just seem to plod around
it s just great to see the kindness of the drivers actually waiting
it always boggles my mind with how massive moose are
the dog in the second car is so curious looks like it just want to jump out and play
mother s first instinct is to take a few hour old baby across a road yikes shit tier moose
that lil baby is clinging so close to mama how weird it must be to drop out of a dream into an alien world
i smiled as my daughter had her first unassisted steps just minutes ago
is this in heber utah by chance my parents have a cabin up in timberlakes and sent me a video of a mom and baby moose yesterday pretty sure i recognize the tractor on top of the hill
the scenery the majestic animal mother and child relationship and everyone there excited to take a minute and watch this amazing event such a beautiful moment
real question here what purpose does the dingleberry serve underneath that mooses chin
that dog in the nd car is losing their fucking mind
lol the dog in the red pick up truck just staring like wtf is that
that just seems like irresponsible parenting don t send your baby into traffic
why are thwy in a hurry to cross the road just stay put for a day or two
i d be tempted to make a lot of noise by honking and revving maybe lurch towards them and scare the little one so s he grows up to be cautious of roadways and vehicles there is the possibility though of a mom damaging the car and maybe even me or b other motorists not seeing the intent and drama erupts
how is no one mentioning the wd van in the background
kinda wish baby humans could come out doing this instead of trying to kill themselves for the first months
so when a moose sits in a crossing its cute but when my friend and i do it we get punched in the face wow
always crazy to me how most baby animals just get up and start walking within minutes hours or birth meanwhile us human babies need like years to become remotely useful without our parents
really appreciate that the white van still waits even after baby moose has technically passed his her side of the road also the baby laying down at one point like mom i m a day old and you got me walking around past metal dinosaurs what the f ck
me learning to drive a manual after driving automatic my whole life oh look a cross road gotta slow down ups forgot the clutch guess ill stop entirely car shut off
i always wonder what animals think of cars i imagine this mother explaining the gentle giants to her baby as he scrambles that usually the cars are pretty non confrontation explaining that if they see you they‚Äôll let you go freely but never sneak up on them or they could kill you
all mamas love their babies that s why it s cruel to support the dairy industry cows only make milk for their calves who are forcibly separated from them often only hours after birth
oh bless walking is hard when you ve been practicing it for decades at least for some of us being just a few hours old is an excellent excuse to curl up in a blanket and acclimatise to the outside world nevermind crossing busy roads whitch yo mamma
tis the season had a couple day old calf and a young cow in my backyard days ago
little one this is called asphalt why do they call it that mommy because your ass fall d down lol now please get off this word fore you piss these white people off
my instinct tells me to get out and carry the baby moose for her wisdom tells me that s a horrible idea
reddit has given me a true fear of moose probably a good one as before i d have tried to pet on most likely
‚Äúhello yes we need an ambulance my husband has just been consumed by an adult moose‚Äù
this is adorable i love how the drivers waited for momma and baby to be across for them to finally go
i love the dog in the passenger seat of the car in back
heartless travelers look on as single mother and helpless baby struggle to cross road
i ve never seen a baby moose before and now that i have i love them
so the baby mouse is learning to trust humans and that they ll be patient and not run them down let s see how that works out baby mouse
wtf is wrong with this surface mom it s so even and slippery
i like how the poor baby is freaking out then mama bends down and licks him like it s ok calm down take your time and get up
damn that moose momma gave a hateful eye to the van
every moose i ve seen in the wild has been about as coordinated at that baby one saw one running along i a few years ago how it didn t trip over its own legs i ll never know
is this on the road headed north out of fairbanks alaska
looks more like a few minutes old considering she hasnt found her feet yet
thats an elk and not a moose right looks rly small to be a fullgrown female moose also if it was it would have been aggresive towards the cars from my experience
still somehow faster than adult geese crossing the road
imagine being late for class because a baby moose was crossing the road
well cute but that was a panic attack i didn‚Äôt need
damn and i thought my mom was pushy and i a constant rush üòÇ
body language in animals is amazing her ears are back ready to kick someones ass the entire time except for when she turns to look at the babe then they go up like she is saying hey little guy lets keep moving so i dont have to murder the idiot meatbag that comes to help you
one charged at my dog while i was hiking trails in alaska it was my first time seeing a moose and she was a bit taller then me and im i am going back up to moose territory in early september and i am honestly wondering why i didn t just stay in the south for school
is it bad if i want to see more of these with different gundam
that might be adorable but moose are dangerous animals be careful if you are near one
imagine being fresh out of the womb and trying to figure out how to use those long ass legs
i had a baby moose come into our campsite one evening found mama moose nearby she was thankfully chill
i literally said awww out loud and all my coworkers looked up at me
what are you looking at you didn t walk till you were one
‚Äúmom what are those ‚Äù ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry they‚Äôre more afraid of us then we are of them‚Äù
i think this is horrific i m upset that they have to cross a concrete street that soon after giving birth
i know i know shes drunk sorry guys i cant bring her anywhere tag that friend lol
mom moose is like take your time we ve got all day such long legs for a baby
the coolest thing i‚Äôve seen in a longgggggg time god bless everyone baby momma patient people
i‚Äôve had a momma moose and her baby come feet infront of me one time i was terrified
baby moose dodododododo dododododododo dododododododo baby moose
how can a moose warrrk so quickalee after birth but a human beering take so many yeeeeeerrrees is it‚Äôa barance
that s a badass van but the meese are also cute yes i purposefully misspelled moose
my two sons play soccer and their coaches are from england one of the coaches asked the kids what their favorite animals were and one kid said i love moose the coaches had no idea what a moose was no moose in england
it would take a human about a year and a half until they could get across the street as gas as a few hour old moose we suck as babies
go moose go go moose go little late for the memorial cup finals tho
with each baby animal i see i get more and more disappointed in human babies
trying to get your blackout drunk friend home from the bar like
ever drank so much your legs stop communicating with your brain
the dog in the red car is cute tho but where is the one driving that car confused af
makes me wonder why human offspring take so long to walk
the look the mama gives the card at the end ‚Äùyeah mother fuckers you wait my baby is precious and you all know it‚Äù
moose legs just seen so incorrect even later in life
shows how stupid human babies are and how dependent they need to be
love how they make that van look like a toy car lol
everyone thinks about the cute helpless baby but does anyone think of the mother who just gave birth and could use a drink
aw so cute nice for people to wait for them to move
look at those meese moosen mooses it‚Äôs just moose isn‚Äôt it
i missed the st second and thought that it gave birth right in the middle of the road gotte a moment i was like wtf
love the lifted chevrolet express with off road tires gm makes those vans with awd and the sweet ride
imagine if babies could walk hours after being born
i once saw a moose with two babies with it it was impressive to see they were bigger than the mother shown in this and the mother i saw was about twice the size of the one shown
that baby moose is probably about as tall as me just looks small in comparison to momma moose
mooses literally look like something you accidentally create in spore
what is a moose doing on a climate like that o o looks like its thousands of km s south of normal moose inhabitant area
my heart was broken for a short moment as i thought the baby had been hurt on the road thank goodness that it just couldn t figure out those lanky legs for a minute
that look from the mother meant you will goddamn well wait and you will like it
i seen a girl leaving the bar last night walking like that baby moose
that momma at the end looks around like ‚Äúanyone have a problem with this ‚Äù
i wonder if the roads are like the equivalent to an ice skating rink in shoes for the first time to humans
i missed the little dude at first and all i could think was damn i knew moose were big but that s fucking huge for a few hours old
someone call moose cps for child endangerment amp x b very cute baby though lt
that guy in the van has to be thinking you don‚Äôt see that every day
how long does it take a newborn moose and its mother to cross the road however long it takes
why is she even moving it around when it s that young they can t really have predators with that mom towering above it
cute in all but i would be terrified being closed to a dangerous momma üò¨
the baby‚Äôs body movement looks like something out of godzilla or clover field
hey let s wave our arms at a mother protecting her young
and that is just the female somewhere close is the male makes the momma look tiny in camparison
i‚Äôm sorry this is very sweet and something i‚Äôd never forget if i seen it in real life but baby moose look fucking weird no neck weird shaped spines
i m canadian saw two moose on the way back from algonquin last month for the very first time in my life both were just these two massive structures in the road to behold one of the most impressive things i ve ever accidently driven into i m glad we got a couple minutes to wait for them to move off the road so i could just stare
never realized how much a baby moose looks like the cloverfield monster
full disclosure i had no idea what size moose were until last year i thought they were like deer sized and then i randomly stumbled upon a photo showing the scale of their size i swear to god i don t think i stopped wowing for a week still has me in awe
come on goddammit your one hour old for goodness sake embarrassing me in front of all the neighbours wait till your father hears about this
showed this to my wife while ‚Äúa moment like this‚Äù by kelly clarkson was playing in the background by accident it made it just a it‚Äôll bit better
moose turns around to van ‚Äúdid you say something ‚Äù silence next car ‚Äúyou anything ‚Äù again silence moose as it starts walking away ‚Äúthought so ‚Äù
mama mouse is like ‚Äú come on baby this isn‚Äôt a safe place‚Äù very cute
momma moose based on those ears you wanna say somethin
wi n√∏t trei a h√∏liday in sweden this y√´r see the l√∏veli lakes the w√∏nd√´rful teleph√∏ne system and m√§ni interesting furri animals including the majestik m√∏√∏se a m√∏√∏se once bit my sister no realli
i just woke up and i didn t see the baby moose at first and was like fuck that s massive for a baby
in ontario up in algonquin park you get tons of moose on the side of the highway for the salt water in the ditches without fail there is always a shitload of cars piled up to get picture from a distance one time a mommy was crossing with her kid and a group of chinese tourists wanted to run up and like take pictures with the fucking moose i had to do my best to find the international hand gestures for don t you fucking do that you will die luckily everyone was yelling at them enough for them to figure out it
‚Äúpardon me pardon me excuse me just getting used to the new legs ‚Äù
is it just me or it looks like the guy in the white van claps when the baby stands back up
i like how the moose looks around and thinks to herself should i charge them naw i ve got my baby here and uncharacteristicly leaves peacefully
i can no longer see a moose without hearing louis ck screaming oh my good i m a moose
they look so silly don t except they can be so aggressive
mom‚Äôs like ‚Äúah jeez guys sorry about this kids ya know‚Äù
i lived up in maine for many years i cant tell you how much i miss moose
that dog in the red suv is having the time of its life
a mom is always there to give her child that little extra push this is gifted by god to all species
sometimes i wonder what goes in the baby‚Äôs minds of these animals like moose and cows when they‚Äôre born i wonder if its like ‚Äúwhoops i am alice now and aware of my existence also i can walk ‚Äù you know this is crazy
at first i thought the baby moose was hit by a car when it got up i was so relieved
in the beginning the baby be like ‚Äúlegs what are legs i have noodles‚Äù
it‚Äôs not so aww when you know people who have died crashing into one of those jaywalking assholes
yep moose is big there s a reason many fences near roads in moose county are ft tall they hop over anything shorter and do whatever they fuck they want
sad but it makes me a bit sad they have roads to cross
does anyone know if the hyper extension of the right front knee and the fallen fetlocks is normal will it correct as the baby gets older i‚Äôm guessing this calf might have just been dropped and that‚Äôs why but it kind of disturbed me to see the struggles
this reminds me of what it‚Äôs like taking a toddler to the store
hi my names johnny knoxville and this is me stealing a baby moose dies
baby ahhhh maa ma legs wait what am am i an octopus now wait what s an octopus maa come now don t do that you got this one hoof at a time there you go hushed baby maa there s people watching what s is that hold me close maa don t worry bby they won t bother us looks at both cars cause i ll fuck they re day up real good baby oh i got this now i m right behind you these guys are weird wth
use to drive a greyhound bus hit a moose at about kph with the left front corner as it came out of the trees stainless steel frame and skin of the bus crushes the front end back into the door and stairwell the door was bent to shit jammed shut had to evacuate the bus through the side windows
i love how the moose know that no one is dumb enough to hit her haha
my first call as a paramedic was a woman that struck a moose she was in so much shock she had no idea she had severe lacerations across her carotid artery and that he car was completely destroyed to this day i still remember the smell of that car with blood everywhere it s been years
did you see the dog in the passenger seat of the red gmc he is like i want to bark but that thing is too damn big
i have never seen the underside of a sitting frog reminds me of hover cat and its so cute
guys someone help me out what s that subreddit with cats laying on glass tables so you see their under squishiness like this frog
used to have frogs like this all the time but my hoa switched landscaping companies and they sprayed the plants with something that killed them all
windshield frog windshield frog does whatever a windshield frog does
it amazes me that something as magnificent as frogs exist
it looks like it takes no shit no karen the coupon you want to use is expired
i know that‚Äôs just how frogs look but frog looks stoned
my cat zippy sits in that position i call it the zippyloaf cause he looks like a loaf of bread xd
that s way too much disapproval for such a small frog
i know that frog and i know that brick you re in houston
looks like a frog like hovercraft it came down from the sky just to judge me
based off of frog brick color and keystone along with garage door i feel like this was taken in the woodlands
why does this frog s face put me in mind of british actor michael caine
for a second i thought i was looking at a frog being launched by some unseen force through the air
aww where do i need to live to see these cute creatures
hyla cinerea aka american green treefrog common in the south east and gulf coast areas
animals sitting on clear screen should be a thing so cute
doo doo do da doo afro ducky afro ducky dut dut dun nana afro ducky afro ducky
i ve never seen a baby moose thank you for this beautiful blessing
that lifted chevy express must have some bumpy roads to travel for their regular deliveries
looks at us don t even think of it nope just gonna sit here quietly ma am you take your time have a good life kid
every parent ever dont play in the street what did i tell you
i like how momma moose gives the drivers dirty looks likes she‚Äôs blaming them for the road being there and tripping her baby
it distresses me that the pavement might be hot when the baby fell
and if a car had hurt her baby she would have easily totalled it with the driver trapped inside moose are powerful animals especially when provoked
mama moose is a showstopper in the finest sense of the word go baby go
wow lil fellow must only be hours old with how wobbly they are
if you don‚Äôt mind me asking how‚Äôd did he she loose their eye and part of their ear
that‚Äôs awful at least she has a happy life now with lots of love
when i think of a lucky animal i don t picture one that s missing an eye and a piece of its ear but i hope his name gives him confidence
she looks like a real survivor have a great life together
please tell your cat that i would die for them in a heartbeat omg lt
missing an eye is gets extra pets from me missing part of an ear too gets super double extra pets from me give your cat super double extra pets from me üòÉ
ahhh i had a one eyed rescue kitty for a long time sweetest lil girl give your baby lots of snuggles and scritches especially around those adorable bunny ears
you and your friends are in side now just watch around you
we ve been coming to this club for years then suddenly there s no room what do we need to be on a list how d you like a suit by the animal civil liberties union or is that not dressy enough for you
there‚Äôs a glitch in the matrix but not necessarily a bad glitch
the two in the back were looking at the face of the person behind the wall
better ask the real question here who is the goodest of them
the one front and center is such a majestic little specimen
the council had decided your fate ready yourself for many boops shall come
that was my dog s name many years ago i miss teh old guy died probably years ago was also black and white a pomeranian that looked like a skunk
border collie or is he a mix he‚Äôs absolutely adorable
she has the sweetest little face it must be difficult to refuse her anything
boomer looks just like my childhood dog love you boomer
he looks just like a young version of my nephew s dog who just passed away named boomer amazing coincidence i think not
who caused the housing crisis that almost destroyed the economy you did
you re going to look back at this picture in years and wonder what in the hell boomer did to your sofa i have a year old dog who claimed a love seat then completely wrecked it totally worth it and it ain t goin nowhere until she does
keep that brain ticking over or you ll be in for trouble until she settles down in about or so years
aww last year my black and white girl boomer passed away she was also part some sort of collie and also a runner üêæ‚ù§Ô∏è
he looks like he‚Äôs always excited to hear what you have to say
boomer will live for those wondering it s a nostalgia critic reference
boomer is a beauty wishing you both years of love and fun adventures
welcome to owning a collie and good luck tackle their barking early
naming your pup after a left dead zombie type bold move
boomer looks just like our rescue marly we got her from a border collie rescue and thought she was border collie and corgi but after getting her dna tested she‚Äôs american staffordshire terrier chihuahua and border collie maybe her relative
looks exactly like the puppy version of our little girl sly
i found an abandoned puppy at our ranch and her name is boomer because i didn‚Äôt bother to check her undercarriage before starting to call her boomer boomer is a pittie mix but she has a rescue sister who‚Äôs a borgi üòÑ
so cute i love boomer s little white muzzle now to be a bummer my vet advises me to never give my dog actual bones i think she said that jagged pieces can be bad for their digestive track
i had a pet named boomer he was my first pet that wasn‚Äôt a family pet but my own and he passed away this pas october had him for years
ahh little boomer always votes conservative and says the darndest things at family christmas
shut the heck up ok i can t do this to this cute dog
omygoshiloveboomer awesome dog congrats to the both of you
i have a border collie papillon mix named ruby those eyes will melt you every time so be warned lol and their energy is something to envy ruby was a rescue as well amazing puppers congrats on your new addition he s beautiful
i can hear the tippy taps love it when dogs whole body starts wagging
tail wag is not fast enough must introduce the butt wiggle into the control volume to maximize tail velocity only then will the hooman know that the subject is in fact a good doggo
just a detail but i noticed the scratching post and the lack of cat rushing to greet the owner the cat probably expects the human to come to him her
imagine being this good looking in every stage of your life
can we stop for a moment to realize that the only time this cutie is actually smiling is when having a walk
that s exactly what i want to see before going to bed thank you
this would actually make a great picture to go on the wall i wish i had taken a picture at every stage with my dog and kept all the pictures together
all i heard was the caillou theme song when i saw this
i love how his hair gets rebellious by his adolescence only to fall back to a more business friendly look in maturity
it took him eight pictures to figure out that he s supposed to smile for photos but he nailed it
i wanted to do this with my dog but she got stuck in the puppy phase and there s no change in her pictures after months old
give your dog a pat for me tell him he is a good boy
"puppy puppy puppy
puppy puppy puppy
doggo doggo doggo"
he staring adoringly at the cameraman in every single photo
you can see them like waking up out of their dopey sleepy baby haze to the hyper alert need to chase everything teenager
i like the one in the center the most because he s surrounded by more dogs
i want a dog so bad i just can t see how i would find all the time necessary for such a good boi
this reminds me of a youtube channel tik tok channel that i follow called tuckerbudzyn
this is nine different ways my depression went away and i m now having a good day
man it was weird when my brother got his dog i met him at picture then i spent months on the other side of the country for work and came back to him at pic big difference when they lose the puppy snub snout
unlike me the dog is getting happier while growing older
it‚Äôs a shame that they grow this quick in only a few weeks pic should at least take a year
i just got out of an andy warhol exhibit this would fit in perfectly
had to put down my best friend today this sent me into tears hope they live a long life away from sickness
i can not decide what melts my heart quicker a puppy or sugar faced doggy
lawful good lawful good lawful good lawful good lawful good lawful good lawful good lawful good and lawful good
hes not so comfortable in the first pic probably the first day
oh i have one too and god this brings back memories that is really an adorable pupper
til the same dog can have a round or flat head at different times
ugh i m such an idiot i thought every picture was taken every year and got excited for a second to know that golden retrievers look like a puppy half their lives
picture number is a fun time very challenging but so much fun having your little awkward tweenager bumbling around
i like him as a puppy and i like him even more as a young adult
reddit loves dogs and cats probably bc many ppl dont have kids which is fucked up in my opinion
i can almost smell his breath transitioning from sweet heavenly ovary busting puppy breath to the rank smell of adulthood
i will create more accounts just to give a thumbs up for every pic
once i was seven months old had to chase squirrels and my tail all around
i didn t know how much i loved golden retrievers until i was delivering pizza to a guy who has one yesterday normally dogs keep barking and stay defensive until the owners tell them to stand down but this good boy just looks at me and stop barking when i smile at him he even let me pet him when the door was opened
lemme guess u took that pic when he was weeks old and then every week on a wednesday u took another pic u forgot on on of the days and u took it later i am too lazy to look back at which one but it s around the th pic
honestly i think the perfect stage of growth is all of them
i literally finished reading marley and me today and this is gonna make me cry
i recognize this dog from instagram his name is ollie right our ollie
agree dog amp cats have better facial arrangements but i was always peculiar looking my father according to my insane evil mother who enjoyed torturing me told a nurse that i didn t look right i don t know what his verbatim was only how she phrased it she has a vendetta on me from that first day in the hospital this is recounted in „ÅãËªä„ÅÆÊâãÂìÅ„ÄÇi love animals not just because they don t mind what i look like i d love them even if i were pretty
to me the last photo on bottom row on far right is the most photogenic the face is longer more aristocratic more fashionista
did anybody else happy scream when you saw this cutie lt
looks like one of those fake perfect family photos when you buy a new picture frame üíïüêæ
same hair same eyes same toothy smiles must be twins
your hair has a very similar colour to my living room rug gorgeous family photo by the way
damn perfect hair and your perfect dog this disgusts me
this guy is going to ummm slay so much with this pic and knows it
your face feels so familiar to me but i can‚Äôt place you at all and it‚Äôs not tom cruise as i see from your other comment weird feeling i bet there‚Äôs a german word for this anyhoo adorable dog
lol she is this past months she‚Äôs really kicked it up a notch my wife and i frequently say she‚Äôs benjamin buttonwooding
cant wait to grow old with the four legged love of my life
now i‚Äôm sad because i feel like op and his dog are both gonna die soon
that s a wicked photo i can t imagine the moments you two have spent together over the years
i m prematurely grey i look like a qtip i prefer to call it antique blonde
this is like one of those adorably eerie photos where the animal and the owner look oddly similar lt
man that so reminds me of my black lab rescue janey she was such an awesome dog thanks for sharing
you look simultaneously young and old did you dye your hair
for some reason this beautiful doggo reminds me of mike from breaking bad
your girl looks so happy great job as a dog owner what s her name
‚Äúas soon as that camera is off he‚Äôs gonna fuck that little dog‚Äù
your dog is going the best kind of gray the one old age and a seemingly happy life
i just have to say it but you oddly resemble jim moriarty sherlock
looks a lot like my gsp in the face i mean with the gray areas he is now how old is yours
is your name matt by any chance you look like somebody i used to work with back in the day lol
you can pick up some just for men my friend s dad uses it and it works well hell they might even have some just for dogs too some ladies like the george clooney look though
ahhh i love grey doggos my dog is and she has the greyest of snoots this is a lovely picture thank you for sharing
having to slowly watch both of my girls starting to get white in the face it seems like i foumd them only yesterday
what a wholesome photograph happiness beams from this
i know this post is about the adorable doggo but i can‚Äôt help but point out how fine you are
ok this is just a thirst trap this shit belongs in instagram still they are very cute
use this as your dating profile pic and you‚Äôll have a date every night for the rest of your life cuz god damn you‚Äôre cute wtf is with that lemme guess you‚Äôre too cute to be straight üòë
it s not fair for you to be that hot and your dog that cute

you look so much like my brother it s uncanny wait you didn t get a dog you haven t told me about did you fil
apuzzledking has requested to change teams from straight to unsure
people are assholes but then again there s good people like you who saved this guy from a shit life is he border collie we adopted a month old collie a few years back too from a guy who was physically and emotionally abusing him and he s a completely different pup now over the last few months it just took some time to bring him out of his shell and realize that not all humans are going to mistreat him
he is amazingly cute take him to a vet soon though maybe the shits abandoned him for medical reasons
doggo is gonna be like max then what was that gary thing the other assholes kept saying
"i once left my dog tied outside a with my
bike for no more than mins and some random lady was trying to untie her when i came back she tried say that it was perfectly okay for her to take an unattended dog that by neglecting my dog for those mins i had forfeit my right of ownership she was an older lady so all i had to do was get in her personal space and she took off to her car and drove off not saying you did this but if i had come back seconds later and my dog wasn‚Äôt there i would have been destroyed she is also a border collie ‚ô•Ô∏è"
who on earth could treat such a cute boy in such a ruthless way people disgust me sometimes then dogs inspire me other times
okay some context my fiance and i went to the river in a state park on sunday we went across the river to have more space to spread out on the other side we crossed from there was a group of about adults and kids and the puppy we minded our own business until we heard the puppy screeching and being brought into the water he was freaking out and trying to go anywhere but where he was we saw them take him out and tie him to the tree but didn t think anything of it around or p the entire family left packed up all of their things and left i saw the pup still there but figured they might be coming back for him some of our friends crossed back over to leave and max was whining and trying to chew through his lead eventually it turned into about ish and we realized max was still there and still upset we grabbed all our stuff and went across the river one of my friends went up and the only cars there were ours he was untied he immediately went for the water for a drink he was dirty and he had fleas we took him back to our friend who fosters dogs and he got a bath he is being taken to the vet tomorrow but who leaves a week puppy to fend for themselves
hello max welcome to your new home and be ready to experience true love congrats new puppy owners and thank you for being so kind my joseph says awoo awoo üêæ üíï üêæ
omg thank you for helping max he is too precious ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüê∂
oh my goodness the look on his face is like you don t know what i ve seen
you guys are great i love it when i see good people helping good dogos
thank you for saving him thank you for giving him his fur ever home and showing him what true love is happy life max ‚ù§Ô∏è
thank you for rescuing this sweet boy also fuck all humans that treat dogs like throwaway trash that family shouldn‚Äôt be allowed within yards of a new pet
this breaks my heart to hear that someone did this so happy you have brought him into your home ‚ù§Ô∏è
last year hurricane florence blew down a large oak tree in my front yard out here in the country after trimming it down to the root ball i decided to make it into an arbor while cleaning around it to clear out the debris i found rusty chains that had been underground attached to the tree it makes me very sad to think that there were dogs chained to that tree at one time
what kind of lesson are they teaching their kids so glad you saved the baby
this makes me so sad people like you make the world a better place for animals thank you i hope that i can be this sort of person too when i‚Äôm older
i would have done the exact same thing there will always be haters ignore them the condition this dog was in tells you a lot and the fact no one came back says they had no intentions of coming back keep us up to date on how he is doing all he needs is love that he most definitely didn‚Äôt have there
so sad we took him to the vet and he was microchipped he was confiscated immediately but apparently stolen from his mother and siblings they know it wasn t me but we re grateful he was found
beautiful hopefully that area is cool all year round as i think it s cruel when dog owners get huskies malamutes etc in areas that get hot in summer
i like how misha s hair became darker and so did yours
i like how the owners roots came in as well as the dogs
don t compliment the pretty human girl or you ll get downvoted
imagine if dogs would have no back sides and they d just look like the one on the right
dont comfort her you will fuck everything up with shizune
the poor door mat hasn t enjoyed the period between the photos
anyone else trying to see if she‚Äôs married yet in the ‚Äòafter‚Äô photo
pls make tutorial how grow a good boi beginner lvl kthxbai
i‚Äôm not sure if i should be more impressed by the woman carrying a large doggo in her arms like it‚Äôs nothing or impressed that the doggo is managing to sit still either way that is a good pupper
this is so beautiful is it dog or wolf can anybody tell me thank u
ok help me out here in the pic on the left she reminds me of an actress or famous person anyhow and i can t remember who
why does misha colour her hair and why does she repost
such a beautiful and heart warming photo also the comment section is fruitful
these people are such an asset to the united states imo they epitomize the american dream
mom looks pissed because her daughter did gender studies and will soon be back living with mom and dad
farm work is tough but immigrant parents are tougher
they worked hard and can t afford health insurance so their daughter could take on debt she can never repay to get a job that also does not provide health insurance a beautiful story of capitalism in action
aren t strawberry plants like inches tall where are their legs
that s really wholesome but i love how the mom looks like she really doesn t want to be there
god bless her and her family my son was the first in our family to graduate from college i know how proud her parents are
this is amazing i showed it to my immigrant grandparents and they cried thank you for sharing
central americans plant our food grow our food harvest our food cook our food serve our food pick up the trash remains of our food care for our landscapes care for our children they all need to be deported oh wait
the story behind the photo is that her parents were actually very wealthy land owners in mexico who came to the us where they purchased vast amounts of land whilst buying up private ownership in an existing successful fruit farm still great that she graduated but the title tends to make people think she grew up poor or something
sweet now she will be going back to her home nation to improve the lives of her people with the things she learned right right
really am i to believe there was absolutely no government assistance at all c mon folks
poor parents being made to go in to work on their day off
does she have student loans because i bet she does and that means they didn‚Äôt put her through college
i sure hope student loan debt doesn‚Äôt keep her from actually having a ‚Äúbetter life‚Äù like mine did
powerful picture for a variety of reasons kudos for following dreams and all of that minus kudos for implying there s something pitiable or regressed about her parents and their livelihood
i m white american went to college failed now i have no life and no prospects but i m not a republican and shan t be blaming colored people for my problems
too bad half of america hates them because they are both immigrants and not white shit ass country
jokes are fun but this is truly a great aww sacrifices were made so hard you can tell
oh look another graduation photo better upvote it to the front page like a sheep
and that‚Äôs what our veterans fought for everyone‚Äôs right to pursue the american dream so happy for you
parents working so her daughter can get that america dream
i hope she pays them back to improve their lives as well
hope she is not illegal because if not throw them out
this is the most touching and best picture i have seen in years congratulations to all of you
the moms face is like ‚Äúwe couldn‚Äôt have done this at fucking niagara falls or something‚Äù
mom looks pissed like she knows the kid didn‚Äôt go for law or medical
i was in around pinnacles national park this weekend and therefore near gilroy every farm had pickers sorters etc busting ass literally sunup to sundown and those fields are super exposed shade that they re taken advantage of because they re willing to work for peanuts to put food on the table or send their child to college further chips away at any pride i had in this country or even state
because somehow going to school gives you a better life lol nope it really doesn‚Äôt school guarantees nothing
parents look like they‚Äôve seen some shit this picture should be in history books it‚Äôs amazing
and now she is crippled with student loan payments while her parents slowly become too elderly to work
strawberry fields my parents used to do this when we were younger and yes we went too we would spend the day picking strawberries and the amount that we made barely covered all of the snacks we would buy from the shop best damn donuts and soft serve ice cream i have ever had
i feel like the mom doesn‚Äôt know was to do with her hands
and that folks is the essence of the american dream
to me that‚Äôs what the american dream truly looks like people come here with nothing and are able to give their children a better life than they ever had
graduated with a degree in finger painting and k in student debt
i‚Äôm confused by how it looks like strawberries plants but they hit their knee level
san diego state just got my ma from there congratulations
i will never understand the people who don‚Äôt understand that this is the american dream to live somewhere with the opportunity through hard work and dedication to not only make a better life for yourself but to provide opportunity to your children and your children‚Äôs children immigrants don‚Äôt come to this country to be criminals or ‚Äústeal jobs‚Äù they come for the promise of a better life they come because just like every parent everywhere in the world they want their children to have a better life and more opportunities i guarantee that her parents are thinking that all the sacrifices they made and all the hard work were worth it to see their daughter get an education and a chance at a bright future every parent i know thinks the exact same thing
reminds me of my parents both highly educated college professors back home they waited tables and changed elderly peoples diapers and we lived in a room in someone else s house all so i could have a better life weve never took a penny of welfare or used food stamps they re both now successful people and i like to count myself as one too paying multiples above the average tax payer in taxes people like those in that picture and my parents are what makes america great
she is so beautiful tho glad to see my brown brethren make it in this country ‚úäüèæ‚úäüèæ
wholesome‚Ñ¢ news in america is like year old boy finally pays of sister s cancer bill after years of hard labor in the strawberry fields
my parent were tasked with the job of survival and i with self actualization the immigrant generational gap is real what a luxury it is to search for purpose meaning and fulfillment bo ren
agriculture is among the most noble pursuits if not the it s a shame to see ag workers and farmers treated the way they are anyone working in agriculture should easily be living as well as any doctor doctors can t help people on an empty stomach agriculture precedes medical practice in terms of necessity and therefore importance
my god why won‚Äôt the dust stop messing with my eyes
side note parents are both legal immigrants pretty great
so she s illegal then send her back to mexico i m sure they re dying for us educated graduates
she has overcome significant obstacles and i hope she continues to succeed no matter what life throws her way well done
can you please stop putting stuff on animals sure it looks cute but do they really like this
owl i like to report an incident cop giggling do you know hoo dunnit owl sir eight people were murdered
i m just reminded of the still haven t found my berries guy
omg i once dreamed about owning an owl this tiny he lived in a nest built inside a coffee can and would ride in my pockets
owls are either cute or butt ugly there is no in between
hoo does it better when i figure it out owl let y‚Äôall know üòâ don‚Äôt worry i‚Äôll be here all night folks üòÇ

this owl is like way more attractive than a lot of humans i know
i d drop the fucking camera and make sure my dog didnt just suffer a stroke
wait where did the ball come from what magic is this
looks like a sensor fault i think boeing has an update out for that
i feel like they tripped and tried to act like it was intentional at least that s what my cat does when she messes up a jump
would‚Äôve been a lot easier if they used both hands instead of filming
this isn t aww we should be ashamed that this is even a problem
the fish swam deeper into the bag the first time lmao
that s just really fresh individually packed sashimi
i had something similar a little fish was cought in a walmart bag on the bank of a local public lake my daughter found it and made me save it she considered herself an honary octonaut
would have been easier if you just put your virtue signaling device down and used both hands
we need to find a solution for this plastic problem
it s a shame the fish forgot about it seconds later
lil dude just wanted to die even tried to remain in a plastic when stupid cameraman started to shake it what a silly leg having ass land bitch
lol this puppy is such a cutie but im seeing him on reddit for like the millionth time
he s actually suffering from a neurodegenerative disease that makes him pant uncontrollably he hates this and reposts make it worse
this sweet baby would get anything he she wanted hours of play time forget grading papers ‚ù§‚ù§
i swear if i had a dog in my life i think i d be happier than i have ever been
this is stolen and it‚Äôs sad he got away with it lol
i don‚Äôt know this dog but i love this dog with all my heart
this is maisie for more pics of her cuteness the owner has an instagram for her maisieloupup
this repost is forever welcome and i don t care who posts it
the purest thing i‚Äôve seen in a long time thanks ‚ù§Ô∏è
they say dogs don t express emotions using facial muscles and back up their argument with all the scientific studies ok but i refuse to believe it
would you look at that seems i have a heart after all because it just melted
cuteness overload i m getting a reading of cuddle units this sub was only built to handle cu perishes
that picture is so damn old that dog is likely dead by now
am i the only one that thinks he looks like a gecko
she s as cute as her name congrats on the new family member

my cats all have some kind of weird names this kitty reminds me of my cat beans i think beep is a real good name
suzette jasmine periwinkle hyacinth poppy blueberry birdie bettie sunny maybelle
i love her she doesn t have that static cling that so many cats struggle with
aww yours cuddle when you leave the dryer door open that s cute mine just shit in it
you didn‚Äôt even come up with a different title from the many times this is posted here
extremely dangerous to even let your cats think this is ok amp x b many people have lots their cats because they didnt know they were sleeping in the dryer and turned it on amp x b cats should be sisssed at whenever they are near the dryer
at least come up with a unique title of you re going to repost it i don t have a problem with reposts i mean maybe people haven t seen it times as some of us have but it is so lazy to just copy the same title sigh
tnr alleycat org can tell you how to do it from start to finish they also can tell you where around you does feral tnr for low cost or free spayusa org also has resources for them
these things came outta me and won t leave me alone
feral cats are afraid of humans in order that the kittens not be feral you must handle them regularly otherwise they will be wild and unable to be placed in homes the sooner this happens the better it really should happen at to weeks old but you might be able to tame them even now they look like they might be to weeks old this is very important for their future
i feel so bad for so many homeless animals but lovely to know there are us who care for them she a beautiful looking mum and adorable kittens thanks for sharing your kindness
where‚Äôs the dad he needs to be paying child support
a semi feral cat decided she trusted me and had her kittens in my bed amp x b unfortunately i had just undergone surgery and woke up to feel a sticky bloody mess on my right side i thought my stitches had burst but it was four kittens and another coming out amp x b that s when the dogs heard me stirrring and came in to say hello amp x b the cat had been around the dogs a lot but went full ninja with her kittens in potential danger she leaped off the bed and claw raked two of them across the nose unfortunately her fourth kitten wally was still umbilically connected so he took a sharp slam onto the floor and got dragged halfway round the room amp x b sadly as a result he never achieved his full potential
these are stray cats not exactly feral or they wouldn t be any where near you the responsible thing to do is to get them off the street get them fixed and hopefully into loving homes inside a house stray cats are technically an invasive species and have a hugely detrimental effect on local wildlife such as songbirds voles moles wild mice and squirrels
trap neuter release please our community has a free service but i had to look for it
so if you catch the kittens fix them and send them to homes but don t manage to catch the mama to fix her do you think she ll bring her next batch of kittens to the same house or will cats generally then find another place
it‚Äôs kitten season if you want a cat they are waiting for you
"where do you live here in the us there are many feral cat organizations that will supple the traps which is a safe trap that doesn‚Äôt hurt them
the babies if caught early can be socialized and adopted but the mamma cat is probably too old to be adopted so they usually just mark the ear and release her so she can‚Äôt add to the cat population any more"
mama is like they just showed up one day so i m leaving them with you now
congrats on your new cats like everyone else said have the spade or neutered
this little family needs to be taken in and given homes as much as some people like to say cats are fine to live out doors their life expectancy drops significantly in comparison to a nice cozy home
need to get her spade or neutered help control the pet population
let‚Äôs get that mama trapped and fixed and those precious babies socialized contact a local rescue
op she trusts me a wonderful bond between man and animal cat this sucker is giving me free food stupid hairless animal
congratulations you now own six cats fix them all don t let those kittens stay outside if you want birds bunnies or squirrels in your yard source have six indoor cats
if you can grab them do so and turn them in she needs to be neutered as do the kittens the amount of ecological damage they would be inflicting and the suffering they ll go through in their life on the streets makes it the most humane action available
thank you for being a good human she may never let you pet her but you know that you re as close as she will ever get to being loved
i feel this is the definition of a pet cat just a feral cat that lets you live to feed it and clean up its poop
i would open my door and let them start coming in eventually i will have several cats
so this is where the feeder lives she s ok but she may try to cuddle you put up with it kids
no she is using you you should really take all the kittens to the vet or rsap
kinda sketching me out how op is responding to all the comments except the tnr ones you‚Äôre gonna do the right thing here right u free palestine
itt people saying just neuter them head meanwhile last time i neutered a cat it cost me bucks multiply that by yeah op is definitely going to do that s
that s how you end up with days before you know it they re cute though so it s whatever
did she bring you your angel cat wings too bless you
i had something very similar happen the neighborhood cat had kittens in my apartments shared basement she‚Äôs so comfortable letting me hold and pet her kittens even trying to get her own scratches from me i feel so special
where you at if you are in the us i can help you find a shelter with a trap neuter release program so you can get momma fixed and vaccinated and the kittens adopted out
awww i want to cry you‚Äôre such a good person i am very proud of you c if that means anything lol
don t kid yourself thinking you re helping the community of feral cats by feeding them if you re not also getting them spayed and neutered
i had a feral cat at my doorstep one night with tiny newborns i always leave food out for all the strays even though my home assn tells me not to
by feeing them you are adopting them sounds cruel but do never feed a cat unless you are ready to adopt it call an animal shelter instead
few years later those cats will bring their kittens in for you to feed
she doesn‚Äôt trust you you just provide food stop thinking the cat actually gives two fucks about you
my friend has a german shepherd and a golden retriever now i know what they would look like if they crossed they re both dudes though but it doesn t stop them from trying
i bred my sheep to my golden hoping for this but nope four black lab looking types a long haired sheep and three shep looking pups no golden shepards for me eight pups none looked like that but that is cross breeding for you
the best dog i ever had was the same mix he s been gone almost yrs now still miss him best boi ever
u get the protectiveness and the link very a great win d
had a german shepard golden retriever mix best doggo ever
another fucking repost of the same photo from months ago sorry rant is over continue scrolling through reddit
gonna need you to let me know where you live and when your dog is left home alone just gonna barrow it for some pets
cute dog but it‚Äôs not a mix it‚Äôs a german shepherd with a gene mutation let‚Äôs try and upvote new content yeah
imagine a german shepard fucking a golden retriever i dont know y i find this so funny
nice i have the same mix looks a lot more golden then yours like that your guy has ears that stand up
imagine if we did this with humans hey guys look at this congolese italian mix
that is monstrously adorable officer s arrest this man
i have a german shep golden retriever mix she doesn‚Äôt look like this it‚Äôs more of a blend than that pup is
the real question is whether this sweety has the smarts of a shepherd or the common sense of a golden
i have one but he got stuck with the stock gsd coat so he s not quite as fluffy but still a cutie
this has to be one of the most reposted things on reddit
we have a similar mix dog who looks totally different he has dark fur with some light brown and floppy ears
he looks like a really surprised and super fluffy golden
my first time seeing it so thanks for the repost that others are complaining about
so cute and fuzzy we thought that was what we have but now i that i see yours maybe not
im curious is the bark terrifying as a shepherd or just heavy but not terrifying like a golden
looks like a golden colored shepherd i had the same mix but was like a shepherd colored retriever black nose deep browns with floppy ears and feathery floofs all over
hajahsgjanavanakasce vdjandhsbsbscvsjsjsssbb i wannna pet itttttt
i google this picture like once a week every time i think man i wish my dog was smarter and remember how cute he d be if he was also a german shephard
does anyone have a boy german shepherd and a girl golden retriever i can borrow asking for a friend
i‚Äôve seen a cross between a german shepherd and golden retriever and it did not look like this at all
that might just be the cutest combo i have ever seen
guys what should i do it‚Äôs to cute i don‚Äôt think i can take it
this is about the millionth time i ve seen this picture but damn my heart melts every time
i adopted a golden retriever and shepard mix he is the biggest derp üòù
wow this is definitely the first time this has been posted on here come on mods
i have a shepherd golden mix and have met seen many others they dont look like this pretty sure this is just a cream colored shepherd
i m sure that would be the most loyal breed of dog in existence
karma farming as usual i see this was reposted multiple times already d
it s the rare golden shepherd divine one of the borks
beautiful i need a dog like this to be friends with my dog
this is literally in pewdipie‚Äôs bottle flip video wth
prepare yourself to do a lot of giving in to those puppy eyes
some of my dogs have seemed to understand a return head tilt as i don t understand or i m curious
uh oh she he has that head tilt down not doing to bad with those puppy dog eyes cute as a button
look at those ears i hope you are buying large breed puppy chow or the equivalent
when a dog tilts its head is because they are trying to guague vertical sound source there s a smarter every day video about it
ah the love of excu me loooool beautiful pupper congrats üêæ üíï üêæ
i just love the bat ears on german shepherd puppies üòÉ
mate those ears could misdirect cargo planes amp x b what a cutie
wait what do you mean you have to take my temperature
i m wondering how anyone could even set this sweet puppy down for a minute much less for a vet visit üòçüê∂
he needs a couple doses of huggies a couple bellie rubbies and a boop for good measure
i got a bad feeling about this i can feel it down in my plums
does anyone know what breed this is i think i want one
‚Äúwhat do you mean they have to go up there to take my temperature ‚Äù
is it just me or does that dog look photoshopped in
aww the lil face of concern i hope he got all the treats and pets afterwards for being a brave pupper
love how a clear fucking repost gets a fuck load of karma
doctor i have good new and bad news pupper good news first doctor you are very smol pupper and the bad news doctor i can‚Äôt keep you
my dude you‚Äôll be alright the only reason we came here is to make sure that you‚Äôre gonna b alright
holy shit i had to stop and seriously ‚Äúawww‚Äù i‚Äôm male
he looks worried i just want to tell him it ll be okay
oh my god he s so tiny and cute i can t take this i m gonna cry
and his last time too in the original post he was getting euthanized
reminds me of our little bella she was lbs at her first visit
you had the opportunity to say dogtor but you didnt take it
that face that says they just did the poop stick and thermometer tests
what are you doing get him out of there immediately
in my not so medical opinion i diagnose him with smoll
i love that his collar is so big on him it s hanging around his shoulders
this is so unbelievably cute and heartbreaking all at once
omg soooooo cute and he looks so scared poor baby such an adorable little puppy d
aww please make sure to give him many pets after his trip üíï
first time i actually said aww out loud to a post in this sub lol
diagnosis not a goodboy everyone was real sad lot of disappointment in the room
he‚Äôs probably worried that he‚Äôs at a doctors and not a vet
i ve seen this months ago on here i d remember that puppy anywhere
looks like it‚Äôs not this pups first rodeo you can clearly see the pup giving chest compressions
really sorry to hear about your heart but at least you have an adorable baby dog
user name so apropos today my heart exploded as well ‚ù§
this is so fucking crazy i m just tryna not to act awkward while at a party because i m so done with these year olds that are tryna act hard not saying they aren t harder than they are but it s just too much for me not my scene i m here because my boss is hosting and he talked me into coming at work part of it is he need people to come part of it is i m pretty quiet and i think he wants me to venture out more why he took an interest in improving my social life is beyond me who knows i m gonna try my best i guess call it a day and move on to what i need to move on to
i sure how that puppy is alright my heart would explode if i got to kiss a beautiful lady too
now that i‚Äôve watched this about times i think i need to continue on maybe just one more
yeah good job taking it away from its mom so you can feel better
everything ok you should see a doctor about the exploding heart
this is dangerous levels of cuteness my heart also exploded
i just met you and i love you also it s nap time i assume i ll be at your home when i wake up
i would have to take maternity leave from work im male
puppy forehead kisses are a corner stone of any civilized society
hahah i m watching a game of thrones video got sandor clegane a real warrior right when i opened this gif i got hit with away with you dog
bro u need to check out ur heart definitely not normal to have ur heart explode
he looks just like my family dog did as a puppy we lost him in january
this is what my dog would look like if he was still a puppy he s every got the same white mark down the middle of his head amazing
wish i was a puppy and rest my head of those puppies of yours
well it‚Äôs settled you‚Äôll love each other for the rest of your lives ‚ù§Ô∏è
did you adopt him today did you pick him and he‚Äôs coming home with you later we need details
i watched this for about minutes before i realized it was on loop
as long as you don t call it a fur baby i m on board with those paws
my heart just exploded too bc the pup looks so much like my pup when he was tiny üòçüòçüòç
i was like ok cool another cute puppy gif until the tongue came out now i m melting
those dewclaws are about to come back and be a pain in the ass
i don t think you should be allowed to take care of an other creature if your heart has blown up how can you give that adorable creature love now that you have no heart
awww this reminds me of how many dying resented doggos there are but people still buy fresh pups for attention
this is why i cant go just to look i wouldn t be able to leave without that cutie
that puppy has more of a soul than anyone on reddit
cute puppy but your hairstyle really caught my eye i love the long fringe coupled with the shaggy layered sides
super awesome dog glad you adopted him or her whatever fuck you
so cute i love that peanut butter and chocolate coloring
thank you for adopting an older dog they are the best
his eyes he looks like he still can t believe that his former family abandoned him
our brief has a bit of a sad story he was adopted as a puppy and lived with his dad until almost two months ago when his dad died of old age he huddled next to his dad‚Äôs body for days and when they were found he had to be dragged away he spent a few days in a shelter while the next of kin was notified and they rushed to pick him up unfortunately the wife was allergic to him they called a local rescue agency who placed him with us and after a few days we applied to adopt him the first few weeks he was devastated cried a lot wouldn‚Äôt eat searched the apartment we think looking for his dad sob sob now he‚Äôs a happy boy we have another elderly dog our diesel is years old and they love taking naps and going on walks together brief loves to run and i take him on a mile run a few times a week he‚Äôs happy eating snuggling and we love him so much welcome home to our sweet brief
he is stone cold gorgeous congratulations on your new family member
we have an old boy that we adopted after his dad died he was when we adopted him he s now and going strong but yeah those first six months were really hard for him he was very scared and defensive now he s my happy old curmudgeon
how adorable he will make every one around him happy
he is gorgeous with such soulful eyes and he looks so young i could see him in a john wick movie
i m dead serious when i say this he looks a lot like a friend of mine and it creeps me out a little bit or it s just the fact that it s half past in the morning
first of all thank goodness he landed in your care big hugs for taking in an older pupper i feel blessed hearing his story knowing that not only is he a caring dog but he was placed with a caring family not looking but found brief a big awoo awoo from my husky joseph and hugs and kisses from my family to yours üêæ üíï üêæ
what a beautiful loving faithful dog i am sure you will cherish him just as he did his original human companion
good on you for taking a widowed pupper they often long for their old friend if you could obtain a piece of clothing of the former owner it helps a lot to soothe them
if there s anything negative about this from my experience of rescue organizations in my area is that now you re a foster failure and not used again and getting new fosters established can be a difficult task of course this could be different with who you re working with
wishing you the absolute best reminds me of my german shepherd mix he was ridiculously loyal and my best friend
my cat just woke up and ran over to me to see if i was holding another cat

so perfect if u look real fast ur horse looks like a picture in the material lol i could only imagine if you had a blanket down it would like like one of those horse blanket throws lol too cute
anyone remember that cure amazon commercial where the big horses don t want anything to do with the tiny pony
the ideal pet mows the grass fertilizes the grass removes puddles from lawn is cute gives love
how do you potty train a horse they are pretty dim compared to dogs and seem to just take shits as they walk dogs and cats scout out a safe spot and make a ritual out of covering the poop so you can work around that with them what do you do with tiny horses
it s all cute now until he s or she s standing hands tall and wants to sit on the couch while you re watching the game
is his throat sore he appears to be a little hoarse
just look at the size of that it s amazing where did you ever find a couch that large not to mention that throw pillow
this if why my fil had to make a couch out of hay bales
baby baby boy good baby boy who deserves all the loves
keeshonds are wonderful dogs we had one growing up it was ridiculously loyal even for good boy standards
i ve had two keeshond s in my life they are wonderful companions but make sure you brush them often
i ve never owned dogs with a keener sense of hearing
remember some places only allow service dogs and not emotional support
i miss my keesehound she was my best friend as a kid they are such awesome pets
omg thank goodness for people like you thank you for sharing your pupper with us but more thanks for sharing him with another who truly needs the support and attention that only puppers can give wow i‚Äôm crying because truly this is an awesome post and you are an awesome person hello milo hugs from me and sniffs from my husky joseph üêæ üíï üêæ
i had a keeshond i got her in and we had to put her down in she was the best thing in my life i love her more than anything and she was so wonderful they re beautiful dogs in both looks and personality i do them in here so rarely it s always a joy to see one no one i speak to ever knows of the breed
he‚Äôs going to be the best service dog i can tell because he looks it
had a keeshond awhile back super friendly dog and even got to travel the world when i lived in europe apparently keeshonds speak spanish french italian and swiss german and she could ride a motorcycle sitting on the tank probably miles worth of riding in the california foothills it was her favorite great dog i really miss her good luck with yours
emotional support fuck off own a dog because you love it not because you need it for bullshit reasons
emotional support dog just say pet it is way shorter
dr barksworth mrs bone d stroyer admiral adorable helen mirren i don t have a pun for that it s just a good name
how about bridgette it s french amp means strong also bridgette and baylor sounds nice
baylor and bonnie baylor and beatrix baylor and bitsy baylor and bootsy baylor and blondie baylor and bristol i think it s a bad idea to give dogs names with the same sound if they do want another b name make sure it s distinct some others baylor and chloe baylor and roxie baylor and lola baylor and rowena
brandie brittany bianca bella bea bonnie bunny brynn belladonna brianna
thanks for all the suggestions my top choices bristol paisley willow maisie pia storm y reign rayne barkley we like to try and name our animals based on their personality so far she is very sassy and loves to talk
we have two catahoula mixes named bogart and hepburn absolutely amazing dogs
chimera sounds pretty for a girl look up the meaning
understand her name looks like the grill has been busted a time or ten
omg that fur collar looks so soft i wanna cuddle her right now please cuddle her for me lt
you cropped off the people who made the post bruh if you‚Äôre gonna steal give credit
kitty shark do do do do do do do kitty shark do do do do do do do kitty shark do do do do do do do
free upvotes i guess for the op for someone else s pic
it s insane how big lions are compared to people beautifully scary
there s some kind of illusion happening here cuz it looked like he took the head off the male lion there for a second
the first second and a half would be the last thing you saw if he was wild
so adorable this cat is not coming for just food dis no a hole awww
this is an amazing life experience that only a handful of people have felt
credit him properly that s kevin richardson from lionwhisperertv he has tons of footage with dozens of lions and he has a foundation called cup for a cause which receives small donations to help reduce havitat destruction in south africa kev is the absolute best
that‚Äôs kevin richardson with bobcat and gabby his youtube channel is fantastic
speaking for myself a change of pants would have been in order
am i the only guy wondering if this guy had a selfie stick sticking out of his ass with the gopro on it
those claws are terrifying how do they end up not hurting him unintentionally
does the lioness also know him or is she just joining in coz the lion is
i wonder why big kitties do this but little kitties couldn t care less if you existed
you know that lion adores him because he let him push him onto his back that thing could break a lb mans neck with one swipe of his paw
that s the lion whisperer has his own youtube channel about his life with the cats
lion s girlfriend well i guess this guy s cool if you re snuggling
so i wonder if lions will play fight you like cats do my cat basically thinks he is the shit and attacks my hand when i play with him or dare to rub the belly will a lion do that too because that sounds really scary
the first seconds had me jump back going oh god pls no i was expecting something so much worse
correct me if i am wrong but in most situations this is dangerous right
dont forget a hug is just a strangle you dont finish
my eight pound tabby routinely draws blood when trying to lavish affection on me how is this guy not dead
takes a lot of courage to not run screaming when it‚Äôs charging you with happiness hunger must be an awesome connection
this is the guy who is a member of a lion pride and hyena pack i don t recall him raising any of the lions rather he earned their trust just as he did with the hyenas
‚Äúyou‚Äôre smaller than i remember‚Äù that lion probably
what the fuck is the camera attached to some elongated waist gopro
that lion must have some nice things to say the female came for a cuddle too
the lioness is like i don t know what s going on but i guess i ll join too
i straight thought this nibba was gonna get eaten when i saw him pounce
this is great and all but this has been reposted so many times in this sub
it s cute i m touched i want want but at the same time that s fucking terrifying
any animal is safe to be around with and every animal and insect can be very dangerous to a certain extent what separates it being a threat to you or not is the bond between a man woman and that animal
even if i knew it was the lion that i took care of i still wouldn‚Äôt trust it running at me
where are the cameras on this man and how are they attached
if i were him i know the lion would be excited to see me but if that fucker ran to me i d shit my pants more than i can hold in my stomach
they aren t aggressive if you care for them and these sort of bonding things happen the problem is when they paw at you forgetting that you have a measly mm thick on average barrier between you and your very squishy interior or when they do the thing the lioness or maneless lion those happen too did which is forget you re a very weak incredibly light and fragile human being and unintentionally crush you because that s how they show emotion and they don t realize you re a floppy ragdoll compared to the size of one of those absolute mewnits
for those who dont know this is kevin richardson who is also called the lion whisperer dude is amazing all the lions and leopards he shelters on his reserve get a huge area to themselves live with others of their kind and get frequent cuddle from kevin he has a youtube channel where he talks about the struggles african animals go through especially lions check it out to raise awareness also none of these animals are trained to do this they were hand reared as cubs but are still wild animals and would probably murder anyone else so dont try this on safari
till we find our plaaaace on the path unwinding in the cirrrrcleee the circle of liffffffeeeeee thud
what a good boy he needs treats and some scratchies from his papa
it‚Äôs amazing a creature this large and dangerous can be so loving to such a smaller creature
that s cute but i d shit my pants regardless of how long it d have been since seeing the cub i once cared for
this is kevin richardson you guys he has an instagram and really really loves these animals he d also appreciate it if you d support him on his youtube and socials not sure if i can t post his instas or youtube name just look it up
adorable and home girl just wants get in on the loving
uhhhhh that s two lions i now know i could work my way into a pride with confidence and love dont miss me when i m dead or head of a pride
the guy and the lion seems to be of different size but same weight due to his balls of steel
this feels like footage of my mastiff needing real big snugs
i remember when i was a cub and you could‚Äôve easily killed or hurt me thought i‚Äôd repay the kindness with the tables turned that lion
dear god look at the size of those paws i love cats but this is terrifying lmao
guys it‚Äôs to cute i don‚Äôt think i can take it what do i do
how come when you raise a lion it loves you but raise a house cat and its a little bitch
that boi could sooo fucking easily crush him like a stick this may look cute af and it is but that s a full grown male lion bro dont ever forget that humans aren t top of the food chain for our predatory skills that boi will tear you open like a twinkie
it occurred to me that this is the first time i ve seen one of these lion cuddling human videos with sound the panicked panting of the trainer and the incredibly loud breathing of the lion sorta changes my perspective
my cat walks all over my feet while i sit on the toilet stabbing me repeatedly on my toes w her claws now i am picturing the lion and me in an undersized half bathroom and why cant i just shit in peace
i want superhuman strength powers just so i can cuddle with lions
snuggling the first ten seconds i thought the guy was dead meat
and here i sit complai ging about my kg dog sitting on my lab haha
thats kevin richardson he has a sanctuary full of lions hyenas and a few leopards that he hand raised saved them from the horrendous canned hunting industry in south africa he has a youtube channel and an instagram they re both lionwhisperertv
imagine that he thinking it s just like old times and believing his caretaker can handle carrying his lb weight
i like the females reaction oh we love this guy cool let me get in on this
i was just scrolling through reddit and i saw this gif not knowing what sub it was from and i thought someone was being attacked by a lion
amazing if true i want one lol i‚Äôm afraid to ask but ‚Äúhave a what ‚Äù
that s kevin richardson right he s a channel on youtube he s from south africa and he friends with hyenas too i used to follow his channel religiously he s a great dude
i swear every video of a big cat showing excited affection to a human just looks like the cat got of the way through murdering the human before it caught itself ‚Äúrawrkillohwaitnotthisone ‚Äù
imagine he takes a date out without telling them and just goes ‚Äústay in the car‚Äù and walks up to a lion who proceeded to run at him and hug him
even the lion s wife is like this is the human who took care of you as a cub nice guy
hey brian remember that one time you smacked me with a newspaper for peeing in the plant i do
how absolutely wonderful wouldn‚Äôt it be a wonderful experience to have had caring for these majestic animals and then to have the experience of those cuddles
that s a very strong bond those have because of people would be fucking terrified if a full size lion ran up on them like that
i want this in my life more than nearly anything else right now
that looks like kevin richardson he‚Äôs raised dozens of lions the last years he still takes care of a lot of them at his wild life sanctuary looks like a clip from his youtube videos
my dad is an airline pilot and whenever i go on trips with him he always knows at least one person at where we are staying like a genuine friend other pilots sushi masters etc now imagine that but in the wild and with lions and shit and then imagine the first dm you could use on someone when you slide or are on tinder
just imagine one of the most powerful deadly creatures in the world telling you without words how much it loves and remembers your care with its bone crushing jaw full of razor sharp teeth smashing into you for the snuggs this guy is much braver than me
cats are soo affectionate like when house cats love to head butt you or demand to sit on your lap does anyone know why i haven‚Äôt noticed any other wild animals with the same kind of behavior
i love how the lion s wife is just like oh we re not eating this one okay snuggle time
that s not just one of the people who cared for him that s the mf lion whisperer
when the lion wants to snuggle you can kick and scream all you want you re getting snuggled
i never not share this with my husband we love big murder fur balls
that dude is struggling for his life just to lift him and give him a hug
lion ladyfriend comes in like assuuuh duuude lemme get on this
kevin richardson the lion whisperer and black jaguar white tiger foundation both are doing a commendable job you guys should check them out
hey buddy i appreciate it but i m a human and you re a frickin lion please lay off the hugs
i saw this and sent it to my bf and called him to make sure he saw something joyful before bed thank u
bruh i would be running like i‚Äôm in a deja vu compilation if i saw a lion
man he can snap your neck if you re not careful just by snuggling
yeah but a liger is pretty much like my favorite animal
so cute would love to cuddle with a lion except i don t wanna die so thats a no they can smell fear
serious question as cool as i think these videos are what are the chances of the lion either not remembering you or not caring what is the risk of going up to it and doing this after it has been in the wild for a while
lion wrestling one of the people who cared for him as a cub
i like how the other lion just flops downto join them on the ground
the lion is so pumped and force snuggley the human is doing all he can to keep up lol
ilove how the dresser put his hand on the face of the lion to slow its approach then brace for impact and then shift his weight to the side to gently put him down
i believe this guys name is kevin richardson and he has a youtube channel if i remember correctly it‚Äôs called thelionwhisperer
i feel like wild animals are just like big pets they just dont like us bc they think we are assholes which we are in most cases
bro it s the lion whisperer give the dude some credit in your post while your farming karma
jesus i had to change my underwear just watching this those are some big murder mittens
how often does this situation not work out seems like we don‚Äôt see those videos gifs endorse of the day it‚Äôs a fucking wild terrifying beast that could go all primal instinct on you and tear you to shreds
they got the same camera man as the ‚Äúblair witch project ‚Äù
not gonna lie nearly dropped my phone when i scrolled down and saw a lion charge the camera not the best way thing to see before going to sleep
i wonder what the lions think of classifies the man in his head if he thinks at all definitely not as another lion but not prey either
i love how the lioness is just like oh ok my man like him he won‚Äôt die snuggles too
i hate those lenses at least the paw being half the size of the dude s back gives us some sense of scale
omg that s my dog every time i walk outside for two seconds btw i own two anatolian shepherds lol
this is the lion whisperer right freakin love his youtube
ignoring everything else that s utterly adorable and completely terrifying about this video we are definitely ignoring the fact that he straight up wrestled a lion to the floor
oh my god snuggling with lions would be the best last thing to do
that‚Äôs keith richardson from the youtube page the lion whisperer
i ve always been dreaming to have a cub since i was a little
who else thought they were watching a lion attack someone at first
who said that murder kitties cannot be cute sometimes
once a lion gives you a pass with his pride you got some serious bragging rights
lmao i lion can show love for someone and i can‚Äôt even hug my father
the first part made me shit myself until i realised the lion wasn‚Äôt attacking the guy
love how he s trying to hard to both cuddle the lion and keep it s claws from tearing into him by accident
haha smart he wore a long sleeved shirt i ve seen documentaries those paws are sharp even if it s friendly
someone edit this but put some intense music to change the mood
kevin richard the lion whisper check him out on youtube and please subscribe excellent guy and great content plus the animals are amazing üòç
my little fullballs claw the hell out me when they re happy to see me i m guessing hoping big cats don t do that
i love these every time granted i lose maybe a year of my life from the initial panic but i also lose about minutes every time my little black cat desides to play ‚Äú hey dad ‚Äù at the worst times on my heels
that‚Äôs kevin richardson aka the lion whisperer check out his lion conservation work at www lionwhisperer co za he is has an up close and personal relationship with over adult lions and his video uploads are brilliant
is there a sub dedicated to these sort of videos man and fierce nature just snuggling watching man meet his dog is cute but watching a man with his lion that makes my heart pump
viscious beast attacks with everything but the sharp bits
that s kevin who does great work with hyenas and big cats in general the main issue he always highlights is habitat loss and he s strongly against the trophy hunting industry
third person camera activated because lion used instakill attack on him
kevin richardson s relationship with lions is amazing he hard work in conservation and education has so increased our understanding of these predatory animals his respect for these perfect killing machines helps us relate to what drives a lion and how not to react around them nope lions are not cuddle kitties for most of us we could easily become prey not a lions first choice but sometimes we make it so easy for them and he helps us understand this and how to avoid it if possible even he knows one bad move on his part could be his last the love these lions shower him with is equal to the love and respect he feels for them
well now i know how fucked i am if a lion is running toward me
in my place there a case when a tiger accidentally kill her keeper while playing
i don t think he had much choice in those snuggles he was getting them whether he wanted them or not
i would‚Äôve pooped my pants juuust a little bit though
my big tabby does pretty aggressive headbutts when he‚Äôs excited this is crazy though
terrifying and adorable at the same time ‚ù§ even big kitties like cuddles
i m a year old grown ass man and i cried when i saw this what a cute little bun bun üòç
hello babies welcome to earth it s hot in the summer and cold in the winter it s round and wet and crowded on the outside babies you ve got a hundred years here there s only one rule that i know of babies god damn it you ve got to be kind
is that adorable nugget a rabbit or a french bulldog puppy either way it has my heart
at first i thought it was a handful of oreos and i wanted to eat it
my bunny had babies only once is still alive the other didn‚Äôt make it passed weeks üò≠
it‚Äôs a boston terrier i‚Äôve had amp watched the birth of a litter for my nd baby they doc the tails right away that lil baby still had a tail kinda üòçü•∞
i cried because it reminded me of my rabbit who died last year
that was so fluffy and snuggly i damn near lost my good mind welcome little fluffle
i couldn t tell what it was at first in all honesty i wasn t sure if it was a hamster or a rabbit sometimes it looked like a tiny dog pretty sure my eyes are bad
looking at this is causing me to want another bunny now‚ù§Ô∏è
i live on the outskirts of town so there‚Äôs lots of cottontail and jackrabbits in the spring my yard has baby bunnies here and there one night i was in my bedroom getting ready to go out as my husband stepped out for a cigarette when i thought i heard a baby screaming bloody murder i ran for the door with my husband and son yelling and my cat running around inside the house with a screaming crying baby jackrabbit the baby got away and ran under the cabinet under the sink my husband scrambled to get him but he went through a hole so now he‚Äôs behind the dishwasher my husband tried to move the dishwasher but whoever tiled the floor last didn‚Äôt allow room for it he had to take the stove out to see behind the dishwasher which he did only to discover a round hole on the floor leading to the subfloor we left everything like that threw the cat out and went out we came home and went to bed only to wake up to a baby jackrabbit sitting still like a statue in the middle of the kitchen floor my husband walked up slowly and grabbed it then set it loose outside he hopped off like nothing i was so happy he didn‚Äôt die under my floor
this is the cutest thing that s ever existed in the world
feel a bit like alice tumbling out of the rabbit hole
omg i have a brand new kitten that looks a lot like this can i attach pics to reddit
where is the mother this guy should be next to his mom asap
and my heart just stopped from adorableness overload guess i m dead now
the combo of the video and the title seriously made me a little happier to be alive maybe the world isn‚Äôt so horrible after all
what on this god fucking forsaken planet is that cuteness i need that in my life
i want to squish that little guy because he s so damn cute
so cute thanks for posting this lovely video it made my day
my pet bunny lisa died last year and i m still sad i hope that little one has a great life like lisa had
if it s a rabbit the mom is gonna eat it since you touched it üòÇ
its interesting to see him use his sense of smell and touch since his eyes aren t working yet
the way newborns are looking for mom s nipple always strikes me like they were breastfeeding for years its just amazing nature
who else thought that was like oreos before the gif started playing
your cat should model look at that facial structure
funny meeting you here winniethecatanderson queen of all bleps
i have to stop browsing internet just lost my little fury due to wet fip every pic of a black cat makes me depressed
he s imagining the taste of the souls of his enemies
why do cats do that my cat does the same thing sometimes
that mini cat is adorbs also what kind of cact is that in the background
i remember when i got my first dog that ll be the single best friend she ll ever have
she‚Äôs going to have a private conversation with that dog and they are going to agree to be friends for ever
congratulations to the girl for her first dog may they have a great life together
i have a feeling that pup is going to live the good life
i‚Äôve never had dogs actually at least the last two generations of my family hasn‚Äôt had dogs so i‚Äôm actually not sure how it will affect the dynamics in the family but the kids are ecstatic and spend most of their day around the pup
lol everytime i catch myself saying aww i then say damnit because then i realize i am a slave to the feelz
is it bad that i looked for a smiling dog before realizing it s the kid smiling
is that the dennys on rt across from a mcdonalds it really looks like the intersection though i could be so wrong i was there today though if it is that pup is adorable i got to pet a sweet doodle named milo in that plaza today
am i the only one that thought she was wearing a tiara at first glance
is it me or does the extended arm look freakishly long and rubbery related to elastigirl perhaps also cute dog and cute kid i see a beautiful friendship ahead

i d argue baby goats in general are so cute are these babies yours they re absolutely precious
um donkeys anybody else see donkeys cute but not goats
definitely baby goats it annoys me to no end people everywhere call these donkeys i ve seen this picture on several social media platforms and there are always arguments i have raised both and those are pygmy goats
i had my veterinarian spouse look at them she id‚Äôd their hooves specifically cuz they‚Äôre split so goats
didn t expect to see a kid napping on reddit today let alone two
finally a repost that got the species correct for that repost karma
this is the first time i ve seen this repost titled as goats instead of donkeys
ill make sure all kids will slepp soundly in blanket
poor guy doesn t realize he ll be turned into a muslim s fleshlight
they are donkeys i have raised them in my inner city studio
at first i didn t believe you then i opened the image and i saw that you weren t kidding
take pictures of any other sleeping animals and you re fine but you take one picture of some sleeping kids
calm down dad don t steal the show this is wonderful though props to that dude
you can see both girls watching him too he would have given them so much confidence good dad
couldn t he have stood off to the side a little bit i feel like where he s standing is definitely asking to steal the show
sweet dad kids build themselves from stuff like this üòé
oh my gosh how freakin cute dexter would be adorbs haha
he looks like a jonah idk why first thing that popped into my head
looks like the shocked face from the sonic the hedgehog trailer
can you please name him neal he looks like a neal ü•∞
he looks like a ben his name shall be benjie your welcome
thank you for rescuing such a handsome pupper he looks like a cup of warm hot chocolate with whipped cream on top makes me feel all warm and cozy as i‚Äôm sure he makes you and your family feel enjoy your new addition hugs from me and sniffs from my husky joseph üêæ üíï üêæ
how about fluffy fucktard or harry handi cat instead of handicapped those are great names
he looks like a cute little pterodactyl when he opens his mouth wide
you don‚Äôt always need a language to express your feelings
this is a very uncomfortable looking pup whale eye displacement yawns looks like he s looking for a way out not so cute
so we not gonna talk about the fact the guys legs are hairier than the pupper
dudes why did i just yawn at the exact time this puppy did
she s a cutie those eyes tho our dachshund has the same look when she s getting belly rubs belle is a short hair red not too much on brushing but she is the belly rub queen
oh my god she s cute that submission to you because she knows she s too little to do anything about it
what a beautiful puppy looks like a stuffed animal is he really real
imagine your a mouse sauntering along enjoying your day and you happen to glance up and see that from hoomans perspective adorable from mice‚Äôs perspective a terrifying sight to behold
i feel as if i m seeing something i was not meant to see
when you re at a rave and the lsd starts kicking in
he looks like his eyes are gonna fall out and i love it
potato sees everything and i flipping love him her d
never seen a picture of a cat before where i thought ‚Äúyup what else would you name them ‚Äù
this reminds me of the time my friend who s a pharmacist had to fill out a prescription for an epileptic cat who is also called potato
your cat‚Äôs high as fuck right now don‚Äôt tell the cops cute cat
he s got one eye looking at ya and the other one looking for ya
it is looking into the past and future at the same time
this photo and the fact he s named potato made me bust out laughing love it
what horrors has that cat witnessed has it stared into the face of god and found itself wanting
potato has seen some things man he has seen some things
owner on phone and after that you peel the potato gently and cut it in half
i have a dog named nora who‚Äôs about equally as walleyed she‚Äôs always done this sucking type thing with her mouth when she‚Äôs overstimulated or upset we think it‚Äôs a coping mechanism because she has really bad anxiety and we call it ‚Äúgoldfishing‚Äù when she does it lol reminds me a lot of potato
did the teacher call on him while he was talking during class or something
i hope it s neutered world doesn t need a cat version of pugs
can we not lie to ourselves and say that this thing isn‚Äôt that adorable it‚Äôs more on the meh side if anything
looks like these weird annoying bird things from the last jedi
when i was in ireland i saw a book called the social and economical history of the potato always wanted to use it as you know the book on the bookshelf that triggers the mechanism that opens the secret door and all that but just a picture of potato the cat on that potato book might be just as funny stay cute potato cat
she s the slimed down version of that fat cat laying on the ground looking at the camera can t get the picture of it though
i understand the name potato because it he looks like a vegetable
this caught me so off guard i actually audibly laughed
i ll take it from here thanks mike well you see if you just put the bird feeder on the ground the birds love you more
we must give him name and write it right below where it says my name is
whenever i couldn t find any workers to ask at home depot i was always sure they were squirreled away in the back
if only the staff at my local home depot were that bright and well groomed
you‚Äôre a great person i‚Äôm sure arthur is happy to have found you ‚ù§Ô∏è
far from what you‚Äôve done but i adopted my first adult cat yrs when i went in looking for a kitten it‚Äôs been an great yrs and big hanky is the most loyal and cuddly cat i‚Äôve ever owned yay adults
totally agree amp x b that said amp x b are we still doing phrasing
i have a year old fospice basically she is a permanent foster appearently she had been there for months before i got her people missed out because she is one of the most loving and active cats i have owned and she sticks to me like glue and other than some thyroid issues she is relatively healthy i m glad to see there are other people who are seeing the greatness that silver faces can offer
this is such an excellent idea and i can‚Äôt wait to do it
got my senior foster fail in january she was supposed to be hospice but she s still very much alive she s challenging can t control her bowels needs a lot of meds and has a lot of behavioral issues but boy do i love her she s as cuddly as they get and the longer she s been around the more she realizes how nice her new life is the more the behavior smooths out i just wish she could properly poop in the litter box but we puppy padded up all her sleeping spots i m happy when others take in elderly cats it s so good to give them a final happy living scenario even if it s for a week or several years
i foster adult cats too including seniors i love doing it and the chaos factor is much lower than foster kittens
people like you are angels on earth senior cats are so frequently overlooked i don‚Äôt have the emotional fortitude to do what you do
my last cat and current cat have been seniors last one was but had health issues all his life he only lasted a year with me but was the best cat really affectionate and really chill my new one is and amazing already he doesn t have any health problems but still moves like a kitten he is affectionate and playful
this makes so much sense i love my cats which i got as kittens but this is on my list of life goals for the future
tough part for me is that i can never foster once an animal is in my house more than a week it s family
everyone should consider adopting older kittens as well i ve fostered over a dozen cats over the last years and it feels like a race against the cuteness clock every time when i heard the next kitten i was getting was months old my heart sank he s currently months old and it s depressing how many people have passed him in favor of younger kittens with cats of any age over a few months you get a much better sense of their personalities you have no idea what you re getting with a small kitten
he¬¥s so lucky thank you thank you thank you and they are great companion for a younger cat if you have one
arthur gonna live another years just to spite your claims on his longevity
aww this makes me happy to see i wish i could foster older animals but we have dogs and cats so my so won‚Äôt allow it hah good for you‚ù§Ô∏è
there colouring is so nice and they look so cute what kind of chicks are they i don t think i ever saw that breed before
chickens are cute but i disagree with your username op
when i was a boy we would place seeds in our foreskins and compete to see who could keep the chickens out the longest we were forced to stop when abu sayid passed away ÿßŸéÿ≥Ÿíÿ™Ÿéÿ∫ŸíŸÅŸêÿ±Ÿè ÿßŸÑŸÑ€ÅŸé ÿ±Ÿéÿ®ŸëŸê€å ŸÖŸêŸÜŸí ⁄©ŸèŸÑŸëŸê ÿ≤ŸéŸÜŸíÿ®Ÿç ŸàŸëŸé ÿßŸéÿ™ŸèŸàŸíÿ®Ÿè ÿßŸêŸÑŸé€åŸí€ÅŸê

closest to pets they are pets any animal counts as a pet of you form a bond with it
they are very beautiful i have never seen chickens with that color mix very pretty all birds and animals are so wonderful much better than humans
chickens are cool both on and off the dinner table they ve become a fairly popular off the beaten track pet here in the states
those are beautiful chickens i agree with other posters that you should give the standing chicken a name as well
do they have little leashes on them will they wonder off
do you have one with sound the soft clucking of the chicken coop was always so calming for me but i haven‚Äôt had chickens in years
i told i can have chickens or one goat where i live

nah western chickens barely have any feathers and are covered in scab and have aids n shit because of holding chickens per square meter
chickens are totally pets my sister has a coop of them and my nieces love them as much as they love the dogs and cats
very pretty i see why you love them my family used to raise a few dozen chickens for eggs and meat too many to bond with any individually but they were so funny and cute to watch would take them inside if one gt sick or hurt to heal would get so upset if they didn t make it i live in the city now but can get three once i buy a house totally planning on it thanks for sharing your chickens

before my mom had to escape her home country from a war as a child she had a pet hen that walked around their house like a cat or dog and she had been upset to leave her hen pet behind she told me right before they had to go she took one last look at her hen who was hiding under a table and the hen looked back at her like she knew they would never see each other again a pet is a pet regardless
i sat on the bus next to someone who had chickens as pets he said they make good pets your birds are very pretty
they re beautiful and i know a lot of people who have chickens as pets i bet they love you right back
i had pet chickens growing up they were all adorable although my two favourites were silva a hen with a dodgy foot that was the only survivor of her brood nuggets was my other favourite a rooster that hatched on my birthday and i hand reared didn t introduce him to the other chickens until he was a bit older as a chick he would follow me everywhere magnificent glossy bastard he was when i had an outside room he d always be waiting at the door for me in the morning do the food scratch climb up for scratches i lost most my flock to a breakout of cholera sadly i curse the day we moved to that particular town not a single chicken made it out stray cats cholera old age
congratz friend those chickens are definitely pets and some of the best pets you can have
these chicks will give hard on to many pakistanis xd
chickens can be legit pets had a banty hen named bebe she was skittish about being picked up but once you had her she just loved attention i would put her in my jacket and she d just snuggle and nap anytime i scratched her head or tiny waddle she d make the cutest cooing noise in pure bliss she was almost like the matriarch of the flock any abandoned eggs or chicks were now her s very protective of them but i was special enough to her that she would almost show off the babies to me like any proud mom so much snuggles
when i was a kid we always had farm like homes big backyards and a few chickens and vegetables and fruits plants etc i remember the first time when we started raising chickens mom brought a box with little chickens and there was this one that was all yellow like all of them but had this little dark brown spot on one side i took it for me we used to sit under a grape formation we had just outside the house and have our evening snacks or whatever and i always fed the little chicken and it grew and it came to the window of our room me and my brother s and i kept feeding it and turned out to be a chicken and one day i woke up from a nap and saw her laying an egg on my bed and i called mom to tell her and she laughed and told me we have to make a fence and give them chickens their space or we ll have them all chickens laying eggs everywhere and that s when we gave them their space with their little houses to lay eggs and that was the end of my special chicken coming to eat on my lap at evenings
you should name the second one reddit also they re adorable
you could call one butter chicken or ghee for short
you should name your brother s unnamed chicken aloo poori to match their friend masala chaat d
don‚Äôt ever think less of your adorable pet dinosaurs
isn t it very sad to think of them animals have to die for a measly portion of wings
resolution is great we don t need chickens in k or do we
chickens can make the sweetest pets and pets they are and they do things u can eat
i remember when i was a kid in turkey my parents bought a couple baby chicken i fed them everyday and they followed me everywhere i went i loved them
i love chickens my friend with pet chickens always sends me pictures because they are so cuddly
the factory chickens in america look disgusting this is how a chicken is supposed to look and they re pretty birds

my brother has three chickens and they re currently staying at my place they re pleasant quiet animals who are content to walk around eating grass all day but goddamn are they stupid animals place a small obstacle in front of them and it ll take five minutes before they work out how to walk around it

i m allergic to anything with dander so i have chickens as pets last week one of my girls got attacked by a dog and i ve done everything i could to save her right now she s curled up in the daybed in the library sound asleep since she has chosen not to sleep in the crate with the heat lamp above it she ll be indoors with me until her wounds are healed just like you d do with any other pet love her to bits
i have chickens and they are my pets they are actually very sweet and have awesome little personalities they are beautiful
animals is animals and these chickens deserve all the love they get from you just as much as my cat deserves all the love i try to give her
chickens can certainly be wonderful loving pets give them lots of love from me please
man i d love to have some chickens and a goat and maybe a pig but chickens for sure i currently live in a city center where you re not allowed to have feathered livestock and probably not other livestock but i only inquired about chickens i d love some chickens because fresh eggs and i d have a use for my food scraps you know that little bit of leftover rice or pasta or veggies that just isn t worth saving because you wont eat it anyway feed it to the feathered friends i ve decided that the next time i move i m moving out of the city to get some chickens and a shed to work on my motorbikes
beautiful chickens my aunt raises chickens and roosters for plumage as a hobby they are let‚Äôs have you noticed the difference between your chickens and the farm raised ones that are super fat with oversized breast the natural chickens taste wayyyyy better
the closest you ve ever had to pets those are pets my friend enjoy their company and companionship
i always tell people if it wasnt for the fact it crows roosters would be a very common and see pet to take care of hens are awesome too but roosters really take to their caregivers and show alot of personality
it never ceases to amaze how affectionate animals can be especially the ones who you d never think even have the capacity to behave that way one day in the future we re going to find that all terrestrial creatures are far more sentient than we ever thought possible and we re going to look like monsters worse than we already do
awww they re beautiful i have eleven and i love them
my daughter wants a pet chicken we live in the suburbs in america pretty sure this won t fly with the neighbors
your chickens are much more beautiful than american chickens
a beloved pet who also delivers food is about as good as it gets
i have a couple of friends who swear that chickens are just as intuitive affectionate and loyal as dogs
it‚Äôs really rare to get a good picture of a black pet it‚Äôs really hard to do this pic is amazing
very good photo black is difficult to capture and to have detail in the black is tough good job
i find it so hard to get great pics of my black lab lucy it‚Äôs all about a ton of natural light absolutely gorgeous photo of a gorgeous girl
i do miss our black lab she was such a sweetheart hell i miss all the pooches i ve had over the years
your dog is growing flowers on her head you should go get that checked out
all breeds are beautiful but black labs have my heart lt
where i live the canada goose goslings are just starting to hatch the biggest ones are much smaller than your little fellas
then again their relatives died in the great emu war
canada geese if were lucky lightning struck them probably not that lucky
they have done this every year for the past years even though that doesn t make sense god i need to get off reddit
where did it rain send some to florida inches since may
if you got a problem with canadian geese you got a problem with me and i suggest you let that one marinate
you guys wanna go to red lobster not the slobster again let s keep going
appears to be a late victoria day parade canadian s may holiday was a week ago
i don t understand why i thought they were tiny ostriches at first
that s nicer and bigger than my town s memorial day parade
fuck those canadian geese assholes they re some of the meanest invasive pricks to ever move into an area
wow it is looking like as if they are actually doing parade nice video
ahh yes it s canada s national asshole of the sky and its little turdlings
that s not a parade you fool it s a canadian invasion
looking like a field trip ‚Äúeveryone stay together‚Äù neckass
that s neat only thing i see in a line like that are ants on my table trying to get to some crumbs
looks like a military formation with the drill sergeant commanding its troops into battle
they re patrolling the area as a military exercise don t underestimate the power of the geese they re the second most powerful military force in the world second only to the emus
cnn and msnbc nazi s take to marching the streets in the rain on memorial day
very well organized by each group leader chinese tourist ducks
totally off topic but that s some really nice video hdr what phone was it taken on
taking a walk with your squad is a nice thing even in rainy weather
canadian geese don t parade that s a flash mob of these violent assholes
a remembrance of those who ran into military planes s
you can t have a memorial day parade with frickin canadians eh
cameraman takes one step outside geese gives an evil stare cameraman slowly goes back into the store
if you got a problem with canada gooses then you got a problem with me and i suggest you let that one marinate
they probably just smashed some garlic bay biscuits at that red lobster
oh it was memorial day yesterday was wondering why the onion didn t get updated
update thinking she‚Äôs a girl but not entirely certain
cali for a girl mot short for mottled for boy if you re not entirely sure there are a lot of names like sam alex taylor etc that work well for either sex tootsie would be really funny if it did turn out to be a male cat
your cat is super cute and i‚Äôm not a cat person he‚Äôs freaking adorable i just want to snuggle him just sayin i‚Äôm a total dog person and he makes me want a cat
well he s obviously a great cook i d support his new career although without thumbs you may just have to hit the spacebar for him
haha i love the one where he‚Äôs meowing at the zucchini spirals
terrifying things but also cute in baby form from far away
does taking a shit under water help with propulsion
so hippos can t swim but elephants can mother nature is weird
they move so fast under the water it is ridiculous they run across the bottom like a fucking speed boat
i m working on a mom joke here but give me time i m slower than most
i love how we get to see a close up of it taking a sloppy dump in the water nature
i ll bet that buoyancy in the water feels awesome on their knee joints
just a mom teaching their child how to live so simple yet the most beautiful thing ever
hate to be a downer but now i m wondering how many hippos drown each year
this made me wander how long hippos can hold their breath minutes for the information of those who are interested as well
do hippos and marine mammals share a common ancestor hmmm
does that mean if i drop my hippo in a really deep pool it ll just sink and drown aw shit ill be back real quick
i waited so long for this gif that i thought someone was fucking with me and o ly the swirl was animated
i would like an hour of this footage to run on my living room tv when company comes over
how many of you were worried about the cute little guy drowning cuz i was
who‚Äôs the person with the bowling ball sized balls filming this
waiting for someone to mention their shit tail propeller fights
my teacher s friend was almost eaten by a hippo his leg was nearly torn off
so can you escape from hippos by swimming into deep water
this is incredible before the internet we wouldn‚Äôt have dreamed of seeing things like this but now we see a picture of a black hole baby hippos the rarest species ever caught on film etc we live in an amazing age
the video of it going after the boar made it seem fast
big bones yeah right i know a chonker when i see one
all i can think about is jack black being eaten by one of these guys
so this may sound dumb but how long can they hold their breaths for i see the mother hippo nudging her little one along teaching it have some baby hippos drowned if the mothers can‚Äôt get them to resurface soon enough
i want a permanant baby hippo look at those cute fat lil legs
assasin s creed origins lied to me those are hippos right those suckers dive and chase no bouncing needed
so a hippo then can apparently jump strong enough to clear feet of water from the bottom of the nile river to breach the surface and almost capsize a boat not so sure this theory is correct
good to know that that gif going around of a hippo chasing a boat going mph is fake then
it seems they running in space in zero gravity on the moon
i was chased by a hippo while in a small boat and it was the most terrifying things i‚Äôve ever experienced they are great swimmers type in ‚Äúhippo chasing boat‚Äù to youtube or google and you‚Äôll see how fast they swim it‚Äôs insane
i think i remember reading that whales evolved from hippo like land mammals natural selection is fucking wild
momma hippo had some honey bunches of oats flying out of her
that must be scary as a tiny hippo i wonder how many baby hippos that do not survive their first deepdive
mommy said do the thing you listen to the mommy and you do yes bouncybops dis way aaaand bouncybops good baby
let me re title this post hippos can hold their breath really well
here we can see an adult and an even better a baby chumby
at least they have gills so they can breath under water s
while dolphins are mammal submarines hippos are literally underwater tanks
oh man there is no way that thing is cool with being able to see humans while teaching it‚Äôs kid to swim or at all really hope this isn‚Äôt a skeevy zoo
i feel like this is also the case with pitbulls ever see one swim
please tell me that it legitimately made it above water this ended too soon
la dada dada da da da da la dada dada da da da da la dada dada da da da da la dada dadaaaa dada daaaa dadaaaa dada dada da
can t swim tell that to the hippo in that vid where he is charging at a boat going mph
so the murder beasts can‚Äôt swim despite water being their domain and people say australia has the most dangerous wildlife
how long can hippos hold their breath i m a bit concerned of the baby
when they go walk on the ground after bouncing like kangaroos they must be like damn i m fat
its honestly terrifying to think that i live in afrika south africa to be exact most of these big animals scare the heck out of me
does this mean they would sink amp essentially drown in the ocean
then how do they stay at the surface for seemingly minutes st a time
that mama hippo is me pushing my best friend to ask that guy out
hmm looks like me we both can t swim so we bounce around
did you know that hippos are born under water they have to fight for their life the first few seconds to get out of the water
why does this remind me of people in space stations
tbh it s much more metal that they seem to totally disregard water as a medium and just sort of exist in it
interesting hippo fact hippos can sleep under water and they have an instinctive reflex where they ll bob up to the surface take a breath and sink back down all without waking up
aww look at that thats gotta be the cutest little merciless killing machine ive ever seen
if i were an animal i‚Äôd be a hippo not that i‚Äôm huge but i can‚Äôt swim so i do this
they can definitely swim what kind of bullshit is this
‚Äòyou have big bones that are too dense and heavy‚Äô my mom when i was younger
as cool and interesting as this was to me it made me anxious as fuck i just imagined a hippo falling into a deep pit bouncing away at the bottom as it slowly drowns from its majestic size fucking hell lol
so does this mean that if they fail to bounce up to the surface they might drown just because hey decided to go under water a bit
okay so that scene from madagascar when gloria swimming around in her tank was a fuckin lie gt
when the hippopotami hitthebottomi thought they were gonna drown but i saw them walk on the bottom i saw them pop up from the bottom i thought they were cute
now why would nature evolve this they also easily overheat so they need to be in water often to cool down and yet they sink like bags of bricks nature is weird like that
on road off road no road truely all terrain terrors
i ve been telling people this for so long and no one ever thinks it s true
how do they get back up to the surface once they re on the bottom
just posting to see if its an issue with my internet or if the shitty reddit phone app again
my dog must be part hippo because she dos the same thing
do they ever down how long can they hold their breath
ah and the hippo took a shit the true hippo aquarium experience
my god you mean that poor momma hippo is trying to save her drowning hippo baby and we just sit there and watch like savages terrifying
just wanna add that the total weight doesn t really matter it s more about the density of their body so saying they re too heavy to swim is technically incorrect
are they in an aquarium or what are we looking at here what are those reflections of people
it s not the bones they are pure muscle hippos are jacked
are hippos amphibians sorry if that s a stupid question
according to all known laws of physics there is no way a hippo should be able to swim its big bones are too dense and heavy the hippo of course swims anyway because hippos don‚Äôt care what humans think is impossible
so the ones sticking their head out on bbc documentaries are really just standing on the bottom
baby hippos are really cute just that they have really deadly parents lol
lol they are big boned alright why cant they just admit that they are fat and hit the gym smh
these hippos must love living in water they can actually see in most wild hippos live in water too turbid to see jack squat
according to all laws of physics hippo‚Äôs aren‚Äôt supposed to be able to fly their big bones are too heavy for their body to get off the ground the hippo of course moves underwater anyway
i usually call them swamp demons for obvious reasons but damn thats adorable
ok so all my life i was told hippos can t swim then more recently i sat in on someone else watching a documentary and heard something like they used to say hippos can t swim but evidently this is just a myth going by what i ve found on google the myth was actually the fact and the documentary perpetuated the myth
that‚Äôs actually true haven‚Äôt thought from that point
this is why the hippos of the marianas trench died out
cool fact hippos produce something on their skin called blood sweat
according to all known laws of aquatic physics there is no way a hippo should be able to swim its limbs are too heavy to lift its fat butt off the ground nevertheless it swims anyway because hippos don‚Äôt care about what humans think is impossible
sooo no one is going to mention the speedboat that is shitting at the camera
i wonder if any dinosaur species could walk underwater those trex arms are ridiculously small but they would be perfect for turning underwater the tail would provide counterbalance as you moved through the water and the water caused your chest to lift up brontosaurus with their long necks would be able to go deeper to avoid predators
i read the title as hippies and got really confused for a moment
they are also one of the dangerous animals in the world
serious question how do they not drown i‚Äôd assume sometimes a hippo can overextend it‚Äôs stay or get flushed to the deep end and might not have enough time to reload on air
from now on i‚Äôm going to call hippos ‚Äúmoon pigs‚Äù and see how it goes
no wonder they are called nile horses in my language o dutch
so like that water aerobics class at the local pool
thats bullshit hippo‚Äôs are excellent swimmer all mammals can swim maybe except for giraffes computer models suggest they might drown because of their weight distribution no one knows for sure
holy shit they should really save those people in the water
so technically if a hippo fell into the middle of the sea it would drown if not near shore
look at that mama hippo play water pinball with its chubby offspring
i wanna see these beasts in full force i saw a video once a bait being charged by hippo not only was it bigger than i expected but that thing was a fucking torpedo
hippos may become sea mammals in a couple millions years like whales walrus and sea cows
according to all known laws of swimming there is no way that a hippo should be able to swim its bones are too dense to get its fat little body through the water the hippo of course swims anyways because hippos don t care what humans think is impossible
and it doesn t looks like it can make an crocodile run away with fear
this is me then the reason why i can t swim i need to come to terms with just bouncing along the ocean floor while holding my breath
this does sound like the beginning of the üÖ±Ô∏èee movie
aawww is this why they re always depicted as ballerinas in cartoons
went on a dugout canoe ride in botswana saw a group of hippos guy padding the dugout got us so far over the other side of the river so as not to give the hippos the impression we were blocking their access to the water we were practically on the land i said at least if they come for us we could run away he looked pretty terrified already and pointed out a hippo can run at km h on land the rest of the ride was basically spent in abject fear wishing it was all over already hippos are scary
come to think of it hippos underwater is like space for them hippo one small step for hippos one giant leap for hippo kind
excuse me this is not a hippo it is a blubber butt and a land whale
holy shit i just realized hippos are manatees that evolved legs
i wonder how good a hippo would be on the moon they ve been training for millions to colonize the moon
don t mind me just gona take a real quick shit and back to our lesson
imagine being a hippo and getting swept out into the abyss
im not the only one googling can hippos swim right now
less aww when your realize the parent is taking a shit
does that mean they would get stuck if the water was til deep
if they can t swim how do they get to the top of the water if they are in deeper water don t they sometimes kind of float on top do they just breath in a ton of air to float up
i live not too far from hippos and had absolutely no clue they couldn t swim
oh im dumb for some reason i thought this was in the wild even though hippos live in muddy gross water not bright blue pool water
imagine being able to punch so hard you can crush a hippos jaw
ummm is it poisonous if yes then i‚Äôll definitely kiss him
since that kinda looks like a blue poison dart frog i m gonna have to pass
how hard would a person trip if they kissed that frog
if i kiss him but i ll die i see ni downside to kissing this frog
üé∂if you never been frog kissin you don t know what you ve been missin üé∂
before i do anything i ask myself would an idiot do that thing and if the answer is yes then i do not do that thing
last night i had a dream i found a miniature frog and instead of ribbits he made cute little squeaks
hmm kiss it and die or not kiss it and run away as far as i can hmm hard choice
i think this is a drawing i can t find a frog that looks like this one besides pictures of this one in various art forms it dosen t look like a poison dart but a white s tree frog that s significantly more blue
meeeeee but i wont cause it might hurt his skin hes so cute
my cat is a black fluffball just like this and i love the little pink tongue
sure he is if he weren t he d get up and walk away or just slap his friend
sorry this was less of an awww and more of a laugh out loud thanks for the chuckle
he looked unnerved at first and then just went with it
well as long as he asked for consent first everything should be okay unless the white kitty did some catnip before they went into the room then it doesnt matter because she probably wont remember in the morning anyways
total trust the other trusts the other not to slap the shit out of him whether the licker is going to take a nib or not and it will definitely happen that s the part we didn t get to see
first seconds bob violates tom s armpit last seconds bob just helped tom discover his new kink
that face when you discover you are into a new kink
i do this to my girlfriends they all hated it but i try to find the one
i don t think he can either he s got like a i m going to be sickened by this until it turns into a fetish kind of expression
my cat does this exact same thing when i lie with my arms behind my head little weirdo is obsessed with my armpits
he s certainly not enjoying you lookin at him they re all like look normal look normal
that slow blink by a cat at minimum says ‚Äòi trust you‚Äô and may mean ‚Äòi love you you are family‚Äô
more like ‚Äòhey hooman what is this cat doing i don‚Äôt know i don‚Äôt know what to do help me ‚Äô
the slow blink is the tell that he is pleased closing one s eyes is letting your guard down which is a huge compliment from a cat
when you don t share bae s kink but you do it for them
he s enjoying it but he s wondering why are you filming this
finally a gym where i can work on my cat like reflexes
just like a cat he is sitting closest to where the most recent butt crack was placed
now you‚Äôre speaking my language what‚Äôs the situation here
pre summer bod pic i‚Äôm sure in a month from now we‚Äôre gonna get a ripped kitty six pack pic
you know it s fake because everyone knows cats are lazy
you can tell that absolute beast has just finished a serious sesh
he s gorgeous those eyes what a little doll congratulations d
he‚Äôs beautiful and my friend had a very severe cleft and had the surgery and you cannot tell
no not because of the face or anything but because babies aren‚Äôt cute i‚Äôm sure they will be a great human being when they grow up
first of all he is an adorable little guy but that setting makes him look like he was abandon in an attic in a worn torn country
he really is very handsome so mature and pensive for a little guy
as someone with cleft lip and palate this is too adorable
he s adorable love his eyes he looks like he s quite an aware little baby
newborn and already looking his folks in the eye he s gonna grow up to be independent as all get out and a treasure to his family
he is so rad looking you have to be a photographer or hired one though that picture blanket set up bokeh vignetting wasn t a quick photo but it is very well done
what a precious baby like many others her my cousin had a cleft lip pallet and had the surgery damn kid is better looking than me he is going to ‚Äúslay‚Äù the ladies good luck little guy
i also have a cleft palate and lip and i never believed anyone who said i was handsome i see how wrong i was

look on the bright side he ll be great at cosplaying the predator when he grows up
oh my what a little handsome dude you have there lady killer for sure

he looks like a moth in a cocoon soon to be a butterfly
look at all that hair oh man what a sweet little guy i m crossing my fingers my next baby has hair
i didn t know such a thing was possible what causes that also he s so cute
all i see are those beautiful wise eyes and the even more beautiful soul behind them
the three year old i nanny was born with a cleft palate the other day he told me when i was a baby i broke my palate and had to go all the way down to the doctor i think he sees it as bragging rights
he has so much hair what a cutie slightly jealous though i was bald till i was
congrats i‚Äôm holding my one day old son at the moment and it‚Äôs great your son is extremely handsome
he s gonna be a heart breaker when he s older so handsome
so handsome fellow cleft palate and lip person here a well

let s be honest here if you build your dog a house like that it ain t sleeping in it
freaking dogs house is nice than my landlords sobs in millenial
now that s a proper dog house i think you should add a small mailbox
your dog has a front porch and i don t have a room üòÖ
you kids get outta my yard and come squeeze onto my porch
looks like that poor struggling shrub has been peed on one too many times
i m suddenly realizing that i haven t seen a real dog house in decades seems typical for dogs to be treated pretty much equally to children now
the fact that the dog has a small fancy house makes it cuter
to be a good boi or to still be a good boi that is the question
nice any chance you have the plans for it i want to build something for our puppy to have shelter in case she gets caught in the rain
something hank hill would be proud of did you file for your variance when you poured the concrete pad

what did the mexican firefighter name his twin boys jose and hose b
that‚Äôs less a violin and more the child‚Äôs heart that she‚Äôs playing with
the kid is like i remember that song they played it in labor and delivery
the world we live in where we have to ask if it‚Äôs ok if our baby hugs you
bring a tear to my eye reminds me of the first time my son heard my farts
why did they have to hit him with balls and divert his attention
if he had a tiger mom that baby would be the greatest violist of all time
future violinist in the making beautifully wholesome
i love how his first reaction to the sound is to get as close as he can to it especially that little hug
ugh that s the best feeling for a musician having a kid be completely amazed by what you work so hard on is absolutely incredible most adults just look past you
almost as cute as the previous times this has been posted
yeah but if i do this it‚Äôs weird and the cops are called
me when i see we still have a kit kat hidden on the top shelf
that s like the most genuine sweet videos like in years that kids gonna be a violin prodigy because of that lol
leans for her leg sorry is that okay it better be or she s not human
in years this kid will be pushing their way to the front of the stage
stupid baby it s only a violin i bet he hasn t even got any a levels
well he couldn‚Äôt help falling in love with her sorry had to do it
am iÔ∏è the only one bothered that the mom just let the kid go right next to her while she‚Äôs playing for everyone iÔ∏è get it‚Äôs cute and all but get a hold of your child please lol
so staged that baby is clearly just a trained monkey s obviously
this kid just realized his calling he s going to be the next vivaldi
my bass trombone never gets this reaction from babies
there are videos like this and still there are some people who will swear up and down that people don t have natural affinity toward certain things there s not much more evidence anyone could want without straight up completely depriving a baby of music in some kind of controlled study
you can t blame him one if not the most beautiful instrument ever imo
aww sweet even he s a child he can actually appreciate real music
the fact she had to ask if it‚Äôs ok for a baby to hug her leg shows how fucked up society is these days
why the hell did i get teary just watching that it wasn t even sad dafuq it was such an amazing video
maybe he just really loved elvis any way he can get him i kid i kid got me right in the feels
i think my smile from this was the purest form of joy i have felt since i was also a toddler
well i think i‚Äôve just discovered a talented violinist this is sooooo cute
that is one of the cutest things i have seen all day the baby‚Äôs expression of awe is delightful for me and the violinist
had an extremely shitty awful day i feel a little better now
that is just to cute i love kids their reactions are completely honest
yup basically the same reaction i had to hearing a violin on youtube and that s why i started learning to play it last year
the violin is probably my favorite traditional instrument
my kid does this with billie eilish best best way to stop a hour long scream
can t help falling in love with you right when he hugged her leg
‚Äúand i canttttt helpppp falling in loveeee with youuu‚Äù how serendipitous
üé∂ and i can t heeeeelp falling in loooove wiiiith yoooouuu üé∂ stupid kid only fools rush in got em
my son at that age had the same reaction to the violin so many memories flooding back for me
it‚Äôs sweet but i just imagine that kid shiting his pants throughout that entire video
that kiddo could be the next djawadi or mozart or something new we haven t heard yet all borne of this instance of his hearing brilliance
isn t this a viola sounds deep for a violin but maybe my ears are off
that was clearly his mother throwing the balls at the end
it‚Äôs time to pick up my cello again for sure now so cute
only one of them knows the lyrics but i bet they re both feeling them
this video would look so good after years when that kid is the best violinist in the world
kind of off topic sorta not really but your vibrato is so beautiful and rich it s easy to see why the little man became mesmerized
when the baby does comes that close it s cute when i do it not so cute
‚Äúthat‚Äôs a myth no animal will turn away from its baby if a person touches it
so the violinist is playing can t help falling in love while the kid can t help but fall in love with the violin i love it
there aren t many times when you can legitimately use the word enthralled but here we are
arguably the cutest and most beautiful video i ve ever seen makes me want to have a baby and learn the violin lol
i d be super happy to her years from now that that kid followed his dream and became a musician himself might not be the case but it would nice i think
i m looking forward to the next time i feel like this
song sounds like can t help falling in love by kina grannis
is there a sub dedicated to gifs of toddlers waddling around and sitting in such a cute way because i m a huge fan of adorably unsure movements
my soul feels better watching this baby so entranced in the music music is magic
last winter holiday i got the pleasure of spending a week with my one year old nephew i had brought a guitar with me and i was doing some of my daily practice i saw that he was interested in it so i let him bang on the strings while i gripped some simple chord progressions the fascination on his face every time he successfully struck a chord almost made me want to have children of my own fun fact small children have no problem with conceptualizing harmony but they do struggle with rhythm so the performer picked a perfect piece for toddlers by playing something with many long drawn out notes
that is so sweet i just got a cavity seriously though beautiful
violins are just such an amazing versatile and beautiful instrument frankly if it wasn‚Äôt for a violin i‚Äôm not sure i would‚Äôve gotten so interested in music and wouldn‚Äôt have become the musician i am today
ugly tears snot the works this is the most beautiful thing i ve ever seen üò≠
wonder if he was experiencing synaesthesia little dude was unusually captivated and focused for someone that age
and here we see the birth of a future violinist as adorable as it is
one of the main reasons why i love music is that it is so captivating i can t wait for him to grow up to be an amazing violinist
get your baby off the performer how hard is it to wrangler a toddler
the kid made her day but she just might have pointed the kid to his destiny
indians give so much importance to sound now i understand why
didn t think the end of my day would be me tearing up so cute it hurts
according to twitter mom is a music teacher and dad is a broadway musician they are also both composers dad worked on the aladdin musical sometimes no matter how old you are you just feel it
i believe some people are affected more by music than others i also get hypnotised by all kinds of music even random things like indian wedding music i m a korean australian doesn t sound like background noise and different music can make me extremely emotional either excited sad inspired etc
stuck him in front of an year old beginner and let‚Äôs see if the reaction is the same
not gonna lie a few tears fell while watching this so sweet
i hope they got him a cd of violin music on the way home
well that‚Äôs me too anytime i hear can‚Äôt help falling in love
didn‚Äôt know what a biological clock felt like til today
this is so so beautiful how wonderful the violinist must‚Äôve felt and clearly the child too
that‚Äôs cute you can tell the violinist has a kind soul
my son is and loves listening to the cello and violin
this was adorable now i just reinforce that my masculinity still exists by punching a wall or doing something stupid s
is she playing cant help falling in love with you or what a wonderful word at one point it sounds like the first but at other points it sounds like the second
i usually hate babies but i like this one if only for just a moment
i don t know if i wish to be the baby or the violinist more
synapses going crazy in his head i can only imagine how his brain looks with all the activity as it‚Äôs taking all of his body and mind just to be closer to the beautiful sounds this woman is making it‚Äôs pretty amazing
omfg the bow tie was the icing on this cake what a cultured gentleman
get this kid a violin stat this is how i was with classical guitar and i didn t manage to get one until i was like
that is what music is right there look at how at the end he looks back and he s like holy shit how did i end up all the way up here
anyone else notice the lead singer of the vapors at the beginning of the video
my oldest plays the violin and the baby loves it so sweet
hey mom i love you so much ooh and you can play üéª violin i love you even more then hug ü§ó so sweet
when i was that small i used to do this when my dad started playing his guitar as soon as i heard the first sounds of the strings i d drop what i was doing and run to listen he s an incredible guitarist
a baby brain is able distinguish any sound‚Äã of any language instrument animal in the world
omg i m a professional musician and producer and this is so moving that kid is gonna be a good musician
i can t blame him i love the sound of the violin it s beautiful
‚Äúi can‚Äôt help falling in love with you‚Äù is the only thing i heard during the video
this little kid hearing elvis played on the violin for the first time reminds me of the first time i heard the beatles it was octopus s garden performed by puppeteers when i was like four and i still have that memory stored as clear as day
it would have been a new experience for him i lovely this video
the baby reaction is so cute i really love this video
i think the baby wants to play violin too he was totally adorably curious
bb i found my purse in life looking at this violin ü§§
thats awesome this is not nearly as good but i‚Äôve played gigs at properties where there were cows both times when we were playing the entire herd would come right up to the closest fence in the case of the st instance it was about a metre away it was kind of beautiful
hes going to grow up to be amazed at violin the musician must be amazed that a kid is admiring her hard work
that s proof that the youth like something else besides hip hop
reminds me of your lie in april where kids cry after listening to the violin i‚Äôm not crying you‚Äôre crying ‡≤†Ô∏µ‡≤†
i didn‚Äôt come here to see a demon i came to see cute animals
normally i m a bit too sober for this sub but this hits home what a great kid
i have a very vivid memory of watching an older kid at my school play violin during assembly and just being entranced by it i couldn‚Äôt fathom that someone could generate that sound so effortlessly i must‚Äôve been only like
not usually a violin fan but that was beautifully played
fun fact presleys falling in love is based on emile waldteufels opus les sirens op about in the song
normally i m a bit too sober for this sub but this really got to me what a great kid
pretty much every time i tell anyone about my situation
she should‚Äôve smashed her violin over his dome like ozzie osborne
its like his future is being played right before his eyes
this is a repost stop helping russian trolls get upvotes with this garbage please
she went from playing for a crowd to playing just for one instantly
the baby is amazed but when he walks up to the lady playing did you see her face light up from joy adorable
oh my god the little hug as he bumped into her trying to get as close as possible ‚ù§ so precious
i just wish they d teach him consent about touching but whatever
my month old loves the sound of violin and cello i play classical violin music when he is crying and it s an instant calmer
i it s b beautiful how can i learn this magic oh great lady of sound how doth thou make those beautiful sounds that you do üò¢
i was one of these kids back when i was or i was watching playschool and they did a bit where they showed an orchestra playing i couldn t get close enough to the tv told my mum very confidently that afternoon that i wanted to play violin years later here i am still playing and still loving it picked up an electric violin not so long ago am teaching myself guitar and looking at getting an electric bass sure i might be a bit more of a metal head now than a classical violinist but music is music and that one moment lead me to here if not for my parents instantly supporting my decision to pick up music and funding my lessons for years it s likely i would never have learnt any instruments music and me playing it has gotten me through so much and i m endlessly thankful for it whenever i perform busk it s always the little kids that stare in awestruck wonder at the violin you kinda see your younger self in them y know i just hope their parents find ways to support their musical dreams because goddamn is it a beautiful thing
that s the cutest thing i ve seen in a long time it s just so pure
it brought him closer to the state he was in his mother‚Äôs womb
that s awesome i still feel that way whenever i hear a violin someday i ll catch a live performance was she playing fools rush in i ve never heard that on a violin now that i have it seems so perfect
i like a child and their reaction i am really impressed for this child and i have like this video
when the goodies so good you wanna take a closer look
i feel like this is the opening scene of a biopic about a maestro
we forgot too many times how much wondrous the human kind is for the way our brain react to the music is a little magic
this is beautiful i hope his patents get him into music stat
if you can play the violin correctly it s definitely one of the beautifully instruments ever
i started violin lessons about a week before my th birthday in my head this is how it started
this is such a wholesome beautiful video thank you for sharing
i can see him in about years with his yellow shirt and bow tie and chubby tummy and maybe spectacles eagerly lining up to get symphony tickets and smiling through the whole performance
oh my gosh he s even got on a little bow tie i dont think it s possible for him to get any cuter
i watched the whole thing tears welling up what am i gonna post i thought then i saw the start of the video david bowie with a soccer mom mullet
shoulda seen this year old i used to babysit the first time i played mingus for her
that kid will soon learn that life is filled with violins and sax
what sappy parent had the violinist play that song at a kids birthday
this may sound weird but it makes me wonder if that kid had a past life and that sound sparked a memory
my daughter cried i realize it s been a long time since i played but that s the last time i did for the kiddo
that kid would grow up to be radio dj for the minutemen
if that was my nephew he‚Äôd keep putting his right hand out and say ‚Äúgive me give me‚Äù
that little man will definitely become a pretty good musician in years remindme years
i wish we could stay this innocent and pure forever its a shame looking at a better and knowing they ll just become a typical adult
everyone gets music and if you are one of those people who doesn t like music what is your coping mechanism because i would like to try it
that kid just failed its charisma saving throw it is now considered charmed
i have a feeling this kid will grow up to be a violinist
my nephew of a year and a half is the ssme with music and singing he gets totally absorbed by it sits still for minutes on end just to listen
well the kid confused about the sound and his reaction is damn cool
ok it is way too early in the morning for onions source musician
i love it definitely gotta get him some violin music for the house lol
oh my god typical males walking over women in the spotlight
i m not crying you re crying becoming a dad really messes with your compassion levels
that s the exact behaviour of my cat when i was practising flute
i love in the moment of ‚Äúfalling in love‚Äù kid hugs her legs the music really speaks for itself
either this kids going places or he gonna be a serial killer
my reaction was to hate it and feel embarrassed cos it made me feel emotions one of my earliest kindergarten memories is getting those puzzle pieces but not a puzzle cos the don‚Äôt fit together they just go on one board that has cut outs exactly the shape of the pieces with pictures of instruments and slamming the violin piece into the board as hard as my feeble arms could i now play instruments in an orchestra band and big band jazz at my school so uhhhhhhh
kids tend to love melodic instrumental music such as classical orchestral orchestral uplifting trance and some others catch them before they get sucked into crappy mainstream music for those who don t know what orchestral uplifting trance is check out the track one day by soundlift there s plenty more where that came from but it s one of my favorite examples to introduce people to the genre the tune is around min long but so worth it it s a musical journey
i can t believe how long that violin held his attention he was completely enraptured
my daughter cried the first time she heard violin music not a great wailing but one of those lippy tear up sad cries made me wonder about reincarnation
ugh can t help falling in love is fucking song it s dusty in my office all of a sudden
cuz i can t help falling in love with you he sure did
i was lt year old when this story happened but i ll try to tell it to the best of my ability so this takes place while i was sitting listening to children s time at my parents church and the person leading the childrens story was playing a guitar now i don t know if this was the first time i had ever heard a guitar but according to my parents i wriggled free of their grasp and ran crawled on all fours to the front and without hesitation i sat down beside the person and i put my hands on the gutiar body and i just sat there for the whole song starring at the person playing the guitar
i guess you could say he couldn‚Äôt help falling in love with that violinist
aw i was hoping he‚Äôd go in for a hug he gets closer then it‚Äôs like he‚Äôs trying to hold the music close to him so cute
love the violin if i could learn any other instrument it would be violin love the sound
i need a follow up did he grow up to become a master violinist
kids can enjoy pretty good stuff someone should tell those people that make kids programing
is she playing a secret garden song it sounds familiar but i can t quite put my finger on it
first time i heard a live quartet i cried because i had never heard anything like that before i couldn t control it it was true wonder a and awe
i was in orchestra and kids were in the school for some reason it was a saturday they kept running into the room and listening to the music with this amazed look on their face
now they just need to remember to practice hrs a day
is this ‚Äòcan‚Äôt help falling in love‚Äô by elvis presley
he either wants to play it or chew it i think either way works
that baby is either going to grow up to become a violinist or a pervert
she his mom what you expect it‚Äôs not the music believe me
sure but when i try to go and stand a foot away from a violinist i get ejected from the theatre
awww might remind him of something from his last life not sure i fully believe in that stuff but babies and really little kids reactions to things sometimes makes me wonder
whoever interrupted that moment with a geometric shape should be tarred and feathered
damn i love that song and hearing it on violin is amazing
buuuuut i caannt help falllling in love wiiiith youuuuu atleast im pretty sure thats the song
is this a viola or a violin it sounds a little low to be a violin but i am also not very educated on the difference
i hope his parents get him into music when he gets older
meanwhile my daughter freaks out if she hears the acoustic guitar
if it was a viola that baby would be stumbling in the opposite directionüò¢
that is the purest sweetest thing i ve seen this week especially combined with the song
song can t help falling in love by elvis presley pretty sure that s right just incase anyone was wondering
violin is an instrument where at it s brilliant but if you re at you d still sound like you re trying to strangle a chicken used to have a roommate who was a solid the baby would ve bursted out in tears with him
the power of music that‚Äôs so awesome to see such a young kid so drawn in
he was so entranced üòÜüòÜ i didn‚Äôt think that was possible
sidebar comment i like that when the baby hugged her his mom almost immediately said ‚Äúis that okay i‚Äôm sorry‚Äù great to recognize people‚Äôs personal space
this is when i hear kate bush i m runnin up that hill
man i don t even like kids but that was something else
this is the most beautiful thing i ve eve oh look a ball
k upvotes jesus christ you‚Äôre good at this karma farm bullshit
this is the moment this child fell in love with music i can‚Äôt stand this many feels so early in the morning y u do dis
he won t like despacito that s for sure there s still hope
he ll become a second paganini cuz i think that paganini is the greatest violin player of all time
a lot of the respect to the mom for asking if it was okay
is there a sub for babies or little kids doing cute things
this kid has already figured out what they want to be when they grow up i‚Äôm and i still have no damn idea
how fucking weird this kid has a future i‚Äôm thinking
sometimes when i‚Äôm playing my guitar my parrot starts whistling and dancing along it‚Äôs one of my greatest joys in life l
does anyone know the name of the song melody she s playing i feel like i know it but just can t quite put my finger on it
chance this toddler is recognized as a genius by the age of
teach me oh human mom what sorcery is this and yes i am not crying lying on the bed
aw he is so adorable it doesnt surprise me if he becomes a violinist when he gets older üòçüòç
can confirm this happens at years old my daughter heard live music for the first time a mariachi band she was absolutely transfixed with her eyes staring in space focusing only on the music and nothing else
that baby likes him some thicc violinists i prefer thicc pianists holup
that was my nephews reaction when he heard the star wars opening theme
baby these strange‚Ä¶noises resemble my crying sounds but it‚Äôs‚Ä¶different beautiful even
for someone who used to play the violin and haven‚Äôt touched it in many years this reminded of why i even started in the beginning this is so damn cute next time i‚Äôm at my parents house i‚Äôll definitely pick it up
and at that moment after listening that beautiful song somehow reminded him of someone a love a love he couldn t say goodbye before if only they knew he was back again a hug was given to remind her she was loved and he still remembers her
i hope his parents plan on enrolling him in violin lessons
he is wearing a bow tie so we know he has some class his reaction is so genuine
this has to be one of the most beautiful things i‚Äôve seen on reddit so w h o l e s o m e
meanwhile most kids are rapping cardi b or singing taylor swift
i know there are other comments and no one will see this but i think this may be my favorite video i‚Äôve ever seen on reddit and i spend quite a bit of time here
this is really cute and i love that the kid loves the music but this seems like a really lame birthday party i certainly would not want to be forced to sit around and listed to someone play violin karaoke to music from my parents generation
not only is the reaction of the baby sweet and adorable the person playing the violin is seriously skilled this is an all in all perfect aww post i would give gold if i had money
this shit is straight fire ma don t let me stop you
i can t stop smiling üòÅüòäüòÅ an absolutely heartwarming reaction interaction
violinist sounds great but her fingerings are baffling
as an infant and toddler teacher this reaction didnt suprise me it did melt my heart to watch this tho because it is such a genuine learning experience for that child and to see him appreciate it made me happy
that little boy then grew into a man named elon musk
such a beautiful reaction to such a beautiful sound he s enraptured
"awww
i love this this is a great way to expose toddlers to music just allow them to roam free on the mats and be them toddler selves"
i went to boise for under grad and boston college for everything else studied medicine
i mean your schedule is not that hard but y‚Äôall had a hell of a year oh boy did i love see sabin fall to so many no names
i mean yall should have put up more points all ways next year is what i say
michigan has not been super in a while while stanford has been a joke for a while too but deep down i‚Äôm a boise and auburn fan
it‚Äôs all good brother have a blessed one keep posting that pupper
rabbits are like cat dogs my kids had two when we lived in china and i was absolutely against it at first until the white one took a liking to me i literally fell in love it passed away and i cried for days my daughter who it belonged to could have cared less given she was at the time and didn‚Äôt really understand or make a strong connection it would hop toward me and reach up my leg until i held it we would cuddle while i fed it for hours i miss that damn thing
i want to hug him and squeeze him and call him george
awwww reminds me of our bun not at all in looks just in cuteness getting nose licks is the best
i only clicked on this to see if you‚Äôre supposed to pick a rabbit up like this or not waiting for the horror stories
this makes me really sad had a rabbit for years that died used to follow me around the yard climb on me while i was working under our car loved that little bunny
friend do you have a girlfriend me well yes but actually no
my rabbit would be seething with rage and fear at being picked up loves being pet hates being held alas
i m so confused when i looked up info on owning a rabbit they told me rabbits didn t like being cuddled or pet because they re prey animals and might die yet i see all these people cuddling these adorable fluffy poop machines d
these things are so violent this man must have a calming effect over animals
my friend s rabbit sugar dose that and we call it sugar kisses even when it s not that bunbun
oh my god i don t think i ve ever seen a cuter bunny the big feet the fluffiness the little licks
if you tried to pick up my bun like that he d scratch the crap out of you he just doesn t like being held he does kiss on the nose though cute as heck
i got my nose bitten scraped that exact same way i was or something clack the rabbit was iq as well
hes not kissing he was checking if your nose tasted alright be happy that it didnt or he would remove it with one bite rabbits are viscious just kidding i like to be dramatic
last time i saw someone hold their rabbit up it pissed in their face this was incidentally the first time i met my sister s husband
when you wife finds out your cheating on her with a bunny
my bunny doesn t like to be picked up but she do love cuddles she also is very territorial so it s hard to go inside her enclosure without her being mad don t know what to do about it but she runs happily around whenever i come near
that was really cute but was i the only one kinda hoping that during the parts where the bunny was licking that guy s nose it would bite it and he says ow motherf er or ow that little bastard bit me i can already imagine the honk sound effect with the bite p
i did this with my old rabbit when i was a kid she bit my nose
rabbits digest food utilizing coprophagy that makes op a real brown noser
i babysat my neighbors bunny over the weekend and he gave me an elbow kiss my life has never felt more complete
haha seems like a chicken what a wierd dog is it a chicken it it is a chicken
legit thought this guy was maybe till the camera came around
this is cute but i was mildly disappointed to see that camus wasn t a cow

me and my girlfriend wanted to adopt the oldest most unwanted dog we could find at the shelters but im scared of the vet costs that would come with him or her would i be horrible for adopting one and just giving it a decent end of life experience without spending k in vet bills or should i avoid adopting all together if vet bills scare me off
i can see people either adoring this post or absolutely ripping it to shreds
sorry guys i know it‚Äôs a repost but it got deleted because of the watermark earlier sorry again
i have so many feelings about this bear mainly very impressed a little bit uncomfortable i want one lol
hmmmmm what happens if you act like a bear and approach another bear
the only proof that it s not a real bear would be an unbroken chair
the bear and the old house reminds me of annihilation
i really want this to be for a children s show but deep down we all know it s for some upcoming furry convention
it‚Äôs fabulous also i have so many questions can you see out of it how hot is it inside the costume who would win in a fight between you and the bundaberg rum polar bear
most people cosplay as goldilocks not the three bears
i would be very honored if you be the bear to my goldilocks
do not wear outdoors during bear season just sayin wow that s good work op
didn t know they were gonna do a humphrey the bear live action movie
after a long day at veridian dynamics do you wear it to the park and do bear stuff you know just to unwind
people in animal costumes has always been something i hate needless to say i did not enjoy disneyland this is also disturbing but very well executed
i m more amazed with the fact that you thought this bear how to read btw next time upload an picture of your actual costume please
this costume is unbearably realistic i ll leave now
would absolutely love getting chased by this then getting a super realistic bear hug when he catch me
you should pretend to be a taxidermied bear and just scare the hell out of anyone that walks past you
i want someone to wear this in a furry con and walk on all the entire time getting to know everyone but half way through we replace them with a real bear
meme comunity missed you chack testa welcome home u
that s incredible so naturally i had to check out your profile which led me to find your website you have some truly awesome work
nice try you big bear motherfucker it‚Äôs a real bear folks waiting for its next victim to walk through the door look at that cheeky look on its face
he looks like a serial killer who has been waiting for you to come home
this is amazing and so well done i admit i did a double take absolutely fantastic
op the pranking potential of this is unlimited do not stop until everyone you know has been attacked by bear
can i buy one how much bears are my favorite animal and i would love to wear this every halloween
i m working on one too lots of funny costume variations you can work with pm me if you want to hear some fun ideas
i needed this back when i was a scout on camping trips the opportunities would be endless
can i borrow this i want to walk around the city late at night
i m the kind of guy to wear this thing inside a mall and just go crazy
i don t have a problem with the furry stuff but i am distressed about the relative lack of references to nic cage in the wicker man
i really like this bear i don t think it looks scary reminds me of an old show i think it was called bear in the big blue house
its all fun and games until someone calls animal control and you wake up with a sore ass in the middle of the forest
was that after you smoked out of the gravity bong on the stairs
not realistic everyone knows bears read in the woods
this sure took a turn i was just trying to say i liked the awesome bear costume and make a reference to gt live y all also was my yell and sniff joke not cool like was it offensive i saw that it got a lot of downvotes if so i apologize that wasn t my intention
i m not a furry and i love it it feels very jim henson s workshop to me very well done
was that you catching that fish with your mouth at the zoo
wow that s taking being a furry to a whole new level but seriously great job
the bear is cool as shit but so is that space the floors and the walls are incredible
you need some beats and a battlestar galactica helmit
i would love some instructions on how you made this
outstanding do you have a fan in there or any ventilation what is the nose made out of the eyes are so realistic almost as if they re looking at the camera are they movable
you should wear it to a furry convention and call everyone else an amateur
one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us
i finally have a visual reference to that better off ted episode thank you

cute foot paws could be a bit larger to achieve better proportion though
should pose reading goldi bear and the three people

hello i am bear max i will personally end your other healthcare companions
my god i should have not clicked on this high i m just really emotional about this little doggo for some reason he is so nice i just want to be his friend

nice my brother just got q little chocolate lab i word of advice keep you hands out of reach of that mouth those razor sharp teeth will latch on to anything within reach amp x b but it is still worth the pain of the bites for the cuteness
i can remember when my labrador was this cute and small and then ‚Äûall of a sudden‚Äù he‚Äôs become so badass and giagantic however is still preety dummy
tell them you thread the male end of the clip through the metal loop before clipping the collar together common mistake oh and cute dog
i have a year old black lab enjoy all the years of ball throwing water games and them taking up more couch space than a human
i don‚Äôt know if anyone else brought this up but did op decide to stop and take a picture in the middle of the road
ah the unrelenting hunger of the elusive cake goblin
i don t even like cats but i think i found my soulmate
what the heck was that looks like a character from harry potter
this is sm√©agol but he s trapped as a feline and likes cake
not really a kind way to handle a cat yes it a cat redit
i agree that was awful how that poor innocent cat was handled
you could have saved the cake just by letting him have a bite
i love that brief pause before he face dives into the cake
my children are too sharp and bark poorly but they are handsome and strong
and to think that st bernard is that big and it s still just a puppy
that‚Äôs so cool seeing a cat take on the mother role for those puppies
that is just so beautiful it very nearly brought a tear to my eye
‚Äúwut human are u kinda dumb or something these are kitties not puppers silly human ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äú
i scrolled past this a couple hours ago like yeah yeah big dog cute puppies üòÜ

what a beauty like everyone else is asking whats the breed
earth‚Äôs mightiest defender against the forces of barkness
someone photoshop a hammer in his paw dogthor strange
you may come to regret that decision it s brought you face to face with the master of the mystic barks
misread the title saw the picture pfft more like dogtor strange
i m glad he chose tony bark instead of the time stone
the moment before i upvoted this it rose by k truly his powers are supreme
dogtor strange human i have come to bargain for a treat human no the vet said no more than two a day dogtor strange human i have come to bargain for a treat human dinner is in two hours you can wait dogtor strange human i have come to bargain for a treat
if he did surgery on me i would just be having a strange day

you can have my upvote for not missing out on the pun
this dogs name is merly she does a lot of cosplay and travels to different conventions her instagram is thecosplaydog
well he is a wizard it seems reasonable he d be an animagus too
clearly far too good a girl to fit the origin story though
you need to be careful with your cat around the baby
what there a note with a list of demands left after the cat took your baby
if you so much as wince you will be severely paw nished
two adorable heart breakers you are sooooo screwed ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
haha now you will stop crying constantly and i will get all the scraps attentiom and scrstches and pets muahahahaha
you do realize that your cat is trying to murder the intruder right
i didn‚Äôt say you could speak tiny hooman obey your kitty overlord
just an fyi bacteria on their paws is bad even for adults it comes from walking in the litter box if you clean the cats paws properly you should be good though adorable picture though
my normally docile cat who loves my baby just recently scratched her across her face and drew blood without any warning so just keep that in mind
my parents had a gigantic and very sassy seal point siamese who was their first ‚Äúbaby‚Äù he was when they adopted me their first human child i was an infant and he apparently loved me and was extremely protective of me if i was in the nursery he was in the nursery if i was getting a bath he was right up on the counter ‚Äúsupervising‚Äù when anyone but my mom or dad would hold me he would plant himself right at their feet and stare with that laser eyed siamese gaze making sure no one hurt his ‚Äúcharge‚Äù he loved sleeping with me in my crib as well of course i grew up to be a kitty fanatic
here eat this toxoplasma gondii you ll grow up to be a total badass with no fear
from the looks of it it looks like she is taking him away from the fridge
is the kid letting the poor thing breathe on this fridge excursion
take me to the vet human wrong subreddit to say the least
i think this cat needs to stay away from the fridge as much as possible
wow that little girl is already training to be a power lifter
omg i love this pic i had a cat named sally that looked exactly like this one same size and everything
people need to be shown the same cruelty they show to animals
ignore the mean comments it s hard to control a cat you could buy every single lock and auto food thing in history of mankind cat will still find a way in to eat as much as it wants as saying goes you don t own a cat it owns you anyway beautiful cat
the bread loaf belongs in your mouth silly human then you can also be a bread loaf amp x b this is kinda sad honestly i hope that cat s okay
if the ever do a live action version of secret life of pets you have the perfect chloe casted already
is there any way this is photoshopped just me thinking this child cannot hold a pound cat
how does a cat get this fat i have seen a fair share of obese cats but this is insanity even compared to them
the green cabinets are killing i want green cabinets
i want to see this cat on four paws standing up it may be that because he s elongated in the girls arms he looks chunkier than he actually is regardless if he s really that big when he s standing normally you gotta get that cat to a vet like now
live action garfield starring sir patrick stewart as garfield
this cat is a british shorthair which is a naturally large breed healthy males can weigh up to lbs their heads are especially round this one looks like he could definitely shed a couple pounds but he‚Äôs definitely not supposed to be a pounder
do you guys play games like this with your pups do you know if they enjoy it it just seems so cruel to me do they still get a nice treat afterward
the lick of the lips in anticipation then the shock then the tail stops wagging
i feel like that dog might want to bite you for that
i have been tricked backstabbed and most probably bamboozled
i will hurt you for this i don t know how yet but give me time a day will come when you think yourself safe and happy and suddenly your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth and you ll know the debt is paid doggo
dear diary today my hooman was the umpust cruel vile low down nasty s o b to have ever existed i sat there in shock at my possibly no longer owner wondering what could make him betray my un ending affection to the food giver master of scritches was i long longer his good dog wearer of banana bandanas today i pack with each toy i place in my luggage i have a memory of each throw each tug and every last good dog said and it gets harder and harder to pack i must leave this treachery has gone to far it was fold worse than fake throws this heinous crime is absolutely positively un for give able
doggo kinda deserved it use your nose husky it s the most incredibly powerful sense you have silly
goddamn it karen disappointed doggo is disappointed
tfw you eat a chocolate chip oatmeal cookie but it s raisins
while it‚Äôs fun and laughters please do not feed your dogs cooked meat with bones cooked wings drumsticks are really dangerous and can cause the brittle bone to splinter and pierce their gi tract
like the dog with it‚Äôs insane sense of smell doesn‚Äôt know that thin piece of cardboard isn‚Äôt a chicken dinner beforehand
you can watch the realization sink in as his tail wags slower to a stop he is very unamused
i feel this dog die inside every time i see one of these poor pupper
hello darkness my old friend i ve come to talk with you again
wait this forced perspective only work from the viewing angle of the camera this would mean the dog would not be tricked into picking that bowl it is as if this gif were staged or something
he gave the i m going to shit in your shower now look
did the dog really conclude that there is better food in there do we really think the picture fooled him or he just thought that food was below the picture
several months later the story in news will read man found dead only clue is the picture of fake meat next to him
what the hell is this karen you think this is funny am i a joke to you karen
for people who doesn‚Äôt understand chinese it means ‚Äúshit and piss a lot‚Äù i don‚Äôt get the sense of naming the dog either
whot is this hooman you trick me this isn t real food it is same food me not happy üò†üê∫
"‚Äúyou think that‚Äôs fucking funny ‚Äù
the face of betrayal"
i have received that look from my husky many times usually accompanied by a sigh and eye roll i swear she was part human
are are you kidding me oh so my choice doesnt matter is that it im not even surprised anymore unbelievable
his name hahahaha his name is too funny my god hahahaha
am i the only one that thinks this trend is kind of pretty cruel
this is proof butterfly‚Äôs are adorable to more than humans
spongebob was right butterflies are so powerful they can kill full grown cats o
my cat would just relentlessly killed it and then eat it
i think i would have had to put the camera down and help the poor girl
as cute as this is i find it uncomfortable to watch
why does clicking the link bring me to a month archived post of this but clicking the comments link brings me here
people for real the guy can t help his arm ain t long enough and mom barely fits under the house as it is so he wouldn t the puppies are under the house so going inside the house isn t going to help use common sense people
this gif kept looping and i was wondering how many goddamn puppies this dog had
that‚Äôs really not good for their backs my friends dog had to be put down for a spinal injury from doing something like this
if i didn t see this i would ve wondered why the pillow was on the ground
i probably would have layed down on the hard ground wishing i was able to enjoy the comfort of the couch and its plush pillows
let me film my dog while he fucks up his spine for the sweet sweet internet points
i like the short series of hop attempts at the beginning
meanwhile i show a chair to my dog so he can use it to climb on my bed and the idiot keeps trying to get up there in one leap cockers loving full of energy but dumb as fuck
it would be worth it to get a ramp for the dog these dogs have a history of back issues
build steps for him and have more rugs it helps their back and keeps them healthier longer
my weiner would just jump dat shit little fucker jumps like a cat
pillow may have been comfier but he wants dem butt smells
man i was really invested in that little guy making it up there smarty pants
got alternate ending with tyrion lannister assuming the iron throne
one small step for the doggie one giant leap towards kanine dominance
help the pupper out you monster i‚Äôm just kidding still cute though
then jump down after the pillow and jumps up with it
smart dog but not smart people to promote mutant breeds
its fucking bad for his back dumb owner should build him steps ffs
used to be that what made us human was the ability to use tools i think that theory was dismantled quickly
if you buy a injury ridden breed like this while being aware of their problems you should probably just off yourself
i definitely hear hannibal buress in my head while watching this but i m not clever enough to figure out what he d say only hannibal buress would know
now he needs a little stick to pull the pillow back up
who says dogs don t think there super smart just because there not completely self aware like us doesn t mean they don t think and have feelings
the dog has learned to use tools lock your door when you sleep
this is actually amazing this dog is clearly and purposefully using a tool there are not many instances where dogs are known to do this and they are generally not supposed to possess the cognitive capacity to do so like eg primates or corvids do
he looks at the pillow the first time like i won‚Äôt use you today then realized his defeat
i am super short and i can really relate i am one with the step stool
my doxie had back surgery because he jumped off a bed he was temporarily paralyzed after the surgery he now has his own steps to the couches and beds in the house we will be getting him a ramp for the outside steps next
pillow adds like half an inch and then he is able to do it lol
meanwhile while old boi still refuses to use the set of stair i built for him
looks to me like she didnt need the pillow just needed the confidence from the pillow so human
our wein is and just learned he can jump on the couch now he runs from the other side of the house jumps up and slams into me they re a lot more athletic than you would think
smart boy gotta have that jump traction my rabbits just keep trying the hard way because they arent smart boys
that‚Äôs elite problem solving with dire physical consequences
mine does the same thing with his blanket also won‚Äôt sit on hardwood instead he finds the closest carpet and backs up onto that
is this technically an example of tool use in animals
i totally have those same couches they recline right
my dog has trouble getting onto my bed because of how high it is so i let him use my pillow to get up much like this dog
that is actually a huge step for the doggo using something as a tool is an incredible sign of intelligence
this makes me miss my long hair dachshund i loved that dog so much
get him a step it saves their backs which are vulnerable on long dogs he is very smart boy
genetically disabled boutique animal needs assistance to climb up
dachshunds are the weirdest mix breeds i saw a super dachshund which was a pitbull dachshund mix they had long legs huge chest and were bulky but kept the long body the runt got the dachshund legs but also got the pitbull chest it s chest almost dragged on the floor
this is the reason i dislike breeding munchkin cats
this dog has better problem solving skills than my human nephews
this looks eerily like my old house and is scaring me just a little
impressive from below predators have tough times seeing it from above predators have tough times seeing it and yet it¬¥s incredibly colourful from the sides to impress it¬¥s kin
had one of these adopt my family he came back with a wood duck three years running he just hung out on the deck with all the other critters i miss them
‚Äúi drew the duck blue because i ve never seen a blue duck before and to be honest with you i wanted to see a blue duck ‚Äù
i remember first time seeing a picture of this duck and thinking it was photoshopped
we have many wood ducks on our stream the north american cousin of the mandarin also beautiful in a more muted fashion
what is hard to capture in a photo is the beautiful iridescence of the colors which shift with the viewing angle and the lighting my two cents
reminds me of the color pallet of s artwork in florida hotels
man how much effort would it have been to quote nietzsche correctly
if you glare long into the abyss the abyss also glares into you
everyone is like ah evil eyes but they re probs actually happy squints
at first i thought it was one picture with two cats and was like that would be a great plot the story of two deamons living with you the one nice and naive the other a partyanimal trying to seduce you all thetime
omg i thought it was fake but its real and adorable‚ù§üê±‚ù§
whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster and if you¬†gaze¬†long enoughinto¬†an¬†abyss the¬†abyss¬†will¬†gaze¬†backinto¬†you fredrick nietzsche
the abyss is displeased that you disturbed its slumber please make an offering of wet food
‚Äúhow did you find my lair leave or suffer my tiny wrath ‚Äù
it‚Äôs like a split personality cute amp sweet in the first picture and out for murder in the next be safe
st picture face she makes innocently reaching for your fries nd picture face she makes when you slide the plate away slowly
and when you and i both looked into the abyss you want to know the difference between you and i you blinked
everyone s focused on the angry eyes and here i can t get over the absolute cuteness of the happy face pupil level
if we re about to die anyway i d rather die fighting come for me g mork i am atreyu
the oh you see me and the i am going to kill you in your sleep
its shiny lets murder it vs they said vet lets murder it
ah the joys of owing a black cat lol he s the cutest of all ours but i can t get a good picture haha
fake image but ok i can see the pixels get a real one and i will upvote you
i swear as i was scrolling by the eyes on the cat seemed to blink i think my monitor s refresh is trying to scare me
the picture on the right looks like that scene from shrek when the king is making a deal with the puss in boots lol
literally one of those cartoons where they‚Äôre in a cave or a dark place and it just shows their eyes
probably i can even read the thoughts behind these eyes
this reminds me of a book i used to read in school but i can‚Äôt place it
that second picture is like the perfect take a picture it ll last longer expression
when you hover over a chuzzle with your mouse for too long
i absolutely loved my black cat especially for this reason when all of their facial features are obscured except their gigantic eyes hilarious
gt we both looked into the abyss but when it looked back at us you blinked the context for this quote comes from nietzsche s quote beware that when fighting monsters you yourself do not become a monster for when you gaze long into the abyss the abyss gazes also into you
i looked into the abyss and the abyss gave me a gun any takers
me when i see a box of pop tarts in the pantry vs me when i find out that the box is empty
reminds me of the nothing coming out of the darkness in the neverending story
that looks like a glare not a gaze and you should probably retreat to safety
looks like one of those jeeps with the angry headlight covers
honestly if i m alone in house and seeing those eyes would surely terrify me
we both looked into the abyss the only difference between you and i you blinked
when you diy convert your headlights to angel eyes on the left factory installed angel eyes on the right
all i see is toothless and all i remember is the first scene i saw the character
the left looks pretty timid and the right is absolutely furious hey this is a great symbol of american politics
is that real or a doll idk what to think anymore anyways cute eyes
he who would hunt mice must take care that he himself not become a mouse no that doesn‚Äôt sound quite as profound
cat looks really pissed that you are looking at it that s hilarious though
for i am the night and this shelf is the bringer of my darkness the cat probably
hey i didn‚Äôt know there were new photos of black holes
üé∂üé∂ we re standing here by the abyss and the world is in flames üé∂üé∂
the right side reminds me of the headlights of a jeep with the angry grill
holy shit you scared me hooman ok hooman you can stop staring at me now
looks like a happy nightfury followed by angry nightfury toothless
can someone please explain what nietzsche meant by this
oh hi i didn t see you standing there how awfully embarrassing now leave me the fuck alone or else
there is a difference between you and me we both looked into the abyss but when it looked back at us you blinked batman
the abyss looked freaked out and then decided to put on a scary face i have a black cat so i know of this transition
before cat is nice doing its own thing after owner says i am a flat earther cat thinks owner is an idiot
in this case it appears like if you look into the abyss long enough the abyss will come out and smack you
that face when the adventurer gives the wrong answer to the riddle
does anyone know if they are a specific kind of black cat the big round eyes and all
you think darkness is your ally you merely adopted the dark i was born in it molded by it
that pair of eyes looks like it s trying to tell you something
looks like the abyss is pissed and gonna come for me any moment now
dduuuuudddeee my two cats do this on the bed at night stop freaking me out
never have i gone from aww cute to scared for my life so quickly
just had a nightmare about this shit were i died lol
the first pic is like o hey come closer and the second is just you done fucked up
happy kitty sleepy kitty purr purr purr angry kitty frowning kitty grr grr grr
it s incredible that such simple shapes can be so expressive
i don t know what you did op but those second sets of eyes tell me it must have been quite terrible
is that your cat if so can we get a normal pic of them
it s like those black ghost enemies in majora s mask
if you relax cross your eyes you can merge the images and have sets of eyes staring back in a d environment
when you whisper to the void does it whisper back master rahool
cat just found an efficient way to clean his feet after burying a fresh turd lol
the most cartoon looking eyes that are actually real
at the edge of the universe i stared into the infinite deep it stared back and was pleased
i thought this was one picture with two cats and was giggling at how different their expressions are it s still cute now that i realize it s one cat tho
one of the abyss eyes are so cute and the other s are so scary
that abyss needs to come live with me that is the cutest abyss i have ever seen i am squeeing into the void
kitty turned into a modern sporty car with halo lights
is that an owl or a cat joking of course whatever it is it‚Äôs adorable i want it
in soviet russia abyss gazes into you yakov smirnoff
it looks like when a cartoon character is in the dark and you can only see their eyes
nietzsche failed to mention how adorable the abyss is
it looks like an angry furby on the right the height and eye size is just perfect
i can t get over how it goes from a look of surprise to a look of pure anger
that‚Äôs night fury alright from how to train your dragon
remember in shrek where fiona‚Äôs dad meets puss in boots for the first time
who ever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster and if you gaze long enough into an abyss the abyss also gazes into you friedrich nietzsche
i half expected it to be a gif and the tail would have been the kitties bro sis haha what shampoo does it use i may have to get some haha
i d groom it with pledge r and let it run around the house
maine coon cats the supermodels of the feline world
love maine coons i have two at home and even though they are beautiful the best thing about them is their personality they are very curious sweet and playful only down side is that you have to vacuum the house times a week
that is a gorgeous maine coon we‚Äôre getting a maine coon kitten this summer and i‚Äôm so excited so far my kids want to name him bob hoping to change that
this is the prettiest cat i have ever seen and i‚Äôve seen some cats in my lifetime
holy crap that‚Äôs the most beautiful cat i‚Äôve ever seen
strangest horse i ever rode couldn t keep up with the convoy and meowed whenever someone stepped on it couldn t pull shit as well
hey any chance this is taken in brighton uk i swear i saw that majestic creature in pretty much the same setting when i was there on vacation
smooth as the wall i m trying to climb to reach my dreams yet i d be happier climbing a huge fluffy cat i keep slipping down but this cat is helping me
the genes of this cat seem certain to find themselves reproduced prolifically
why is everyone talking about a cat i m pretty sure that s a pokemon
his tail is really looking like a waterfall it s beautiful
this cat is prettier that some of the people i know
this cat is about to give you a mystical side quest
i wish to see the giant who throw that stick to that boy
at some point it stops being a stick and just becomes a tree
he‚Äôs so happy and proud of what he found just could t wait to show his owner how good he did
you guys realize this is fake right at one point during the video the stick clips through the ground and the shadows on the stick never change as its moving edit its also a repost
damn this is why these breed of dogs should be used by police
the log could be rotted out and lighter than it looks my pitty always carried huge sticks around as well but they looked heavier than they really were
tree branches like that are heavy i had one break off a tree and land near my car once i tried to pick it up and move it but man was it heavy now watching this dog carry it with its mouth its fricken jaws man this dog got good neck genetics is all im saying
how many times must this fake video be posted i swear this is the th time in the last week at least
someone please make this doggo fly away like the wright brothers
wow fantastic repost ever post any oc or strictly reposts
if you‚Äôre not even a little afraid of that dog then your situational awareness is lacking
therefore theodore roosevelt is the goodest of bois
wow i ve never seen this before wow wow wow wow amazing wow wow wow wow
wow this is so fresh and new wow wow look at that dog do that wow so fresh and new
her how do you know it s hard to tell for a cat call two names and chose one later
shadow if she likes to hide a lot i had a small black kitten a little while back and i swear it would enter another dimension and then re materialize when we called her name
girl susu japanese for soot boy holl√≠n soot in spanish

a cat is a cat is a cat even the young saharan murder floof
the actor for the new lion king is a total camera hog
every baby s favorite game alongside can i stick my finger in here
kinda looks like an old man trying to figure out how to work his phone and then yelling in frustration üòÇ
this is weird but where i worked three years ago they had a go pro station that would play this among others video on a minute loop i would always check to see if the baby lion was on because it was good way of knowing if minutes had passed weird to see it here
too sad that it s a repost the original picture is from u linhbbk
i would like to think she would say ‚Äúnot impressed‚Äù
what did grumpy cat do in a previous life that she got reincarnated as an apple
that s more than enough cuteness needed for the day
electromagnetic peddle and paw on peddle no way a dog has better timing than me til i might be worse than a dog at music
now lets strap drum sticks to his paws and see what happens
i like the yawn in the middle ‚Äúcan we try something in cut time ‚Äù
r dogswithjobs yea yea yea i‚Äôm on mobile already know üòÇ
unfortunately this is not real watch the dogs arm it doesn‚Äôt move plus you can tell the paw is not real if you look closely
it looks like doggo is just resting his paw on the kicker while someone else plays cute though
visited in the ‚Äôs because the gif is not as smooth as i would have imagined
looks like a lot of fun just don t tell elmer fudd about that place
is there an explanation on why the island has so many rabbits genuinely curious
oh my god that s amazing i need to add going there to my bucket list
i went to the island of women and was disappointed went to the virgin islands and was disappointed too
seems like a great place to propose amp x b p s your wife is beautiful
her skin color was a bit off in the thumbnail at a glance i thought she was wii fit trainer lol
do they sterilize some that would end in famine if population explodes
i was born in the year of the rabbit maybe that s somewhere i need to visit
i imagine this was what they imagined for the end of watership down
how big is this island and do the rabbits just breed freely and live life are there too many to provide healthcare to are there dead and dying rabbits all over the place i guess is what im asking
rumbling what was that rumbling there it is again guys comes running down the road run op what guy ruuunn hundreds of rabbits come hopping in synchronized hopping after the guy crushing everything in their path op oh crap
op s wife is enjoying a dozen rampant rabbits at once
i went to a place they called monkey island off the coast of vietnam it was definitely not peaceful and relaxing like this i regret my decision and now i want to go to rabbit island instead
the perfect evolutionary development make yourself adorable to people
i love all animals so i m honestly not trying to be some cold asshole but isn t having that many rabbits openly reproducing bad for the plants life and animal life of that island
i don‚Äôt know which is cuter the rabbits or you two enjoying them
no this they are friendly people probably just go over there to feed them all they do is just take food from people
i wonder if this place was any inspiration to the rabbit rescue in spirit tracks
do japan have an island for every animal i have heard about the cat island before this but the rabbits is new
why isn t this place full of people i mean it s good it s not crowded and stuff but how isn t there more people
this might sound stupid but isn‚Äôt it like a minefield on that island rabbits poop alot
wow that camera video quality is amazing how was this recorded
this seems like fun until you run out of treats learned that the hard way when i almost had to get stitches from my flemish giant deciding to bite almost to the bone on my right pointer finger
this looks awful for me rabbits are like the one thing i m super allergic to
i never knew how much i loved rabbit island until i saw this
omg is this in japan i already have visit cat island in japan on my bucket list i swear they just have lots of islands there dedicated to cute animals
i feel like japan has an island for every cute animal cat island deer island fox island and now rabbit island
interesting fact there is a rabbit hierarchy on this island that separates different personalities the friendly confident and aggressive ones stay on the bottom of the island and the shy and timid ones are driven to the top of the hill the ones at the top do not interact this way
seems like they should introduce a predator or are they stockpiling the bunnies for food
i ve been there such an amazing place apparently the rabbits are there because the island was previously used for something i m not sure what and the people there killed all of the predators there the island was abandoned later on and the rabbit population skyrocketed
ugh too sweet i just got a cavity these buns look sooo soft and well taken care of i didn t even know this place existed
imagine the number of ticks on those rabbits and they re just hold in em dear god
i wanted to go a year ago but time ran out because you basically use all day to go there i plan to visit japan again and see the rabbits i used to have in my home and they are great pets
attending wrestle kingdom used to top my bucket list for japan now there is this
i ve been there before for my birthday it was very enjoyable
literally grabbing my hair exclaiming to an empty room how unbearably cute it all is
everything is awesome must be running through the minds of hundreds of rabbits on repeat and on every single day here
wait so japan has a cat island and a rabbit island üòçüòçüòç
lmfao that one rabbit who was sleeping with its belly out and when heard that its feeding time flip its belly and start eating from sleeping to eating real quick imagine their life being sleeping eating fucking lmao
i didnt even know that island existed thanks for sharing üòÅ
the equivalent of a people dad getting a pic with his son on a climbing frame
two seconds before this was taken he was yelling at his kid
most common repost i ve ever seen to the point that it causes me to feel physically ill when i see it thanks for that
were you born yesterday this picture was taken on sony eriksson in before berlin wall fall
a puli i love these dogs they re so stubborn and i love stubborn dogs
has selective breading gone too far they are now breading dogs with mops and calling them mogs
that s an incredibly patient komondor clearly it doesn t even register the little dog as anything coming close to warranting the slightest attention tremble at the komondor s power
reminds me of the sheep dog in the old looney tunes cartoons
‚Äúvery troubling the sky is yelling at me and i don‚Äôt know why i‚Äôm in trouble ‚Äù
mine runs in the guest bathroom and slams the door behind her goofball
thunder must be so much louder to dogs and animals with better hearing
my giant irish settler used to do this whenever there was loud noises i d be in an armchair and he d drag his big body onto mine and i wouldn t be able to move
my dog is physically rock hard poor guy has hip dysplasia and never makes a peep he once had a wasp stuck to his paw after getting stung and the only clue was him constantly licking the paw coincidentally i got stung the next day in my calf and i yelled out in frustrated pain shit hurt some rumbling thunder or fireworks he‚Äôs a trembling mess i love my physical tank emotional marshmallow
i wonder why a vacuum fireworks and thunder sound so evil
my handsome potato always hides under me like between my knees or will try to burrow beneath me if i m laying down but always grumbles that i don t have enough under to completely hide him from the thunder
hah my cat is the same way if theres a storm in the middle of the night he ll paw at me until i get up and sit with him have had some pretty random am xbox sessions the last few summers while he s curled up in my lap
one of my housesitting clients has a shepherd malinois who is terrified of thunderstorms they have a ‚Äúthunder shirt‚Äù for him and it‚Äôs very calming
ohhh poor sweetie ‚ù§Ô∏è our german shepherds we had when i was growing up were also terrified of thunder‚Äîand fireworks üí•
mine was terrified of thunder too but my son who is half the dog‚Äôs age thought thunder booming was fun and now my dog isn‚Äôt afraid as long as my son is with him he‚Äôs even tried to wake him from naps when it‚Äôs thundering and lightning
my dog isn t afraid of thunder or fireworks however because i might be afraid she will bravely come and defend my shins by wrapping her entire pound self around my legs
geez dude you‚Äôre living the dream take care of it all
i just recently had the probably single thunderstorm of the year here it hailed i love thunderstorms
i wish mine reacted so calmly he thinks the sky is picking a fight with him and he takes it out on his stuffed animals in response
this audio made my pupper sit up from a dead sleep all freaked out üòÇ
our lb catahoula will straight crawl into your lap when it‚Äôs storming poor baby loves his thunder shirt too
poor guy reminds me of a dane who was as frightful he had a neurological issue tho glad to hear kevin has an abusive happy home now lol
welp this is the best thing i‚Äôll see today thank you
how can something that can literally rip me apart be so cute
reminds me of the woman who climbed the fence because she was convinced the bear was waving her over
fake the bear is a man in a realistic bear costume in an earlier post
what‚Äôs aww about this poor bear in what looks to be a zoo begging visitors for junk food
‚Äúand my friend seabass over there says he‚Äôs going to pay for it ‚Äù
any place that allows you to feed the animals and where the animals know they should do tricks to get food is horrible this poor bear lives in a concrete enclosure with dirty water this isn‚Äôt ‚Äúawww ‚Äù it‚Äôs extremely sad
looks like it s helping you park a car go yes continue c mon you still have space go go
someone needs to remake this with a dozen bros in the background who start screaming when he catches it
i thought bears had poor eyesight therefore poor hand eye coordination
i like to think that the video cut off right as the bear was giving a thumbs up
love the casual seat he s taking while performing such an incredible feat
his confidence would make me cave in seconds i‚Äôd throw him everything i own
some bats are cute i think my last encounter was a little brown bat at least it did not have white nose afaik
bats are great fun fact vampire bats can run on land at up to mph due to their strong hind legs
just be super careful with wild bats iirc the most likely animal to carry rabies in the us definitely adorable though holy crap
am crazy for bats love to watch them diving and darting for bugs around my house even under the awning just by the window
yep i m with ya skycubs are fantastic and charming creatures
when you play the game of cats you gonna win with us as long as you accept your place n don t make any fuss this human fren allowed to sit upon the wooden throne he understand makes no demand n none of us he own no sword he wields or armor worn is cat hair he prefer so regally upon the throne he listens to us purrr allowed here in our kingdom much relax n acting cool he understand arrangement we are cats is we who rule
so many gorgeous tabbies and i love how that one is sitting all the way back in the barn like he‚Äôs in time out or just can‚Äôt be bothered hanging out with the general population
i have that already a ton of work witch i gladly do
i knew i d find my soul mate on the internet one day
hasn t this dog ever watched survivor everyone knows if you play too hard too early the other players recognize you as a threat and eliminate you before you can get to the merge
the victim really felt that that agonized awooooo face
this is my corgi times when racing another dog for a ball he doesn t bite but he barks right before the other dog gets to the ball in an attempt to force an error it s quite embarrassing how competitive he gets
why are they racing corgis isn t this wrong or is it a joke
that is one heck of a disagreement they must have been discussing got
wow i guess lulu really really wanted the outside lane
stuff like this makes me think people organize and get together for things a lot and i just sit at home or drink at a bar or a friend s house
well i supose thats one way but the other corgis are way ahead of him now
not sure why this was posted in this thread because i m not saying aww that poor corgi looks mortified
based on this information my money is on solid start and a focused attitude a very good boy
corgis are cute but they definitely can be nasty i had a female for a few years then brought in an adopted male corgi she hated him from the get go and the fights were awful and often ended up in blood and disfigurements including ears nose chin and other scarring even squirting them with the water hose wouldn‚Äôt stop them at times the only thing i could do was get a snow shovel and try to pry them apart with it
they need little fairy jockeys for this to be authentic
omg why does this look like a corgi renaissance painting
then when reaches the finish line first gets disqualified so is declared the winner there will be an uproar of how unfair that is
i literaly whatced a corgi race for my first time on youtube today
this went exactly how i expected a corgi race would üòÇüòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£
if you can‚Äôt beat the competition just eat the competition
oh there s cheddar you have trained her well captain
knew this was gonna happen and so delayed his start you can see is going for is gonna slip through the chaos to victory
been to the park many times with my boston terrier can confirm that corgie play is hostile
the other dogs look like they bouta copyright his idea
call my mama fat one more time i double dog dare you
so i m guessing their names just by the looking at this picture number is another one number is dust
number has his looks on number heheheh great picture
unfortunately there is too many to bite them all this maneuver costs the biter as much as the bitee
idk man it looks like that doggie is really biting into that other lass there
waits out the mayhem trots for the win gets many treats and hugs
this reminds me of my mom s corgi i never knew a dog could be so cunning and vindictive she was jealous of me and used to poop outside my bedroom door
boii is it just me or did i hear that dog bark in pain when i first looked at it üòÇ
i m just playing son all i wanna know is did ya shuck her corn
they knew number was trouble check out that hand coming out from its stall to grab it unfortunately too late
can‚Äôt lose the competition if there is no competition evil laughs in corgi
where the hell do corgi s even race also i want to go
gotta not upvote or downvote because i have a phobia of bees and that kind of stuff and i wont downvote because its cute
might be a new favorite quote the see you later pollinator
bees are so fuzzy and cute gotta love the little dudes
see you later you re not planning on squishing this fluffy one are you
i got stung for the second time in my life today bee hitched a ride inside on my shoulder and when i felt something i reached up to brush it off not knowing it was a bee she got me man somehow i m the one left feeling bad because i know she s dead now ‚òπ
more than likely she s considering drilling a hole in your window case so her that larva will have a comfy home
i was afraid of bees for years because a wasp stung me yes not a bee but tell that to year old me basically anything that buzzed frightened me i got a garden plot last year at and realized my apartment building spread pesticides that killed things that make bees happy although it made me nervous i planted some native plants for the bees because while they scare me i know they are good creatures i have slowly come to be okay with the bees buzzing around my flowers still make me nervous but working to help them has made me feel less frightened
oh god bee doc doof saying no poll inator doc doof saying yes
my co workers think i m a little strange but maybe i can get some support here while walking to my work truck last week i saw a little common honeybee crawling on the ground little dude was tired lacking honey or anything like that i dissolved a little bit of glazed donut in warm water and poured it on the ground next to where he was he sipped rested and a few minutes later he was on his way doing what bees do which is pollinating the crops that we humans rely on my co workers still razz me and have taken to calling me b man granted it was just one bee but we all have to do what we can
how the fuck does one allow that to sit on its window and not burn the house down
this looks like a male carpenter bee what do you think
i planted a bunch of lavender last year this year i am having a lot of these cuties over at my place
i saw the biggest fattest bee the other day it was huge and amazing he just flew on by to go crush pollenate some flowers this just reminded me of that
i‚Äôve been trying to feed one just like him with little success the last month did he have a collar on
i m so glad your little fluff butt came back now tell him not to do that any more
wow i can t even imagine the stress you must ve gone thru for a month my spookyboi got out one night and my girlfriend and i couldn t even sleep thankfully he came back in the morning though scariest night of my life man but glad he s back with you
i tried that freedom thing hooman and it wasn t for me
he was out spreading his genetics around ensuring the future of his species is hard work
poor guy so glad he found his way home wouldn t it be amazing if they could tell us all they went through i know you re going to the vet today and probably already have but make sure he gets dewormed given flea tick preventative and has a blood test done to check for fiv and felv feline leukemia since he could have contracted illnesses while out and about interacting with other cats hope he gets a clean bill of health and is able to settle in like others mentioned get him microchipped as well if you haven t that way if animal control vets shelters pick him up if he gets out again he can get reunited with you a lot of times pets are found and brought in but if they have no collar and no microchip they go into a stray hold for a few days to weeks dependent on local mandates and then adopted out we ended up with a clearly indoor month old kitten this way in dec when we found him and did everything possible to find his family but without a chip had no luck
better keep sitting on him and he won t be able to run away again
my orange boy went missing for days lol yes we were keeping track thankfully we found him safe but he was skin and bones too went from lbs to ish now he is a well rotund lb chonker glad your fur baby is back home and safe gotta love the i m never doing that bs again cuddles
cats are weird my moms cat disappeared for about a month when she moved to a new house he was at the time so we figured he ran away to die came back like nothing happened went back to his satanic self he is also an orange tabby and is still enjoying life today glad you got yours back
omg i cannot imagine my sadness if my orange cat ran away but deep down inside i really want him to have the adventure of a lifetime too
don t worry he s gonna be fine had an awesome adventure defeated some awesome foe and has now returned victorious to be taken care of by his loving family only to go on his next adventure and take on the ultimate enemy the tomcat
my ex s cat would make a successful escape probably once a year each time he was usually gone for weeks and always came back skinny and beat up pathetically meowing at the door as if to say i fucked up please let me back in then the little idiot would keep trying to escape learn your lesson lynx the outside is no place for a delicate feline such as yourself you obviously suck at hunting and fighting
i love cats and i always will let my cat outdoors my advice to anyone who gets a new cat is to leave it inside for atleast a month it will learn its new home look out the windows memorize the location play with them alot brush and treats once in a while then when you feel it is a good time let them out they will come back because they know the area and you were loving them and giving them all those treats and good brushings
i lost my cat for three days and it was the worst ever how d you find him he just waltz home
yesterday my cat was officially year missing im happy for you that your cat came back
when you tell your mom you re an adult now but come back some time later with your head between your tail
ahh it s nice the cat is keeping him company while he gets better
this happened to me once it was the hottest it gets in my country ¬∞ c and my black cat was gone for weeks i kinda accepted she was dead when suddenly she was in my kitchen again
that is so cute happy that he s back keep us updated on the vet
general thought is that if someone does this they should activate their flashers so people coming behind them know something is going on most drivers aren t necessarily going to expect a dead stopped vehicle in that traffic
this video makes me want to barf even though there s a happy rescue
this is nice and everything but dont do this a very high likelihood that you will be killed for a cat
the car that caused the tumble had me clenching my cheeks so tight glad that baby is okay
i fucked up recently i went to get gas it was pm at night i got in my car and started to drive minutes in i heard a meow my phone was on youtube playing a video so i was like the fuck did that meow come from my phone i thought its been minutes no way theres a cat in my engine etc couple seconds later i saw heard a thump on my rear wheel i drove back but she was already dead i fucken hate myself if i just processed it faster it all happened in like seconds but iono i fucken hate myself
my heart stopped and my belly lurched poor sweet little kitty what a horror that must have been for him so glad he is safe
not worth stopping traffic this stuff can get somebody killed not worth a cat
a slight plus is that the drivers all made sure to go over or around the kitten sure they weren t kind and didn t pick it up but still
i officially love the person who rescued this poor lost kitten
oh wow bruh he was probably so scared i don t even want to imagine that fear
is just me or did i see it been thrown out a window
can we get a slow mo bot to show the first few frames v confused as to how this all started
i think the rescuer had people maybe his kids in the backseats i like to think he handed the kitty to the kids who then cared for it before driving off
that poor thing was so close to getting squished so many times
what kind of animal would throw a kitten out a window
i am sorry but i am not stopping on the freeway for any animal not even a kitten puts way too many other people at risk
hey honey it s me yeah i ve got dinner hey how do you feel about chinese
what a mothetfucker would have thrown kitty out of the car on a highway hope its ok
give that guy a gold star random acts of kindness are always beautiful to see
that kitten definitely didn t fall it looks like someone tossed it for sure but it s good that someone else finally picked the little kitten back up to take care of it
looks like nobody is behind him so i don‚Äôt know why so many comments are bashing him for stopping the people who were swerving so close to the other lane to avoid it were being much more reckless not only did he save the poor animal‚Äôs life he probably prevented an accident by getting it off the road so everyone else can drive straight good for him
lives that mofo had about lives up up down down left right left right b a start
been there done that now she hates me and loves my daughter cat really has some problems
those first few seconds nearly gave me a heart attack
give this man an nobel prize cause he fucking deserves it
btw he turned on the hazard lights before getting the kitten very good man it looks like the kitten was under the engine and fell
despite knowing the kitten getting rescued i still was so anxious for them
excellent another fine addition to my restaurants cuisine
what happened did someone actually throw a kitten out of a high speeding vehicle onto a busy motorway
was it just chucked out of the bmw i swear it seems that way
that is how people die keep playing on the interstate
who did the video and why didn t they rescue the cat
his life almost ended poor little guy i‚Äôm glad this guy saved him that wasn‚Äôt gonna end up well üôè
this is the stuff that should be tagged nsfoe not safe for over emotional im just super cryie right now and can‚Äôt this type of feelings
my kitten was found one year ago on the freeway by a motorcyclist she s a great cat she was only a few weeks old
did someone throw that kitten out i would go liam neeson on them
this happened to one of my sister s cats he had climbed up on something underneath and fell off when my sister was driving down the road thankfully is was a mph lane road and she saw it happen in the rearview turned around and the kitten was fine i would bet this kind of thing is not that uncommon
fuck everyone in this video both the drivers who swerved to avoid it and the asshole who stopped in the middle of traffic all of them put everyone else s life in serious danger i feel sorry for that kitten but you never swerve for an animal and you certainly never stop for one
plot twist this took place in china and the dude was just hungry
omg i feel so bad for that kitten we need more people like this
"that kittens a legend
also why did the guy just boot gang the kitten"
while it s a great act of kindness and humanity it s also how huge pile ups happen on motorways
this actually made me cry cause on my way to work one day i saw a kitten in the left lane of such a busy street i was in the middle lane and immediately started screaming at the top of my lungs and tried to make a u turn so did two other girls in another car unfortunately by the time we were able to stop someone else had hit the poor thing we spent five minutes on the median crying despite never having met ever this was last month but every time i drive down that road i wish i could reverse time and save that poor creature
tbh i really wouldn‚Äôt care if they can‚Äôt navigate around me and the critter lives i reallwouldnt be considering any consequences if there was an animal in danger just the way i‚Äôm wired
if herbie wants to tell me he s a beautiful cow i m happy to believe him
i think herbie is exceptionally helpful i would like to see further adventures of herbie helping
very handsome herbie bit attention seeking though aren t we
he s so gorgeous üòç donkeys don t get enough love for being so freaking cute
herbie and olive are gorgeous and i hope they get tons of grass and love forever
that s a wonderful picture and a super sweet looking donkey i love herbie and olive that also looks like an amazing pasture in sure they are incredibly happy üòçü•∞
i d love a print of this but i see the watermark or whatever you call it in the corner are there hi res versions of this available or other i d love to look at this guy in my home office
wow this is one of those photos that look too good to be real great job
you know i‚Äôm not usually a big fan of hdr processing but this is very subtle and well done
ahhhh poor baby i am so happy you found the little guy and he is on his way to the vets now sending well wishes lt
cats always seem to know where to go when they need help
poor kitty let us know how they get on they look like an old cutie but it could be malnourishment
props to you for being a wonderful human being bless you for this
aww poor girl hope she isn t suffering from any internal issues that s pretty common unfortunately with stray kittens
poor little thing i‚Äôm so glad she found you you‚Äôre a person after my own heart please do keep us updated üòª
it‚Äôs a she btw calico markings are a giveaway it‚Äôs extremely rare to have a male calico cat but good on you for taking care of her hope she gets better
hi cute little fuzzy congrats on finding a nice human
oh man i‚Äôm so glad this poor baby found its way to a good hearted person good on you for helping her
poor thing but that s all about to change this is the day life gets better for this little one lt thank you for saving her

a little tlc and you will have a happy little floof in no time
op it s been four hours we need an update on little munchykins
aww poor thing reminds of the state my cat was in when he found us he s been my lovely boy for years now
please give up us an update and let us know if you plan to keep her or not
it is a beautiful kitty give it a home you will not regret it the best cat i ever had amelia who lived to be over years old because that was how long i had her was a mutt cat that no one else wanted she had the most awesome personality and the most loving demeanor
best human ever this little one sure needs some love
i want to know also hope she‚Äôs ok even though it doesn‚Äôt look like it good vibes
i like noodle sounds cute and unique i ve never heard of a cat named noodle
oreo is my grandmas cats name so i like it it fits in with the black and white fur
every th black and white cat is named oreo thats an actual scientific fact trust meüòÇ anyways name it noodle
how about soba that‚Äôs kinda cute and noodle related or sushi she kind of looks like an onigiri haha it‚Äôs a cute cat just for the love of god don‚Äôt name it oreo
you can t see the claws because of all the floof but he has his murder mitts up i imagine he is just waiting for the foolish human who thinks he or she can pet that floofy tum tum mayhem awaits
that‚Äôs like one of those kids pillows that fold in half to make an animal his fluffy hands his face oh my
my cat does this it wants to play human trap it s kinda fun but it kinda hurts she also seems to enjoy it for like seconds but then gets agitated some cats are hard to figure out
no no your getting it wrong i ve mcfallen and i can t get up
it looks like the cat eats at the all you can eat kitchen there and that‚Äôs one hungry kitty cat but oh so cute
poor thing his owners should be ashamed of themselves for letting him get so fat
you missed a purrfect opportunity to title it help i ve fallen and i cat get up still a great photo though
this is what i would call a kitty facemask what you do is put your face right into the center of the floof cloud and it ll automatically latch on with it s helpful grabbers leave it on until your face has been floofed to perfection or you die from bloodloss
when i saw this i thought the cat was on the ceiling
yes karen i am stuck and no i do not want my picture take
this cat is just surrounded by its own fur and it‚Äôs so cute
i didn t think it was possible for a cat to be this fluffy and yet here i am being proven wrong with this adorable fluffy ball of floof
lovely portrait i guess you re glad you don t have a goldfish as a pet beautiful dog such gentle eyes
def don‚Äôt need kids to have an awesome family portrait love this
that s amazing the tiny morsel on the left doesn t even resemble a bird and now he s gorgeous
what‚Äôs his name please share more information about him
the one on the left looks like a couple jelly beans that melted inbetween the couch cushions and was found when looking for loose change
weird fleshy popcorn kernel into a beautiful rainbow
when i lived in flagstaff az one of these guys appeared suddenly at my feeder it began to hang out with the black headed grosbeaks and by the end of summer it was part of that flock when the grosbeaks left in late summer headed for s mexico the lovebird disappeared i ve always hoped it went with them
i love the markings on the head along with the eye color majestic af
about to hit you with the muhammad ali of right hooks
when i was a kid my dad said that somali cats are the most gorgeus cats in the world i never belived him until now
look at the mitts on that cat unreal looks like a lab puppy s paws
my sister has two of these a red one like the above and a blue one the blue one is grayish
had a somali cat growing up they look amazing but so needy very similiar behaviour to a dog in their personality
that meow meow carries a fair amount of smack down in his posture
you spray painted his tail to make him look like jinxy didn‚Äôt you
i spent all this grooming money get in the corner where it s no fun
see this horror here this deformed fur child is the result of uncontrolled furry breading every year more and more cross breed abominations have to be put down thanks to wild and unpredictable yiff pairings of furries this has to stop please if someone you know is a furry have them spayed or neutered it is the humane thing to do
i‚Äôm really not a cat lover but that is a seriously good looking cat
i m not a cat person allergic but that cat is majestic looking
no that‚Äôs a fox with a cat face photoshopped onto it
short hair in the front long in the back cat has a mullet
looks more like a cheap fursuit made by a chinese factory worker no offence just a joke üòÖ
why does it look like they attached a housecats head to something elses body
is there a subreddit for rare uncommon animals feels like i m always seeing new animals which blow my mind so was wondering if there was a specific subreddit for them
looks like my abyssinian i guess somalia isn t too far from egypt
beautiful üòç i saw cats chains at www fasionity com they were so cool and on special thought i might share üòç
huh is this a long haired cat and a short haired cat at the same time
this looks photoshopped his front legs are so disproportionate compared to head it s weird did they breed them to crack nuts or something
i have an abby the short haired cousin of the somali they re mad as a hatter but so darn fun they re basically dogs that say meow you can even train them
looks like a furrier abyssinian i have an aby at home and the face is exactly the same
had usual somali called theo dude was an absolute legend he arrived as a kitten when we had chocolate point siamese within the year he was top cat and he ruled by being the lovliest dude on the planet everyone just liked him cats included i would go into the garden to get my bike to go to work and just say his name he would come charging out of wherever he was hiding just to come say hello i would sit on the couch and hear him come bursting through the catflap galloping into the front room just to jump up onto my lap and hold his head against my forehead for a while before settling down for a sleep absolute legend
reminds me a lot of a red abyssinian cat very pretty i wanna pet it
really cute picture but i think it s touched up too much
i love thick pawed kitties i knew one a long time ago handsome little devil named jacob
i‚Äôm not a fan of cats but if i ever did want one this would be the one üòÅüëçüèª
so that s what a ca de t swapped foxbody looks like
head looks out of proportion with the rest of the body
does anyone else have the urge to chew on his legs in a non aggressive non sexual way
the only worthwhile thing to ever come out of somalia
looks rather similar to an abyssinian just a longer coat mix breed
impressive cat even more impressive photo it s perfectly balanced and exposed as all things should be
oh wow so gorgeous how much are these usually and are they hard to find üòä
why couldn‚Äôt the government have offloaded somali cats instead of somali people
kinda looks like lynx with a cat head it s got to be one of the most beautiful cats on this planet because i ve switched from a dog person to a cat person after seeing this picture haha
somalis are gorgeous i have a cat that is somali cross maine coone and i had never heard of somali cats until i had her i have to say the combination is quite beautiful inside and out üòã
wow this cat won a contract with elite model management and a cover and fashion spread in seventeen magazine
it really looks to me like a couple different animals photoshopped together but apparently it s a actual cat nice
hey it s errol his instagram is errol the somali cat
this is errol the cat on instagram op please credit
this is a crossbreed of two closely related breeds as far as i can tell somali long hair and abyssinian short hair
i am so not a cat person but that is a beautiful animal
kinda looks like the head is photoshopped even though it s not
i would love a cat like that and would name her neko for neko case
did your cat go to the vets recently only ask because their front left leg has been shaved midway up
probably has a higher iq than its owners if it s living in somalia i hear the average iq over there is
my mom use to raise a ton of them back home apparently they re super chatty
i m assuming they re mean piss on everything and aren t good house cats
that tail those gigantic paws purr fection enjoy peace

you are good people please tell nanook he is a good boy and happy birthday from a random internet stranger he looks so fluffy and happy i too have a huskey and that is a day i dread as well
it is very hard to know that you will have to say goodbye just keep the memories close and the pictures all over the place he wouldn t want you to be sad
happy birthday nanook you look fabulous and i hope you enjoy your party that your loving family is giving you üêæ üíï üêæ thank you for sharing your beautiful friend with us hugs from me and sniffs from my husky joseph
but look at that smile i‚Äôm sure you humans gave him the world and let him know he‚Äôs the best boyeü¶¥
happy birthday to nanook we just lost our almost year old siberian husky girl last month it has been very difficult we spent this past year trying to give her the best life with snacks more hikes car rides and just tons of cuddles i like to think she lived a very good life i do miss her so much especially her soft ears can you please give nanook a big hug for me
just remember all the quality time spent together totally worth it
happy birthday to nanook i know what it s like to lose a dog as i lost my westie back in february she would ve been come this april but unfortunately it didn t work out never forget to tell your pets that you love them and always cherish the time you ve spent with them because they ve surely been overjoyed to be a part of your life
"happy birthday nanooki
it hurts a whole lot to lose a pet especially when they re a family member i want you to remember that you have made each other very happy and if nanook could speak he wouldn t have it any other way"
this is why i don t know if i can get another big dog i mean i will i love them so much but god you fucking asshole why do they have to have so much shorter lifespans i feel worse when my dogs die than most of my human family it s crushing
well duh it crawls how else is it gonna get around outside the water
that is a dog who is doing his very best to look friendly and non threatening what a sweetheart
that‚Äôs when the trouble began that smile‚Ä¶that damned smile
i did a smooch at him and that s when he smiled that s too cute
the smile at the end was all the reward i could ve asked for awww indeed
goddammit goldens are the only breed that tempts me away from my beloved rescue mixes it‚Äôs a good thing they are prohibitively expensive
this is the first time i ve seen such a reaction to my presence
how many times is this going to get posted with the same title
every time this gets reposted the quality gets worse lmao
if anyone s wondering what the owners account is it is aarun evolution i m pretty sure definitely worth checking out
this video made me self aware that im scrolling through reddit feed i should go and be productive with base reality of this cuteness overload

yes hello smiley boy may i boop your snoot you seem like the absolute goodest boy
that s just what happens when you leave food next to your monitor

my son would be right in there with them he is no fan of the big booms
i have to look at the photo far too long to see the little guys i don t blame them one bit
brother we must be patient for the storm will only rage on
what s the lumber for that s oddly short for what looks like x s
two bros chilling in a wood stock five feet apart ‚Äòcause they‚Äôre not gay
imagine how cosy it is there feeling of safety rain hitting the roof smell of wet wood and rain nice i want to be a cat
we are the keepers of the wood have you brought offerings from afar
took me way too long to find them i was zoomed into the water looking for lobsters for some reason
i didn t see the cats at first and i was trying to figure out which of the two planks of wood were brothers i m very tired
should have brought them into the house for a bit warmed up the fire and let them get cozy before eventually letting them back out üôÇ
what kind of man stack woodpile like that for real there are too much wasted space
awww i knew they would be hidden but it still took me awhile to find them i kept looking towards the bottom of the woodüòÜ
i thought the brothers were two trees until i saw the cats
is that pressure treated wood on the bottom if so look into it before burning it may be toxic but i m not sure and too lazy to look it up
i see the outdoor stack of wood and all i can think about is the spiders that are gonna crawl into their butts
do you know how long i stared at this picture trying to find the two brothers ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÇ
didn‚Äôt see them had to come to comments to figure out
for a second i thought the tarps underneath were jackets
pretty sure this is the most adorable thing i ve ever seen
and here i was thinking the caption was referring to the two piles of wood as if they were brothers when they were still trees
nice cats but you used slate tiles for the roof of that thing are they common there because that s expensive here and why only layer or is there an under layer we dont see
didn t see the cats at first only the wood and bricks and assumed this was some weird three little pigs joke
reminds me of when my two were still outside they d hide under our deck when it rained i was always worried about them whenever the weather was bad fortunately since we took them in we don t need to worry about that anymore
a video of how they got into the position would be interesting
did anyone else immediately look at the ground under the tarp like i did lol
thought it was about two little mice bottom right of the wood
dang it jim i told you we should have waited in the tree
i guess you could say they re p y yes i m censoring myself deal with it
my dumbass though it was those thingds on the ground thought it was two tiny frogs just sitting up
am i the only blind motherfucker who didn‚Äôt see them
brothers waiting out a storm and then a meteor hit so what are you gonna do about that
as a chimney sweep i‚Äôm just happy to see a well built firewood seasoning shed
is that trex on the bottom of your pile i wouldn t burn that if it were
haha it took me about half a minute to see the cats
can i come over and straighten out that pile please üò¨
awe let him in meanie üëπ thank you this really brightened my day but let him in
adorable hey op i noticed his her chin looks dirty my baby girl evie gets that it‚Äôs similar to acne and it‚Äôs sometimes caused by plastic food and water dishes because they can harbor bacteria they say the best thing to do is use metal you‚Äôre supposed to clean it off too i get a nail brush and brush under her chin it gets the stuff off and she‚Äôs in heaven because she thinks she‚Äôs being pampered i also noticed that for my evie it helped her tremendously to switch foods on her seems as if she was allergic to what i gave her
i m deceased this is hilarious thank you for the laugh
i was like what the heck am i looking at it s like crossing dimensions now ohhh
i hope these videos become common i love watching these cats get caught
at first i thought this was a top down view thought the fucking uprising had begun
furry stalker conjured up a very different image in my head
does no one else s cat reach their paw under the door and shake the whole ass door when they want in no just the big farm cat we adopted ok
i literally thought you were doing the stranger things thing
i thought this was gonna be something completely different
does anyone have a link to the similar video from a few days ago
very clever angle and use of device adorable domino
get a metal food water bowl instead of plastic and it ll help get rid of the kettahs chin pimples i had a similar thing with my boy and switching made em go away in a week
i read this out loud and now my family won‚Äôt talk to me
that s much pretty and cool it doesn t work like a fool
ok i think i see him oh shit i have been spotted abort mission i repeat abort mission
lord how big is the gap under youse people s doors such that you can stick your whole head under like that
i read this wrong and was confused when you were not in fact being stalked by someone in a fursuit
what the hell is thi oh no crap crap crap uhhh mooom i just came here to tell you i love you i don t want any catnip i just want to remind you
it s somewhat reassuring to know cats are only assholes when they are a aware they have an audience this is the sweetest thing ever
a video with the same title could ve been terrifying
definitely had a different idea in my head when i read ‚Äúfurry stalker‚Äù hahahaha
when i saw the words furry stalker i thought you meant something else then i read the subreddit and then saw the cat i was relieved
my cat has figured out how to jump and open the door via door handle scariest part of my life when she does it at night lol
this is probably the greatest video i have ever seen
ahhhh let him in you monster lt so cute my cat does that too every now and then i ll just hear a little tap at whatever door is closed i open it unless she s pissed me off or i m trying to sleep lol amp x b also we have those glass patio doors and sometimes when she wants to come in usually if it s just started raining she ll just sit there and scratch at the door but since it s glass it s literally just her slapping the door and staring into our souls with that whole puss in boots sad kitty expression melts my heart i m a sucker for my baby girl tbh she could lay down on my lap and puke on me and i d potentially still just sit there and pet her amp x b okay probably not that much of a sucker but you get the gist of it
wendy you have a big surprise coming to you go check out the snow cat and the radio and you ll see what i mean go check it out ha ha ha go check it out
if i did that with my cat my phone would be scratched beyond repair gorilla glass wouldn t do shit
why do doors in us have such massive gaps under them
those asymmetrical face tuxedos love hoomins i was babysitting my daughter s friend s cats supposed to be for weeks going into the fifth month and the male tux won t leave me alone at least the friend is helping with the food amp litter bill
these are making me smile so big i love both of these and now want to make one of my cats lol
it looks like the cat realized what happened and stopped the video himself
that last move made it look like she stopped the video
the little noises of the cats mouth are too adorable
geez poor cat that s torture let the poor bugger in
that kitty just wants to protect you while you re pooping
wait so the gap below your door is big enough to fit your phone through it shouldn t that gap be only a few milimeters wide
whoahhh trippy it s weird that i associate vision with my whole body and large head etc and this therefore feels impossible kudos
can someone make a mobile friendly gif for me of the cat looking straight then down at the camera ending as after it stares into it please
whoa you all need to chill it‚Äôs just a cat inside a house can we just enjoy life these days
did he give a shit you caught him no he stays unbothered
wendy baby i think you hurt my head real bad i‚Äôm dizzy i need a doctor honey don‚Äôt leave me in here
what are you doing hooman oh catnip it s a camera play it cool like nothing happened
brian what the fuck bro stop playing games and let me in you know how much i hate closed doors
and here i was thinking you were being stalked by an actual furry
every breath you take every move you make every bond you brake every bond you break ill be watching you
hahaha i m going to have to do this with my cat now
that experimental door sniff push combo gets me every time
well if thats not a future branch manager i dont know what it
i was upvote number this is the best day of my life
if you cover the left side of the stick with your finger it looks like the pups got a blunt in his mouth
we are so so lucky to share the planet with fur babies
wish there was a way to stop them from growing past that stage it s almost dammit i want a perma puppy already
so what s with dogs and their sticks i mean does it mean something in the sense of evolution
i like how all three of them put their hand up in sync
there s no rule that says a dog can t play basketball
gotta love how doge bryant is hyped after that three pointer
that dude looks like starlord and alliser thorne at the same time
i just love how their noses and mouths kinda blend in so they look like cute fuzzy deformed soot sprites i ll take please amp x b also congrats i hope you all get tons of love from your new pet relationship and they love you forever and you love them as well
there is double trouble of the best kind they are precious happy gotcha day kitties welcome to your forever home
siamese are the best cats ever you are going to be so happy with them
we start fires d just comes into my mind by them looking into the camera
i was not prepared for how cute this is he s so tiny safe travels little dude
i thought dik diks were cute pudu deer are even cuter
oh my god i bet those lil hooves make the tiniest tip taps d
my greyhound did this all of the time rest his soul üíôüåà
i love it when they slam their head on you like this it s such a sweet expression of love and trust
no matter how many times i see this i will always love it
i have never had a dog that did this sort of a head trust fall very cute
the dog can talk but can t pronounce the u in human why is this a thing
if this didn t make you smile at least a little then idk
my pound chihuahua jrt mix does the same thing when she wants pets and attention will plop her head down like that and then stare at you if you don‚Äôt respond for a few seconds rinse and repeat till she gets her pets
i have a mini schnauzer that does that head flop thing only very occasionally it melts my heart i feel like it‚Äôs the equivalent of a doggy hug
this one makes me miss my dog that died years ago give him an extra love for me please
the ones on the left look like they just back from a night of clubbing
finally figured out the whole bird and the bees thing excuse me have to go wash my hands
i m sure vanessa from the bee movie would love this
reminds me of when winnie the pooh got stuck leaving rabbits house
for some reason this is so comical to me it looks as if all of them just fell headfirst into flowers and are now stuck inside üòÇ
we have now brought pedophiles to a whole new level
this is the cutest picture i didn‚Äôt know i needed to see
i always imagine bumblebees sounding like paula deen explaining to everyone why that‚Äôs their favorite flower as they float by it
this is awesome we used to hate bees until their numbers dropped now we re making them cute
gimme dat bumble butt and them little legs i aint too hard to beg
for fuck sakes they‚Äôre just just fat sloppy drunks that‚Äôs half of boston what is my sister so afraid of
i have a phobia of bees and pics like this are helping me to see them as tiny little teddy bears with wings they just want that honey still afraid of wasps though
reminds me of the bird in the chocolate the bees saying oh laawdie
i‚Äôm legit going to have to get this framed and put in my kitchen
my daughter had a dangerous obsession with bees when she was little she would stalk them in the garden and repeatedly ask if she could pet them üòÖ
lots of questions when i see that karma how why when where what but do i ask them no i just stare at them b‚Äôs
huh didn‚Äôt know we were posting pictures of ed kemper on this sub
precious overload i ve never seen such a great pic as this so good
i didn t know i needed to see this but shit i really did adorable
well they re all fat but at least a couple of them bleached down there üòÅ
upper left is like take me so damn cute it s like a mini hopeless romantic
where are their stingers looks like one has a stinger maybe but i cant see the others
this is hilarious i especially enjoyed the dirty one covered in pollen lol
i m afraid it s not looking good i m giving you a day at most this may be the last time i see you you ll surely be adopted right away your check up is good though have a treat
the results are in and i m really sorry to say but you re a pupper
plot twist the vet is ‚Äô tall and the dog is ten years old
omg how can you sit there and take pictures instead of snatching him up and keeping him safe in your chin pocket
this is the look i give the phlebotomist when they re coming at me
little viszlas always seem to look so worried such good dogs
the bond between a grammy and her grandpuppy cannot be broken
grammy knows gus means well but gus only knows gus things be the bestest gus
something about dogs and grandparents they always know they can get extra love and a few extra treats
he has the same expression my nephew did with his gran mom says it s bedtime gran says oh a few more minutes won t hurt mom says no more cookies gran sneaks him one
read this at first as my baby says grammy and i fully expected to watch the dog talk but this is even cuter
i grew up with four sets of grandparents and lost them all by the time i was please everyone reading this cherish every moment because there is an expiry on these beautiful people
i m in public right now but inside i m screaming like a yr old ine direction fan meting one directors for the first time it s so cute i need more
is he full rottweiler i see on some of your other posts gus still has his tail i didn‚Äôt know rotties have a bushy tail
my family‚Äôs lab use to love my grandpa he use to take her to school every friday and said lab figured out what day he came and which car was his every friday as soon as his car pulled around the block she‚Äôd start running around the house with excitement till grandpa scratched her hears
sitting on a couch not having to work to drink in hand loyal buddy by my side how soon can i get to this stage of my life
thank you for sharing this beautiful relationship they both have great smiles too
gus is such a good boy he clearly loves hanging out with grandma
my friends rotty would watch guard over my daughter everytime we went over their house when she was a baby sadie the rotty would sit next next to my daughters carrier and not leave her side she never got aggressive but if anyone went to hold my daughter sadie would follow that person the entire time she was a great dog
omg i ve never seen a cat do that before what a good kitty
waiting for the reddit veterinary surgeon to explain that the cat has myxomatosis or something
the pure agility and dexterity to go from laying down in a ball to back flipping is just ridiculous
mine did this when she had fleas it was her getting bit and trying to run from them
this is so freaking awesome and really reminds me of how my kitty used to pull similar stunts all nonchalantly then pretend to be all regal and go about her day calmly for a bit
my cat used to do wall runs and attack but this is impressive
i love your possessed cat i wanna pet the absolute heck outta this cute kitty
i love how you can tell the person recording is laughing because of the phone shaking
i mean if you could do that so easily wouldn t you i would
it‚Äôs just to rub it in ur face that he‚Äôs way cooler than u or really anyone
your cat is just a high school student entering a deep sleep oh my god i completely forgot about homework backflips into consciousness
maybe it‚Äôs farting i had a dog that would fart and run away from it spooky poots
this is going to the front page like a flying backflip from a tail touching squat
clearly wasn t laying down was sat with front paws between back paws looking at the end of it s tail then it patted it with it s paw and made it s self jump and resulting in a backflip
i wonder if she s waking up from a dream where she s falling
is that a hitbox what is this fighting game i wanna play
thanks for the green square i might have missed it otherwise
that‚Äôs the ‚Äúi‚Äôve been sitting in this house too long with no catnip karen‚Äù
those green squares drawn over the cat how did they get there
does anyone else see a translucent cat walking into frame on the left before the gif cuts
i love to imagine the security cam is just to record these flips lol
do you have those automatic air fresheners that make the loud noises before they spray
okay just run video in your home please and find us all the good clips of your cat being outrageous
so does my friend if i could spontaneously backflip i probably would too
what is that green box a targeting reticle did he get zapped
wish i had that kind of energy when i get out of bed
i watched this three times trying to figure out which sims game you‚Äôre playing
i mean if i could do a backflip that effortlessly i‚Äôd probably do a lot more backflips too
when stuff like this happens on camera i realy wonder what amazing things happens off camera
i think that only happens when your house is haunted
the weirdest thing about this was that when we saw this happen out of the corner of our eyes we went to the security app to watch it literally right before the flip the app cuts ahead seconds and no matter how many times we tried it wouldn‚Äôt play on the app all other footage played back fine but not this spooky
what kind of cat is this i‚Äôm taking care of a feral cat who looks quite a lot like this cat i can‚Äôt tell if he‚Äôs a maine coon cat or norwegian forest cat or not any kind of breed at all yet manages to look like many other cats enough they could get together and declare themselves a breed
stop lying you just don t want us to know about your magical flying cat ‡≠ß ‚Ä¢ÃÄ·óù‚Ä¢ÃÅ‡πë ‡´≠
mine has no problem with the sun roof but will not stop on the clear washing machine lid cats are weird man
something about the face makes that cat look really friendly
he s winking i grew up with a jack russel he was the litter mate of wish bone ziggy always looked like he was smiling
jack russells are my favorite breed yours looks so happy
what a good boy jack russells always seem so bright and full of energy
have a nice day is a weird name but he looks like a goodboy
get him an eye patch like that doggo from tales of the gold monkey
a one eyed jack very clever he must be a card shark cute happy boy
perfect opportunity to name him willie every girl id bring over i d be like wanna see my one eyed willie when they give that grotesque look of disapproval i d open the door to a dog with one eye just as excited as ever to see me this is my furry friend willie
should gorilla glue one googly eye as a replacement it make the dog look hilarious
cute pup i must confess i ve just made the mistake of showing your picture to my other half after spending the past few evenings looking for another dog to adopt she wanted to adopt straight away when can we come round to collect
has he always only had one eye or did he lose it later on i m asking because my dog was born without tear ducts in one of her eyes the rescue we got her from thought it was some sort of injury so it took a while to figure out what the real issue was the dog opthomologist has us on a regiment of eye drops trying to stave off eye removal since she still has some sight in it but she absolutely hates the drops so i am seriously considering having them just remove the eye does he seem to struggle at all
thank you so much for sharing your pupper he truly made my day üêæ üíï üêæ hugs from me and sniffs from my husky joseph
how did it lose its eye my parents have a jack russell and it‚Äôs scrappy as hell lol great dogs
good pup i demand you give him all the hugs and as many pets as his heart desires
i bet the one eye doesn t slow him down at all unlimited energy in these guys
one eye jack i always thought he was an ol wives tale he s real
please tell me the adorable pupper has a pirate name
that‚Äôs one l of a jack russell tell him people if reddit think he‚Äôs a good boy
so cute makes me think of a dog i used to have her name was chloie she had one eye she died on she was a rescue she was so sweet
it would be so hard for me not to name re name a one eyed dog winky
my cousin has a one eyed jack russell as well still a good boi
i i want to put a goggly eye on the left side but i feel like that‚Äôll be rude
thought you d named the jack russel jack russel and i just thought hey that actually fits cutie
please tell me he has been a pirate for halloween at least once
that curl cowlick on the chest is on every jack i have ever seen including our
you re a one eyed jack around here dad i seen the other side of your face marlin brando as kid rio one eyed jacks
please tell me i m not the only one disgusted by this
what a sweet precious baby there is no love in this world like the love from a jack russell
is this something they‚Äôre born with or does it occur because of something i don‚Äôt have much knowledge about dogs
give him hugs at least hugs from me such a good boy
the peak of human creation the newly bred jack sparrow terrier
so cute but get him a eyepatch then he will be dapper and cute
this photo made me cry honestly i have a jack russell and beagle mix called bella and i love her so much their smiles are exactly the same ‚ù§Ô∏è
my friend had a dog that literally looked just like this one his name was pirate
i have a one eyed cat named marshmallow nice to see everyone appreciates pets like ours
need some feedback from a pet owner who has a pet that‚Äôs missing one or both eyes personally i think they‚Äôre adorable and compensate in awesome ways my concern about owning one comes from the fear of accidentally jabbing em in the socket if they‚Äôre sprinting jumping for attention or otherwise manage to position their head in the line of fire is that something to worry about i gotta settle my heebie jeebies about it
finally i see some jack russels in reddit i have one too
this made me smile thank you my dog lost her eye last week and it‚Äôs been a little rough
with a smile like that it looks like he is winking ive got the sensation that today is gonna be an alright day i guess it is time to get out of bed
i had a jack russell that looked just like that she passed away last week rip daisy
thanks for this my dog just got done having her eye removed seeing this lets me know that everything is going to be ok
i love jack russells i have a jack russel and i love him so much
you need more love not saying you dont have lots of it but still you need more lots and lots and lots of love
now i absolutely have to see a video of him playing catch
he has one eye which means he can now focus all the love rays into one concentrated laser beam
how is the weird goose so chill about this situation
since no one else mentioned it if you are curious the weird looking duck is a muscovy they get pretty big for a duck
thought that read danger doodle i was shocked for like second when it moved
if you snoop you‚Äôll get a boop noodle on citrus patrol
red to yellow kill a fellow red to black friend to jack
this might be a stupid as fuck question but is that snake related to cobras at all
looks like a dark souls boss mytha missstressss of mandarins haha
this isn t cute he s terrified this poster is an asshole
this is exploitation of a terrified animal you suck
this animal is clearly defensive you don t need to be a zoologist to see this this is wrong
not for nothing do animals seem better than people in so many ways
this is heartbreaking zoos and circuses shouldn t be a thing anymore just let them live their natural lives for fucks sake
in years we ll see killing other animals the way we see slavery today
so many people on this world just don‚Äôt get that there are a lot of life forms on this planet that are capable of expressing true feelings towards not only each other but to other species also the sooner the rest of the idiots get this concept the better the planet will be for all of us
plot twist these animals never knew each other but what he s doing to her nipples feels sooooooo good
they feel like us they bond like us they care for their young like us we need to give them the respect they deserve
stop holding elephants captive devote your last years with trying to protect them
imagine you being reunited with your friend after you both were kidnapped for years thats what i see here
i can t deal with those wiggles don t even know what sound i made it was so high pitched
aww little guy‚Äôs stretching out those nerves to neuron connections
tail twitch and butt wiggles are even more adorable at this size
see how the fierce felis adorablis effortfully stalks his prey watch as his tentative big kitty steps bring him ever closer to his unknowing prey once in position our fearless hunter prepares for a killing strike by preforming the infamous booty wiggle shhh shh wait for it and he s done it our boy has successfully incapacitated his target with awwwwws
‚Äúrawr human will get sneakysnuggles hahahah i sneakysnuggle u ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äú
i love hows hes trying to take the longest steps possible üòÇ
such a cute kitty try not to use your hand to play though and use toys instead that is unless you want big kitty with larger teeth and murder mittens to be attacking your hands for the next twenty years
ohhhhhhhssshhhhhittttttt that little booty wiggle is contagious
i‚Äôm still in disbelief how something so cute can exist in this world
hey i don t want you to fall in the same trap i did avoid the hand play when they are young i made that mistake and it took a long time to get a particular cat of mine to stop biting attacking my hand
it s kind of crazy how they do this out of pure instinct nobody taught this kitten to approach the prey slowly and pounce
when i was really small we got a kitten she used to wiggle her way around like that and everyone found it adorable as they should however at the dinner table occasionally someone would cry out in pain it was that cute wobbly little assassin climbing up the cliffs that were our legs she‚Äôs almost twenty now and still healthy as ever love that cat
oooh little paws little wiggle so much cute i can‚Äôt
these raw ‚Äúcircle of life‚Äù nature films of apex predators are brutal yet i can‚Äôt look away
dude mark this as nsfw it got pretty gory at the end s
my cat is ¬Ω but still does this except leaps further and looks like a pillow bcoz she s fat
cute but it s not a great idea to teach them that hands are toys
that pre pounce wiggle is so fucking cute like literally it‚Äôs so fluffy i‚Äôm gonna die moment they‚Äôre like springs lmao
drax s voice you can t see me i ve learned to move so slowly i m totally invisible
i was going to comment ‚Äúbutt wiggle ‚Äù but the noticed that was already every other comment i am not special
the hunter stalks it‚Äôs prey then jumps at it with power and elagance
i love seeing kittens very first stalking behaviors so cute
cats wiggling their butts before they pounce is everything
what kind of cat is this he she looks sort of like mine that was abandoned by a feral mama for the cat tax look at my most recent cat post and also probably in the comments
so assuming that guy is dead then did the cat upload the video
me trying to sneak downstairs for a glass of water at am
this is third or fourth time i‚Äôve seen this hit the front page and i‚Äôll upvote it every time because it‚Äôs just so adorable
this has been a successful execution of wigglebutt exe
he so brave that little butt wiggle slew me and tail
this cat is moving so incredibly slowly i can barely notice it
the butt wiggle made me teary eyed it was so fucking cute i can t
love when they do that butt rotation thing like they re winding themselves up
door slams open and kitten s head gets squished to pieces
is that wiggle butt learned or instinct what purpose does it serve
young predators are wobbly and they like to walk like slinkies
getting low as possible to avoid breaking stealth check slowly approach target so as not to alert it check pre pounce butt wiggle check this kitty is a go in my book
i don t expect meow from the cat but roar like a lion
i feel like if more people do this it would raise the self esteem of the cat knowing they were quiet and being a fierce predator cats like being predators and stuff but idk i m only and have no clue where i m going with this
we had a cat that looked just like her her name was molli
why is she outside please keep her inside she s a lovie
darla it means little darling in old english i have a similar looking cat she was so sweet and cuddly so we called her darla
dip she looks like she‚Äôs been dipped in white chocolate
that‚Äôs a big piggie i can hear the weeking from here what a sweet one
you are certainly loved and trusted regardless of regular handling i always found guippies to be a little on the skittish side makes sense given they are naturally prey to just about every carnivore in their range this little one though looks like it s just found it s favourite seat
had a couple lb piggies when i was growing up but i dont think they were ever a big as this one
soooo cute makes me miss my little piggies all over again grew up with several piggies but had to give my last years ago to a good family friend since i didn t have the time to give them the love and attention they needed while studying and working my oldest piggie sunny always scrambled to be up under my chin or perched on my shoulder either facing forward or with her head tucked under my hair when i picked her up she lived to be nearly yo blind as a bat but still loud with her demands for thistles and cuddles as soon as she heard me
based on that smile it s actually you who is blessed to have that chunky boy
he‚Äôs adorable chunk is the perfect name i was given my first pig by an ex and then got three more over the course of a few years they all looked cute and needed love gotta love em
thats one big üêñ he s bigger than both of tue pigs i had as a kid combined
oh good god i can t think of a better possible train ride
dogs i have no idea what i‚Äôm doing but i‚Äôm happy to be involved
tell me in what magical fantastical world does this exist
half of these are samoyads source owned samoyad for years
oh my god this looks like heaven how does one book a seat ill have one seat for me and one seat for my husky please
the second to last dog on the left is not a husky still looked happy to be there am husky look at my floof
hours in and the huskies have no idea i‚Äôve infiltrated their bus i will be sending back more info on how to survive the cold once i collect more data signed the poodle from the back of the bus
the one guy with the stuffed animal acting like nobody will notice is awesome
good to see moon moon alive and well third from the back
i would pet so many dogs this train ride is two days still not enough time to pet dogs
i can sense the built up zoomies that will ensue once the bus lets them off
"why is there no audio i need to listen to this omg i want audio find me some audio aaahh
i need to hear the puppy love"
that last dog on the right does a seriously fancy ‚Äòblue steel ‚Äô
‚Äútoo miny hoomins u cn nevr hav to mny flufy bois only too many hoomins‚Äù every dog ever
that one bichon in the back just like ‚Äúuh yes am too a husky‚Äù
this entire thing is gold but i especially love the one with the captain america shield trying to nom his handler s wrist
this is what i‚Äôll show people if they ask what my personal heaven would be
i this isn t what they mean when they say dog training is it
super dog back there has clark kent levels of blending in with the huskies and malamutes
i dont know what it is but there is something disturbing about this
smiling on a dog means they are stress and this fact makes this video very sad
fuck off jenna nobody said you could bring a bichon on the bus
agent bichon frise has infiltrated the husky syndicate
is it bad that this made me cry this video exudes such peacefulness
bad luck brian gets chihuahuas that aggressively tear at his ankles
"‚ô´ samoyed s to the left of me husky s to the right ‚ô´
‚ô´ here i am stuck in the middle with you ‚ô´"
walking onto that train would be the happiest day of my life
the bichon needed a lift and just happened to be hitching their way
well this is the cutest harlem shake i ve ever seen
the one guy no one invited sitting in the back trying to blend in
think about the deafening awoo that s about to happen
it s impressive that they got so many huskies that close together without a fight breaking out
i have the wrong job i need to work for this transportation company
i hope this is the train i board when i go into the afterlife
as someone who wants a husky in the future this is adorable
haha stupid little white dog at almost the back thinks it s a husky
anyone else see the non husky he‚Äôs welcome here too
free unintentional complimentary sweaters with every trip
holy fuck that‚Äôs literally heaven imagine all that dog hair getting on you tho
i thought the pups were actually waving until i realized that the dogs were being controlled by the people
there‚Äôs one somewhere near the middle on the right who‚Äôs owner doesn‚Äôt seem to have the right idea of movement poor guy is so fucking confused
this needed to be with sound i wanted to know what they were talking about too cute
the ac must be cranked that bichon is gonna be demanding blankets soon enough lol
i see that white ones are on one side and the black ones are on the other
i can t imagine the amount hair left over on that bus
willing to bet every one of those people refer to their dog as a fur baby
love the second to left dog just biting the shit out of the owners hand no idea how they re all just ok with being shook like that doggy xanax i guess
the one towards the end on the left side that is on his side is having the best of times
captain america in the second row on the left still fighting for everyone s freedom after they ve given up and accepted this life of obedience
one side is almost exclusively huskies and the other side has american eskimos or samoyeds but they look smaller than that plus a random maltese thrown in the back
thats like the walk to the cell youl see on tv all the time except in awesome
the one in the second seat of the left row is like ‚Äúnah bruh‚Äù
i m browsing while watching chernobyl on hbo just got to the scene with puppies from last nights episode as i got to this post good timing neutralized the pain
i like the th one on the right the all white one head banging
was thinking something totally different by the word husky
why they segregating the bus forcing the mixed floofs to one side
okay am i the only one questioning wth they are doing to those dogs and why some clearly are annoyed with being handled that way
the one on the left hand side with the head down is not having a good day lol
with a li l bichon bolognese maltese i don t know exactly in the back
my favorite is the one n the left hanging sideways what a perfect goober
watching this legitimately makes me angry that i cannot be there
i adopted a dog that is being transported from texas to nyc tomorrow and this is exactly how i envision his ride going down
my parents have two huskies they like to sleep in snow banks and getting covered in mud is this what clean puppers look like
then my bulldog comes on the bus and hushed whispers erupt throughout
seconds in i l can clearly see a bichon to the left now my whole life is a lie if this dog can get in with the huskys i can do it
that one at seconds on the right just shaking up and down
huskies on the right samoyeds on the left i have a samoyed love them
captain america doggo at the beginning on the left was not having it
haha alot of friends so where are we going one dog thinking
adorable until you wonder what if they all start talking at once
where are you i‚Äôm moving tomorrow i need the location asap soldier
i love the ones with the mask around their eyes they either look super derpy or up to something super mischievous
the poodle at the end trying to play it cool and look natural
anyone else worried before the image loaded it was a train of husky people having sex
my allergies would cause this to be my last ever train ride
i am seeing a lot of great samoyeds maybe more than huskies
mile they still have no idea i m not a husky my superdog outfit came with camouflage powers
i really needed this after that last episode of chernobyl
"when i read the title i thought it was gonna be like
those human trains where one guy follows the other definitely wasn t disappointed"
hmm looks like korea to me but without audio i can t be sure korean express buses look just like that
the fun really starts when the bus breaks down and the huskies pull them back to circle k
b c it‚Äôs cold i‚Äôm hungry and those humans have a fire i‚Äôll come by to warm up
we could probably turn and eat all these humans right now ruff
that one husky on the left legit wasnt having it lol
that s cute but think what would happen if they got angry
the one hanging sideways on the left near the end gets me every time
it surprises me that no one has commented about the dogs eating
this is one of the greatest dog gifs i ve ever seen
i think someone on that train doesn t know their husky from their poodle perhaps the poodle got let on the train by wearing a husky costume
this reminds me of the kazoo kids for some reason they got that whole silly shake going on
one of these things is not like the others one of these things just doesn t belong
then there is just the one tiny dog going incognito
the first guy just get bite by it dog i don‚Äôt play i was once a wolf
i was having such a bad day today and this really made me feel better thanks
don t fat shame the train its okay if it s a bit husky its still beautiful
why are they all collected together off to a slaughter house
where may i buy a ticket i‚Äôm a little bit of a husky fella myself
they are on their way to walk on two legs camp asia has some weird fetish with making dogs do human shit
the one at the front biting it s owners hand was hilarious and cute
the doggo in the superman outfit is a non husky infiltrator not saying it s bad just an observation
the is the walk you take before you get into heaven
i saw the words husky train and thought i had accidentally gone into a nsfw subreddit very relieved to see it was just a bunch of huskies dogging
i immediately smiled but loved the bichon toward the end sidled into the club with his buddies or they let him in the side door
second to last dog on the left i think i‚Äôm on the wrong bus
this is my favorite thing please people do more of these
i m assuming they aren t all amazingly trained dogs
you could power the world if you harnessed that energy
don‚Äôt you mean ‚Äútrain to heaven‚Äù because that‚Äôs what this looks like to me
just imagine they re all panting in unison and it sounds like a steam locomotive wufawufawufawufawufa owoooooo
i can t wait for tony baker to do something with this üôèüôè
i was expecting there to be poodle at the corner of the last row
oh my gawd husky heaven we love dogs here at the office it makes the day go well
i watched this while the game of thrones intro was on surprisingly it worked well the last row actually felt like the iron throne
god have mercy on the poor soul that vacuums that train
is no one else weirded out by the way everyone is forcefully moving the dogs arms around that s not cute at all just fuckin weird like people who talk for babies
husky train lt i think i wanna go ride to it giggles
how could you not upvote this it‚Äôs what the internet is all about
if only i could upvote more my heart is bursting with cuteness overload
just signed up on reddit and this is the first thing i see this internet thing is pretty cool man üòé
that one guy carrying the dog like a baby didnt get the memo
look at all dem happy floofy puppers it makes me happy to see them happy
i really dislike how they are grabbing them and moving their arms they are dogs not dolls
all of my childhood jeans lined up in a row also a husky train
i‚Äôve had two huskies i know first hand how crazy they are and this train looks like a fucking insane asylum lol
it would take me hours to get to the back of the bus because i d be petting all those floofs
way to assume the dogs view on life he might be a fire truck
the poodle in the back ‚Äúday the hoomans still don‚Äôt suspect a thing‚Äù
the gates of doghala where the mightiest warriors welcome a new addition to their pack
some poor soul is going to spend hours vacuuming that bus
they ll never get all the hair out of there no matter how long they try
the huskies on the bus go awwwwwwoh ooawwhhh awwwwhhhh arooooooooooooow
i‚Äôm just saying if they‚Äôre that excited over something next is the piss fest
everyone is pointing out that one of the huskies is a bichon so i ll point out that the train is a bus
i wish people wouldn t do that thing where they wave their pet s paws i don t know if the pet minds it or not but it looks demeaning
my heart literally feels like it will explode with joy jsjsjsnsnn
that bichon wearing sock and flapping its paws is killing me üòÇ
the left hand side are samoyeds look at them like angels
only a bichon would be able to angle itself onto that busüòÇ
what the fuck kind of adorable and weird did i just watch
god this made me so happy i m doing finals rn thank
i have a husky sheppard they fart alot amp x b that was the smelliest bus in the world that day
one of the dogs looked like a stuff animal at first glace he was on the right side in the middle getting his ears rubbed had to watch again to make sure xd
my allergies would probably kill me before i made it to the back
this video broke me i have never cringed at a video on reddit but i just fetal position over how cute this
this gif almost gave me a heart attack from husky overload i love it
i would be in the back middle seat hysterically crying from the cuteness overload
i imagined the harlem shake playing in the background to this
and y all say us white people do crazy shit that makes no sense
poodle day they still have no clue i am not a husky will continue surveillance
cute but hate how many of them are holding and swinging them by their arms
‚Äúif i hold my pupper‚Äôs paws and bounce them up and down they get cuter ‚Äù every person on this train
did i just see a random bichon frise sitting in the back on the left lol
come on ride with huskies hey ride it come on ride with huskies hey ride it come on ride with huskies hey ride it
in reality i‚Äôm sure this would be an atrocious experience but look at all those boops
that s the cuddliest way to travel that i ve ever seen
i m on mobile the gif load slow expecting human centipede kinda stuff gif loaded train full of fluffy husky i am happy
where is this magical bus and what time does it depart
i like the one biting at its owner who is shaking him and then the one killed over in back
this train could be going to hell i‚Äôd still wanna ride
them dogs are bein taken down to paradise city where the grass is green and the smells are perty
thanks for making me smile really need these kind of things right now
i always get the feeling that japan has been trolling the entire world for thousands of years
i‚Äôve literally never wanted to be somewhere more in my life seriously screw going on vacation i would rather be here
the ninth dogo on the left is trying to act dead to get away from this horror
the one in the fourth chair from the last on the left üòÇ
i love how every single one of them looks so happy to be there all aboard the moon moon express
i thought this was something completely different from the title
my friends wants details on how he can get on this bus any help with that
not just huskies but sammies and toy american eskimos too
i pressed the upvote button twice because i liked this post so much it removed the upvote help
girls locker room poodles guys locker room husky train
am i the only one who s gonna mention that that s a coach not a train amp x b i m fun at parties
oh my god is this actually a video sent down from heaven look at them all look at all those floofy happy boyes eeee üòçüòç
when you it s the first day of school and you realize you got on the wrong school bus
i‚Äôm saving this so whenever i‚Äôm having a bad moment i can watch this video and have a good one
i so wanna start a howl and see what will happen next
i hate that some owners took their paws and like wawing with them
i wonder what going on inside there head doggo s what dafaq be this meat bag doing to me
there s an imposter on the left hand side right befire the end but never has there been a more positive case of that ever haha
they got it wrong there is no stairway to heaven you take the bus this bus
plot twist this is filmed in china and they‚Äôre on their way to a food festival
i m sad cause no one commented on the facts that half of the bus is actually samoyed and that the combination of the doggos is greater then both types separately
no really husky train there are more samoyeds and what s that last one a bichon frise
oh my fucking goodness i really want to be on that train at first i thought it may be two three huskies running together but this is the best thing in the internet for may
i love dogs but i don‚Äôt want to be the man who has to vacuum clean the bus after this i bet you can knit a room sized carpet with the leftover fur
if this is heaven you just gave me another reason to kill myself
i need a skateboard so i can pet all the dogs as quickly as possible
it s like the last scene in titanic where the camera just pans through the lined up crowd of dead people and i m in heaven
no one seems to be noticing but the th husky on the right is not liking this at all the owner seems to be swinging it in a way it would hurt the husky
imagine being me and getting totally wigged out because you watched this not realizing it s people making the dogs way their paws
nd last dog on the left day the humans still don t know i m not a husky
one well placed howl there and you d have windows breaking
i dont know where this bus is going but i want to get on that bus
ofcourse theres this one rebel the guy who brought his podell probly thinks hes edgy
no sound but this is the loudest video i ve seen recently
i love how only like three or four of them had the actual serious husky face and the rest were just doggos
one of them is not like the others its okay because the whole thing is completely adorable
calls bank me yes hi i want to sell all my stuff and use the money to go where this photo was taken
i feel bad for the person who has to clean the bus afterwards all that shedding
bichon frise day and they still think i m a husky just a really really tiny curly one
next stop heaven amp x b oh wait i m already there üêæ
no one gonna talk about the only poodle in that train
this horrified me solely based on the odd human behavior of shaking their dogs
this needs the vengaboys ‚Äòwe like to party‚Äô playing over this
awww its sooo adorable that i could kill myself to keep them alive
should i ask why so many husky s are on one train together
that one bichon frise lol i have one too his name is jackson and his cuteness kills
samoyeds on the left huskys on the right this must have been planned
i need to know the location of this train right now
is this heaven i really regret not believing in it but this is all the proof i need
how much money do i have to pay to get on this train
where is the audio i will legitimately pay for the audio
i see a mashup opportunity here kang am style and who let the dogs out
i don t need anymore internet today this is a perfect place to stay for the remaining hours and minutes
bassets are the best i had my girl for years and i miss her so much give this little one an extra hug for me please
i‚Äôve never owned a basset but they always look so precious i love the eeyore look
imagine a person made you look like that for money and as a bonus you were in constant pain
this dog looks years old and months old at the same time cute puppy
no other breed has more compelling eyes they actually get worse as the dog grows up
will pet and call good boy tons of times until happy
‚Äúyou‚Äôre laughing but you wish you could be up here as well‚Äù cat probably
cat has apparently found the cat trap you ll have to help him down because he hasn t found the cat escape yet
this reminds me of the cages the witches from hocus pocus put the rebellious teenagers in
i mma down vote it so someone else could put it back into up vote if its fine by youüôÇ
spider cat spider cat can do whatever a spider cat does
always looking for new and better ways to show you his butthole
let me just put this out there that this isn‚Äôt my cat lol mine is grey i just saw this on instagram
i must be the only person on reddit that finds cat sized dogs repulsive
omg that‚Äôs adorable i would pay to have a dinner date with him
so adorable i love miniature food and hamsters are so very cute this little guy is sitting there eating his dinner not just stuffing his cheeks with it he actually understands dinner date
i was prepared to watch him drink from the little cup but much more manners than my bf at the table lol
love that the ham gets their own chair and everything
it took me a second to realize you made him his own dinnerset
i once was asked to hamster sit a hamster for a girl at work for two weeks i totally could have done cute stuff like this but instead i made his cage the reichstag complete with banners and made videos of him eating while playing a hitler speech
for some reason i thought you were going to feed your piece of broccoli which also made it look like you were going to eject it off the end of your fork and mach at your date
wonder how you got a hampster to sit still that long
cute why the hell does that person need two plates though
this is the best date ever so cute i love how serious hamsters look when they are chowing down
i don‚Äôt know how i don‚Äôt know why but i can sense the bond between you two and it is beautiful
i love how he brought his wee friend with him as well
if i were greeted like this everyday of my life i‚Äôd actually be excited to get out of my bed and leave home just to come back to this cutie patotie
looks like that something better came along for rowlf after all
i ran the clip through a canine translator app op is correct the dog clearly verbalized the command to get belly rubs
your dog and my dog though vastly different breeds seem to have come from the same litter üòÇ he‚Äôs got the same butt wagging mania even if you‚Äôve just gone to the bathroom
so cute you can tell how much they love their human such a good dog
i ve said it before and i ll say it again there isn t one person in your life not your wife your husband your kid your mom who is always happy to see you when you walk in the door doesn t matter whether you ve been gone minutes hours or months your dog is always stoked when you get home we don t deserve them
my dog throws herself on her back after running a few laps to me and around the coffee table in my living room to pee all over herself i love her üòÇ
why would you stop the video right when the belly rubbing part starts
ugh i want a dog so bad and this just makes the puppy fever worse i am lucky enough to have cats that greet me and show a lot of affection though
dog it s been ten long years human it was a minute grocery trip
is the dog wagging the tail or is the tail wagging the dog i guess we ll never know
you know a dog s happy when it s wagging its whole butt instead of just its tail
that wag is so powerful it washes away all the sadness
being welcomed home by your pets is the best this little guy and the butt wiggle is so adorable
lol a lot of dogs at the kennel i work at will do this because they know it‚Äôs harder for me to pick them up or put a leash on them
i felt the power of that tail wag through the phone
i wish someone something would wiggle like that when i get back home
i want to play and i want tummy rubs and i want to see you and i love you and so many happy smells and and and too many feelings i fall over now
the only one who would be glad to see me at home is this dog
that is the waggiest wag i have ever seen in my life omg
now whenever i m feeling down i m going to look at this dog and see how happy they are literally just is a big bundle of love it makes me so happy
i frequently get a getting like this it s the best thing in the world especially after a rough day at work
just wagging a tail is amateur hour one must wag their whole body to achieve pure wiggle cuteness
izzy her dog walker records her reaction when he walks in and posts them on fb there‚Äôs one where she goes apeshit on the stairs gawd i love dogs
that s the shit that s the meaning of life right there
my dog doesn t have a tail and does the exact same butt wiggle
oh man those butt wags we had a rottweiler they have docked tails when i was growing up who made up for his lack of a tail by swinging his butt around as much as he could just like this so cute
being on aww after my dog passed hurts but it also feels so good these fluff balls look so cute
last time i had a dog was years ago and one of the best memories in my life is how he used to greet me every day when i returned home from work
hes not only wagging his tail but shaking his whole butt lol
i see the sratching post which means the cat is somewhere plotting
i can t wait to have a doggo in my life it has been years got to get my own house first this doggo warms my heart
when dogs show submission they roll over on their backs same with cats so that s nice
that wasnt just a butt wiggle thats a whole freakin body happy wiggle
does the dog wag the tail or does the tail wag the dog
damn just looking at that wagging makes my back hurts
you could power a small city for a week from the energy produced by that dogs tail
so you just stole this gif and repost it to make your shitty account take off f off please the oc is like a week ago
ahh the spaniel crab waggle also joined by the toy in the mouth classic spaniel ‚ô•Ô∏è
poor doggy probably thought it s owner was gone forever
there was a post here about a dog breaking his tail because he wag it to hard i cant find it
how old is the spaniel a few years ago we lost a chocolate spaniel that did exactly the same thing if you were an intruder she would run up barking before flopping over to ask for a belly rub if she knew you it was the same wagging until instability and flopping over
dogs that wag so hard they cannot control their bums warm my heart so much wigglebums ftw
nothing expresses ecstasy as well as the full body wag
‚Äúma‚Äôam i am very sorry your doggo has been diagnosed with butt wiggles yes it‚Äôs a stage ‚Äù
my dog when she hears my dad s truck door close holy fuck he s here aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
i was visiting my parents once and arrived when they were not at home of course i just let myself in and their dog an adorable min pin was doing the whole guard dog act barking and jumping and everything then he got a good sniff and realized it was me and immediately grabbed his leash to demand i take him for a walk the cheeky bastard love that li l guy
my dog is always like this to everyone and in the end dying from accident because he was trying to greet someone from across the road wish i taught him how to chill a little bit and listen
wow i‚Äôd never thought i‚Äôd get to see a tail wag a dog
why is nobody mentioning the bizarrely upholstered stairs
take the snacks take everything i have take my first born child i dont care i will do anything for this cat
i think that is the cutest little kitty i have ever seen great pic
i ve been trying to shove snacks through my screen i m gonna need a lot of glass cleaner
i‚Äôm not always on catnip but when i am i stare at you like this
this cat looks like he does commercials for diabeetus supplies
his eyes remind me of an oliver twist character please sir can i have some gruel
my room mate and i just had to put our cat asleep she used to be able to give high fives shake a paw and open a jar of kitty treat if it had been loosen sadly she either had a collapes lung or there was just fluids inside basically when i realized we needed to put her a sleep i is like i shut down if i ever figure it out i will post a link this is my second day on redit
just when i thought kitters couldn t possibly get any cuter
the cat looks like he s going to tell me about the benifits of eating quaker oatmeal or the dangers of diabetes and to always check my blood sugar levels
it looks like the kid that ate a whole onion while holding back tears because he demanded it was an apple
i don t know about snack for cats but she is very lovely
for the love of god somebody give that kitten snacks
i want a cat so bad urs is beautiful give him lots of love
turns from laptop to see this oh here ya go bud hands him a big of skittles
adorable cat who looks like he s had a few too many snacks to begin with
sorry for your loss she looks adorable in that picture
sorry for your loss they give my girl a couple more days and then they re probably putting her to sleep c feelsbadman
i m sorry for your loss but she looks like such a happy girl you two obviously love her dearly and have given her a great life and although we all know you can t replace mitzi she would want you to spread that love all around
let s hear it for mitzi faithful companion and bestest girl
so sorry for your loss rip mitzi she‚Äôs such a beauty
thank you so much everyone she was our sunshine we are lost without her but know the rainbow bridge is full of puppers welcoming our sweet girl home
i love levi but i have always lived by the mantra ‚Äúadopt don‚Äôt shop‚Äù i hope you were just saving up for a place with a yard and not giving your money to breeders best of luck to you and yours
he‚Äôs lovely congrats on your new puppy i know you‚Äôll take good care of him it‚Äôs hard waiting but he looks like he‚Äôs worth every minute and cent
hey just a tip those retractable leashes are actually super bad stick with a basic leash and throw that out
he looks like a very good boi congratulations on your new family member ‚ù§Ô∏è
it took a year because he was expensive or because you budgeted vet visits
i have been looking to get a dog this year anyone know what the best option to get one is i have thought about both adopting or buying a dog what do you guys think
if you aren t getting pet insurance don t they tend to be bad but bucks away a month he will get in trouble and you will be happy congrats he is so cute also speaking from experience
i love his pink little toes‚ù§Ô∏è we had an american eskimo and she was the smartest dog i ve ever known her vocabulary was huge and she learned all the alternatives we d try to use for words she knew like d p for dog park spelling out t r e a t all kinds of things she was also really outgoing thought all people existed to pet her and tell her how pretty she was the total opposite of the breed standard i d say with your combo that s going to be one popular and smart boy enjoy he s adorable
if you have to save up for a year just to buy a puppy then you can t afford to look after one
he is cute but please the more people who adopt the better off we all are limit the suffering of a poor animal and human and go to the pound and you wouldn t of even had to save that long
hello there levi i hope you enjoy your new family who has been waiting to love you congratulations on your new addition post pics as he grows hugs from me and sniffs from my husky joseph üêæ üíï üêæ
i would clog his little puppy arteries with ham and chicken then i would take him on extra walks to clear them up again
is this one of those shmancy designer dog mixes that cost a fortune i ve never seen anything like him
hello everyone i‚Äôve gotten a few repeated questions regarding little levi which i‚Äôll address here he is an australian shepherd and american eskimo mix he‚Äôs about weeks old and i acquired him through a posting that was seeking for him to be rehomed as their apartment complex didn‚Äôt allow pets to clarify what i meant by ‚Äúsaving up‚Äù i knew that i wanted to raise a puppy and decided to put away some money each month in its own ‚Äúpuppy‚Äù savings account i was saving up for future costs including initial toy and treat purchases vaccinations vet check ups and emergencies
why is his head so big why is his head so big sorry gir moment man i miss invader zim but levi is absolutely adorable
well this went off the rails quickly both sides make great points good breeders serve a great purpose and saving a rescue is a truly amazing act all my pound pups have brought such love and joy but you re taking a wonderful moment of excitement away from levi s new family little selfish and childish congrats to you and levi i hope you both enjoy many happy healthy and unpredictable years with each other
why not adopt dogs from a shelter for free a cheap price
yeah its cool but is he an attack on titans reference tho
saving up i hope you mean an emergency fund not just the price of the dog
omg this looks like my baby luna she looked just like this as a baby shes a toy aussie d
adoption is a more humane option so many dogs will be killed this year at shelters
i sare a name with this adorable pup that s it all i wanted to say for my first ever comment on reddit
i dont know why people spend so much on buying dogs when theres so many that need to be saved at the human society
oh my god it s so cute and fluffy and cute and cute
i always like to warn ppl who get a new puppy don t give them raw hide sticks they can choke and die on those
looks so much like my pupper did when he was little
much happier looking than the levi that first springs to mind
awwww levi s so adorable d and saving up for the pupper was very responsible
üòçhis head is huge congrats on being the proud puppy parent of a weird mix they are hands down the best and cutest kind
why does his eyes have red in them is he ok kinda tiny and cuite though
good that you saved up beyond the point of getting a dog just so the dog has all the essentials usually if you struggle to save up to get a dog you will struggle to raise it properly
you could have adopted one for and saved one from a shelter or animal control and i ll state this bluntly if you had to save up to buy a dog you re likely not financially equipped to take care of a dog and the vet bills you re going to deal with
it looks like its cat friends drew on its face with a sharpie when it was passed out drunk
wow i ve never seen a cat with that sort of coloring pattern so beautiful
unique and gorgeous my hubby is a veterinarian and even he hasn‚Äôt seen markings like this a jewel you have

white tail sounds like a name from the warrior series

the coloring reminds me of some sort of marble so pretty
looks like she got busy coloring with a dry erase marker i ve seen it happen at school quite often
in germany we have a cakewalk type that is looks similar to this cat we call it marble cake
the way the black spot is around the right eye gave me curse mark vibes
first thought is that beauty curved out of marble she s so gorgeous
looks like a white kitty rolled around played with a black sharpy still cute though
i think that is the prettiest cat i have ever seen in my life and i m years old
i have never seen a cat that color before i am absolutely entranced
this cat looks like it killed my friends in a severely out of touch movie about an interweb killer
looks like an evil boss with a monocle and thin mustache
i m a little sad the neighborhood cat that i hang out with and give scratches on the head has clawed me today what do i do üòî
i m not locked in here with you you re locked in here with me

look at how happy all those other humans get when they see a soldier and his good girl reunite ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
this is the best feeling ever i like going home seeing my dog react
it s a tough competition for which reunions are better humans seeing humans or pets seeing humans
sound on makes it a thousand times better even though it was already perfect kira makes noises that are the closest to happy tears i ve ever heard from a dog and that brought tears to my eyes
bonds between humans and pets are amazing someone needs to stop cutting onions though
way to gentrify all the troops budday casey is a fantastic human being that flew to new zealand to be with his wife while she birthed their first child t minutes until you delete your comment i bet
it saddens me to know i will never have anyone that happy to see me
i really liked the older gent taking out his phone so he too could share this moment that s how you know it super duper wholesome
the first time i was ever hospitalized i had a keeshonden she had already been with me for years i collapsed and was gone for over a month thankfully friends and neighbors helped out the day i came home amp x b my dog was so excited she couldn t even bark she just rapidly wagged her tail made this weird noise i ve never heard and proceeded to faint i thought she had a heart attack she was fine just over excited we actually went through this a couple of times she would wake up see and smell that i was home get super excited and wear herself out in seconds amp x b she finally realized i wasn t going anywhere and calmed down she lived to the ripe old age of our years not theirs amp x b i miss her everyday she was the bestest doggo the coco dog the first coco dog
i like how she runs around like ‚Äúthis is my soldier and he‚Äôs the beat notice him ‚Äù
thank you for your duty and your loyalty kira the goodest girl
ready to play amp x b ready to play amp x b ready to play
old fella in the back now how do i get to the camera app again oh yeah no here oh yeah here we go

my grandparents had a german shepard named nero he lived to be we only went to visit on the weekends then every other weekend nero was opa s loyal side kick and when we would visit he was trained not to get excited and such he stuck to opa s side like a magnet but that face of pure joy and his tail wagging waiting for us to come to him i ve seen so many well trained pets since then but none as well as that you could tell over time it had become nero wanted to be with opa at all times no command needed once allowed though he got up and wanted to be pet and held and be a lap dog quietly excited and super loving the last three years of his life were spent watching over and protecting my late aunts dog that my grandparents took in nero was almost ammused by the soccer ball sized adult dog that had become his best pal bow was to small for nero to really play with directly without toys but on the other hand if bow got to uppity nero would walk over sit or lay down and just place a big paw or foreleg over bow lazily and keep the poor pup trapped there nero passed in his sleep at home at years old with his best pal and his owner laying next to him
how long it took that old man walking out behind him to open his camera app is so funny to me

this is so cute we don t deserve dogs god i ve been away for months and i m going back in days i miss my dog so much and i ve had nightmares in which she wouldn t recognize me and wouldn t be happy to see me i m scared
dogs have been our first friend in this world and have stood with us for more than years we are family to them and they love us deeply dogs are too pure for this world they really are
my wife and i wouldnt be able to do this my dog pees whenever he gets super excited hes
you can almost tell she knows she‚Äôs not supposed to jump up like that but just contain herself it‚Äôs adorable

i love the genuine smiles on the people who see this
the fact that it says her main man makes me have some questions
whenever my dad came back from tdy or deployments our dogs would always get this excited to see him this really brought some tears to my eye because dogs are just too good of family members to us humans this also makes me miss my dad and now i should call him lol
i love how at the pups like hey mom you come over here and love on him too its okay i share before running back for more
is nobody going to complain about the man filming vertically behind him
at the end when she finally calmed down just a tiny bit did you see he s home did you see d amp x b i m not crying at all

man in the back recording to put his perspective up on reddit
must have seen over dog meets returning vet videos and they still make me so happy
i don t get why some soldiers travel in or are even allowed to travel in acu s solo it just reeks of attention seeking that lt isn t coming from overseas wrong uniform type though he has deployed before based on the patch so he should have had the chance to change lovely dog and wholesome interaction though edit before people call me out those are still acu s the pattern is ocp but the designation is still acu previous pattern was ucp also while the pattern is the same the deployment uniform has fire resistant coating on it that makes it looks like hotshit after one wash
honest question how come americans in the army always wear camo off duty between missions and in retirement
watch out his enemy stand is „Äåk i l l e r q u e en„Äç
my mom has two toy fox terriers one of them she s had since he was a puppy his name is seamus he gets really bad separation anxiety when she leaves their house and once he calms down he s almost in a depressed state it s kinda sad he gets really excited when she comes home and that s pretty cute when we took my daughter over there for the first time though seamus was so excited that we thought he was going to faint he was running around in circles yipping happily jumping up on whomever was holding the baby he was so interested in her he calmed down a bit and we felt comfortable kneeling down for him to sniff her he smelled her head and took off running in a happy circuit around the house he made himself tired and curled up in my mom s lap any little noise my daughter made he was up and investigating he was acting like he had be separated from my daughter for a long time and they were finally reunited even though it was the first time they had met it s so strange the way dogs brains work
killer queen has already touched the downvote button
i wish i could give this hundreds of upvotes soldiers coming home to their dogs are my favorite thing to watch after a bad day definitely saving this one
judging by that reaction he‚Äôs been gone for at least minutes
my lab does this every day i come home from work not this much but he is always happy to see me dogs are great for making you feel good about yourself because they always think you‚Äôre awesome
was anyone else watching how that old man was trying to pull his camera app out and finally figured it out may be has a iphone or something by the looks of it

this is the sweetest thing in the world my girl is currently watching my cups my while i travel the country interviewing for new jobs when i see my babies again i‚Äôm gonna be like kira here to them running over kissing prancing i love my and all doggies

i almost started crying from my extreme smiling caused by this video seriously dogs are the best ‚ù§Ô∏è also kudos to the guy serving his country he deserves to come home to such a happy goofy fluffball
you can tell this guy is a bad ass by the way he didn‚Äôt cry like a bitch like i woulda done
how long can you leave a dog behind until they forget who you are
nice the collie of my parents great me everytime like that when i visit them he cant move that much like that because of the space but he is loud sometimes like a real chewbacca
i don t get it my dog male dachshund loves my mom but when she goes back home for months my dog barks at her like she s any old intruder upon her return granted he gets used to her after like minutes which is quicker than a random stranger but seeing these i haven t seen my dog in years and she still loves me makes me at least the tiniest bit envious
weird that never happens to me oh well prolly need to replace the cat and get a dog instead üòÇ
love how dogs just don t what to do they don t have hugs as a means of portraying immediate affection so they just lather us is in frantic whatever
i love the old guy in the background trying to open the camera app reminds me of my dad trying do anything on his phone
fucking love how dogs don t know how to respond when they re so happy
i was waiting for her zoomies to take her into the restricted zone but she say the sign and knew she shouldn t go there
i love that it not only made her human s day but it made everyone s day

dude in the background that just stops and records the whole interaction i know it‚Äôs harmless but something about people stopping to record other people‚Äôs lives and interactions just freaks me out i wouldn‚Äôt have lasted if i were famous
does this really mean the dog is excited to see him a lot of times it turns out animal just act a certain way but humans always try to describe as they are showing emotions etc
aww come on military dog owner reunion videos are cheating
gotta be honest it s great to see this kind of reminds me of how i would ve felt if i had experienced this with my dog ashame she died right when i landed a bitter homecoming but seeing these reunions videos are rather wholesome d

i do not think the lady in the house has ever pet a dog before thats some awkward ohhhh what do i do here nice doggy
no screen door how is that place not crawling with bugs
could i have a party where i just invite people s dogs i guess the people could come too
that proud prance up to the door like ‚Äòlook what i brought you ‚Äô
i prefer to believe that he was not invited and just decided to crash the party and of course nobody minded
when you knew there was a slim chance you‚Äôd get invited to the party on the block and you got invitation
so cute i love how excited he is when he gets inside plus the light steps up to the house like he knows he s cute thanks for this i needed it today
i want all my presents from now on to be delivered this way üòâ
kayla the stop sign jeez watch that car pedestrian fuck me concentrate

would you let a child ride in your car like that asshole
imagine someone was paid money to make you deformed like this cat so cute i wish owners of these cats had to live with deformed legs like they do how cute would that be wow so cute
brakes hard to a full stop mmmmmmmmmmmmmeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeoooooooooooooooooooooooowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww crash ded
if you have to stop suddenly that cat won‚Äôt look so cute anymore it‚Äôs standing on its carrier ffs not safe
better than our last kitty s car rides where he d endlessly keen crawl under the seats and poop repeatedly
i showed my girlfriend this and she pooped in a box in the living room relationship goal
sure it‚Äôs cute when she does it but when i do it my girlfriend says i‚Äôm ‚Äúneedy‚Äù
what breed is she does her ears stay like that forever
did she have one of her ears tipped it looks a little smaller than the other my kitty has an ear tip and it‚Äôs so cute

adorable thanks for sharing his little sweet spirit with us
what a sweet pupper i m so sorry for your loss they really take a piece of us with them üíï
so sorry for your loss your pup looks so happy and content here though i‚Äôm sure this little guy had a life full of love and comfort
i am so sorry for your loss hope you are okay sadly we only get to spend a small amount of our lives with these wonderful beings but looking at his face it sure looks he had a really good time with you
now that is the look of a dog that knew he was loved i know it s so hard to say goodbye but in moments like this there s a maxim that s always brought me comfort remember that while they are but a few chapters in the story of your life you make up their entire book all of the comfort joy and companionship that they gave you you also gave them for their entire lives because of you his existence was one of joy and comfort i hope that helps
im sorry for your loss it looks like you gave him a wonderful lifeüå∑
try to get this sweetie adopted if you can t adopt at least spread the word this one deserves the chance at a good life if i could i d adopt this one
maybe she had a broken heart but she‚Äôs currently on the mend right before your very eyes ‚ù§Ô∏è
my naem are cat am have a home no mor cold nights i spend alone am not afraid am safe insted i feelin good i rub the bed
unrelated but i love that quilt cat is pretty too congrats
i live relatively close to the island where these lol guys come from rottnest island i live in perth rottnest is a min ferry ride away and i can tell you they are friggin adorable
gotta appreciate natural selection giving creatures what humans perceive as smiling
i surf just next to the island nothing better than the rotto island pub and these badboys running around
if we as a planet let these adorable lil‚Äô fuckers even sniff extinction the human race has failed
the quokka the first species getting worldwide exposure because of and will likely be eradicated because of social media
very cute i definitely want one as a pet friend i wonder what it looks like when angry though it looks like it evolved to be cute
fun fact if a mother quokka is feeling threatened by a predator she will throw her young to the predator to escape
the tourist love them but the locals hate them they are very organised thieves
i m working over in perth just now and might have to extend my stay if i do i m heading back out to rottnest to chill with these adorable little buggers again
yeah saw them on my first trip to rottnest last year damn they cute
everytime i see a quokka post i have to respond they occur on the mainland not just on rottnest island they are listed as vulnerable same as the koala the rottnest island quokka s are horrible flea bitten things and half the size of a healthy mainland quokka
they always look like they just finished smoking a bowl
see not everything in australia wants to kill you üòá
been to rottnest and can agree that they are adorable
they‚Äôre cute until you know that if they‚Äôre chased by predator they‚Äôll use their babies as a bait for them to have more time escaping
i regret not going to rottnest island when i was in perth earlier this year perth is quite possibly the furthest place on the earth from where i live
it s a shame this photo is photoshopped though they re cute enough as they are look at the background bending around its cheeks
don‚Äôt be fooled by their beady little eyes they are actually agents sent by the kangaroo overlords to spy on us the adorable part is how they attract us to it to gain information
the hopes and dreams of the west australian tourism board rest on this furry dudes little shoulders
i saw them during my trip to australia almost as cute as racoons
if henry winkler was an animal he would be this little guy for sure
thanks for the appreciation everyone it means a lot to me
they say don‚Äôt touch them or get too close the one i took a selfie with wouldn‚Äôt leave me alone i gave him a little stroke when he wouldn‚Äôt leave me alone and then he kept following me followed by flopping over for belly scratches best day ever
aren t these the ones that will throw their children at predators as a distraction to escape
i‚Äôm going to australia for the first time later this year and i cannot wait to meet these little fuckers
reposts in less than an hour with this same picture and title gtfo here
i wish we had these but then i remember we have raccoons and most of the world doesn t
the only animal in australia that isn t trying to be deadly or kill everyone but will actually come up to humans and be cute
they look like the things in ice age that went against the pirates and shit
watch it it might be preparing to murder you then overtake the rest if humanity
when you start a new character in skyrim but you haven‚Äôt leveled up his sneak yet
and steeeeepppppp and steepppppp i am a big kitty i am a big kitty
the tail and hand attack confident gurrrrrl or boah
the mighty hunter stalks his prey majestic and proud
i watched this gif so many times that i don t need to wait for it to know what happens next
when i was little my cats would freak out when it got stormy so my mom told me that they were just worried if it started ‚Äúraining cats and dogs‚Äù they‚Äôd be next
are you from ohio we went through the same thing glad you re safe
my closet is my cat s everyday panic oh no doorbell room and i do hope he d be kind enough to share it in case of a tornado i have my doubts
that tornado must ve been really bad at hide n seek
i love when people have a colour scheme with their pets
man the shit you americans have to go through feels bad man
is that a chocolate german shepherd or is the lighting making them look brown rather than black or some other reason lol
if you live in the midwest part of the the us you ve had some of practice this year with tornado drills
you can follow the adventures of sister chicken and inara on ig the big eared shepherd
i have sat in the bathtub before with my doxie and beagle have no idea why we didnt go to a closet thankfully i am out of that area
why would anyone hide in a closet instead of evacuating in advance
i‚Äôve only had to hide in a bathroom once and god it was scary i was so convinced something was going to touch down because my cat who is normally calm during storms was shaking in fear
ya gotta have the biggest set of cahones to live in tornado alley i couldn t do it
good cat that pack of paper towels would be shredded at my house
omg what kind of pupper is that it looks like the egyptian god anubis
glad you are safe i live miles from where that storm hit but got lucky enough to have a basement to put my babies in
i can‚Äôt tell if the cats in survival mode or anger w that look like either he‚Äôs smart and can tell what‚Äôs going on or he‚Äôs like wtf am i doing here hooman
ahhhh she‚Äôs so cute thanks for sharing her insta love the pics üòç
stupid question why go into a closet is it just to stay away from windows
would this closet actually protect you in any way from a tornado seems like the equivalent of hiding your head under the covers to avoid the boogey man
i had to do this with my sister s dog once and he laid down a nose rotting fart almost immediately after i shut us in the closet luckily nothing happened but i m sorry i left you to the will of the tornado elvis
oklahoma i‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs what we did with our yorkie
i just wanna say it s good to know there are people out there who make sure their pets are safe as well when there is severe weather growing up my dad always made me feel like i was being ridiculous when i would look for the cats and throw them a little ungraciously out of sheer panic lol in the basement as soon as i heard the sirens
they are both looking at you like um he s touching me
that tornado is probably so mad it couldn t find you
do your dogs ears act as part of the early warning system glad y‚Äôall are safe
i‚Äôm in ct we have a tiny bit of thunder and my dog has taken cover under the table he doesn‚Äôt know how lucky he is that we have no tornadoes for the most part
oh wow i‚Äôve never thought about pets dealing with a tornado warning do they act differently compared to your average rainstorm
yeah the tornado in kansas missed me by less than a mile shit was tense
that would make me unbearably happy plus check out all the penguins in the background what a cool job amazing video d
its sad that he she is going to get really ugly in the future
‚Äòwalking around on these what do you call them feet ‚Äô
its sucks that wildlife photographers aren‚Äôt allowed to pet or interact with the animals
would have been funny if they do what dogs do and start to chew on stuff and were his feet
i love situations like this but part me was waiting for the critter to chomp on the guy s leg i wonder if photographers worry about stuff like that
are we sure dont elephant seals have big bulbous snouts
i have no idea how the photographer holds back on snuggling the heck outta the cute lil sea slug pupper face
wearing seal skin booties seal ooooh these do feel nice
not sure if this is him but national geographic photographer paul nicklen has a lot of experience photographing arctic wildlife he says that newly weaned baby elephant seals are super curious and affectionate and will frequently interact with and cuddle up to wildlife photographers he s got lots of pictures of them on his instagram
just remember that if your a wildlife photographer that you aren t allowed to interact with the animals that means no petting or playing your job is to observe them not socialize with them if they come to you then just let them do there thing and dont interfere d
i would be too tempted to pet all the animals i encounter to be a wildlife photographer it‚Äôs just too tempting
is this an elephant seal the adult sized one in the back left doesn t appear to have a trunk nor does this infant one do only some get the trunk google mentioned males and females using the trunk in various ways is this just a normal seal or does the trunk develop later
if that happened to me and i was a photographer i would quit just to pet him yes animal photographers can t pet or feed the animals
serious question what are the chances you could pet his head and still keep five fingers
whatcha doin pet me gonna pet miself with feet whatcha doin
the sad part is he has to not interact with this ball of happiness
sad thing is they cant be nice to the animal or the animals will get to nice with humans
i know you re not supposed to interfere with the wildlife but why tf did you not pat him look at him he s such a good seal
meanwhile there i was being a hero filming so that my karma would also flood
but who is the we from that title op are you a puppy be honest
i hope they inherit the earth and treat it better than we have
i didn‚Äôt realize this was playing on a loop i was waiting for an end that showed all the puppies together but i realized something was off when the dog brought out the th pupper
wow what a unique looking kitty love his her coloring very pampered kitty
what kind of cat is this its beautiful has it got a beard like lincoln
head cat body lion tail jackal it s a wonderfully wonderful cat
‚Äùthe best part of waking up is mouthfuls of cat hair in your cup ‚Äù
awesome cat but more importantly i have a jura coffee maker too they kick ass
i don t know why but this cat is so striking it s almost intimidating
is that cat part giraffe or something why is his neck so long
beautiful cat completely gross having an animal that scratches in a box of shit and urine standing on a machine that is supposed to make my drink
i m going to guess that machine got a cub heater on top which is what gets the cat very interested in sitting on
your cat is great but that jura is goddamn beautiful i want one so bad
are you gandalf by chance this looks like a master wizard‚Äôs cat
oh my god please give it some love he just wants love
lol think he trying to audition for the live version of the cat in the movie shrek ‚Äúpuss‚Äù i think was the name lol
brushing those cheeks with both your thumbs will be the end all to anxiety
don‚Äôt cats bred to have ears like this develop early onset arthritis
this is the cutest kitten i have seen in a very long time
he looks like he s going to school for the first time it s too cute
this literally made me cry the little bow tie his ears does he know does he know how special he is
congratulations you have sorted by new claim your reward
i sort by top this hour and this was the first post congrats
those eyes can see through the ever swirling cosmos that is the void
he s so fluffy he looks unreal give him a scritch for me
just straight up front page for me actually cute kitty lt s
those eyes are very dilated and based off of past experience this guy is ready to fuck shit up
are we back to this stupid ‚Äúif you sorted by new‚Äù nonsense again i thought we had finally moved on
i have a car named miko to he is named after pocahontas
didn‚Äôt sort by new am i even allowed to look at this
new post so op sees this too don‚Äôt get me wrong op miko is adorable and i‚Äôd love to rub his fluffy belly but let him stand on his own without cliched titles he deserves better titles than this
my neighbors have a baby boy who looks just like that named miko i clicked on your profile and saw that nsfw tag i was like oh no
i m not being dramatic but i need you to tell miko that i love him and am willing to go to war for him
awww i used to have a cat named miko she was the best i hope yours provides as much love and caring as mine did may she rest in peace
looks like it‚Äôs being held up by a giant teddy bear
looks like he has a ditto face but with big ass adorable black holes for eyes
such a cutie miko looks so soft and cuddly i wish i could pet his deadly kitten mittens ‚ô°
saying something like those who short by new or this probably dies at new or this gets only two upvotes is reddits equivalent of girls saying they look ugly to fish compliments
i honestly dont know how onyx works but i think this might be it god damn those gorgeous eyes sucking me deep into an endless abyss
i m gonna be honest i think cat wants to bring about the apocalypse
my god the fluffiest and most adorable kitty ive seen after mine of course
he is the most beautiful little creature üòçüòç get him an ig and share that sweet face with the world
i love how happy all the people are to see the dog genuine delight
i bike with my frenchie in the k sack convinced people speed up to meet us at a red light just to give him a pet
all the videos in the past that s made me think i need that time back after watching that well this video just restored seconds of those precious minutes of my time
i watched this three times we need more footage of this
i ve seen this guy dog in person much cuter in real life
he been hoeing himself out for scritches did you see that headmove
must be a pain when the dog pees poops in the backpack
thank goodness i live in nyc i need to pet the corgi
woah dude crazy i‚Äôm in this video truly a wholesome corgi
i know i‚Äôm so sorry for your loss and i don‚Äôt even know you
i both love and hate how bitter sweet life can be to give us something long enough to nearly take it for granted and then take it away without ample notice the secret for me is to choose what aspects of those memories to focus on i like to remember all the good and just enough of the bad not to avoid future mistakes
i am such a moron i thought this was about the fake deer at first your doggo looks like they were such a love
that sucks pets dying sucks i m really sorry op take care
why are scientists trying to help people live longer when dogs still live for only a fraction of our time
sorry op can‚Äôt imagine how tough it is mourn and ask remember to celebrate the great times i‚Äôm sure y‚Äôall had i remember losing my doggie and the first year was tough when i‚Äôd let out the other dogs in the morning and being half asleep i usually count to make sure they‚Äôre all back in a few times i counted them in and paused waiting for the ‚Äòlast‚Äô one and then snapping out of it and then bawling for a bit cause i remembered she wasn‚Äôt coming inside anymore
i‚Äôm so sorry for your loss i know this feeling multiplied by because the bitch ex kept them all
sorry for your loss it s been a couple of months since i lost my gsd i literally think of him everyday at first i d hear certain noises that i thought were from him now i hear noises that i know would trigger a reaction from him
the only thing i look forward to after work is immediately hugging my dogs for ten minutes
my heart is heavy thinking of all the guys and good girls i‚Äôve lost over the years ‚Ä¶ never gets easier so sorry
sorry for your loss don t be surprised if this is removed per rule
i m sorry that you lost this friend not for nothing do many people perceive animals as being as good as not better than people
same here she was always in her spot when i came home from work years
ugly crying here it s terrible when we lose our furry family members
the thing that helped me be happy it s not the other way around him waiting for you but you aren t coming home again you can deal with loss you understand it pets don t
i don t know what the fox says but this one is so cute
so when can we expact the real steins gate sequel we all deserve
loving the fox but tbh the pink is a bit off putting
genuine question can you de stink a fox like you would a skunk i was under the impression that it was the urine itself that is so unbearably awful how are people keeping them as pets
that cyber ninja is white fox upvote if you get the reference i do this for any kind of fox i see
a new challenger appeared on muscle fox battle a chinese kenpo master whipping out a right jab
waiting for the exotic pets ish evuls comments and then it will turn out the op is some wildlife rehab person and also thinks the same thing
secs or and it s totally adorable how he just freezes in place
how do you walk around your dog without leash our dog would go nutz and probably get lost
even remembers his friends owner and greets him too
bob i haven t smelled your butt in ages how the hell are you
i like that asher greets the human too but bad news his best friend doesn t give a shit about you in return
he has never been more excited to sniff someones but
huh you dod and my son have the same name not sure how i feel about this
the pupper in the back looked like he wanted to join in too
this is adorable i just had to put down my oldest doggo because of a brain tumor our other doggo still waits for him by the back door for a minute before going out breaks my heart a bit every time
stabbot is broken everyone there is no eta for when it s going to be back up
get yourself a pixel and never have shaky video again
‚Äì hey bud what have you done all this time ‚Äì you ll see just smell my butt
erica you sound like a robot when you walk that is all i m pretty neutral about it
i initially thought the human was asher s best friend this is even cuter than that
is smelling each others butt the dog version of a fist bump
you know you should really marry that guy for the sake of the dogs
you should have your dog on a lead he could attack anyone
thank you for sharing asher with us what a sweet boy he makes me smile every time i see him
so sweet i love how they run back to the guy like omg look who s here though i m a little seasick now from watching it one too many times
that hunched over arm waggin look that guy gave after petting the other dog was wholesome i d say
i expected to get harassed for my camera work but i honestly wasn t expecting so much judgment for my waterproof pants üòÑ
this is so sweet thanks for sharing dogs give me life
oh sweet lewis my heart üíôüíú so sweet thank you for sharing friend
not to be that person but i m pretty sure those are both full grown dogs looks like an australian shepherd and a long haired chihuahua or papillon mix
i have an pound boxer and a pound yorkie they play tug of war and it is hysterical the yorkie gets sent literally flying across our living room on a regular basis
i don t know why but i was expecting momma to be a human almost the same size tho
that‚Äôs not a puppy that‚Äôs a mini aussie and a big aussie
i thought the pup was the mom at first since it looks just like our dog that just had a pup of her own difference between shelties and collies
mom knows exactly where the traction ends and slick floor begins
i m winning i m winning i m dang it mom that pup probably
pup look ma i m winning ma i was letting you win pup ma lt jerks rope sending pup across room gt
smol dog yay tug of war yank yank yank bigger dog oh we are playing leash
why doesn‚Äôt life looks at beautiful as this guys living room
yeah come on mom you cant win this yeah sure whatever kid
on top of the size difference you got carpet vs hard floor at play little doggo never had a chance
was honestly expecting the first one to be the mom and then this monster comes into frame
that field day tug of war where your homeroom of anime nerds and goths go up against the homeroom unevenly stacked with half the football team
this reminds me of the ‚Äúzoom‚Äù videos the kids were doing a couple years ago
the dog is like what do i do now how do i get out of this
he s like kuato the cat quaaaiiiid oh wait meeeeoooowwww
aww i hope they have a home i would take both of them if i were there

omelette is gorgeous üòç how do you make your cat so happy mine purrs all the time but i could never get this smile
my ginger boi has almost identical brown patterns on his fur only he is one very very fluffy boi sheds hair everywhere god forbid he climbs into your lap when you have a black t shirt on which he is prone to doing

it‚Äôs actually my new years resolution to eat more omelettes
i appreciate that name for a cat its colour is well suited
now omlette needs to have a friend named cheese omledue fromage
omg i needed to see this right now omlette is the best softest looking kitty many treats are warranted i ‚ù§wuvs‚ù§ him thanks for sharing
such a pretty kitty i wanna scritch behind the ears
holy fuck i love omelette i have an orange boy with similar markings named pancake i also would die for him
thought it was interesting to learn that the majority of orange tabby cats are male
damn i have an orange cat too but her markings aren t as distinct as your kitty he s beautiful
this is literally my dream cat those markings that pink nose i would take any number of bullets for omelette
hes so orange give him a few scritches for me please
he or she reminds me of my beloved fenrir that we had put to sleep last year what a lovely cat
now all you need is another cat and name it fromage
gorgeous boy reminds me of my ginger boys that i used to have miss them so much
that s not a cat that s a tiger look at the stripes üòç
omelette great name i named my cats slippers and breakfast
please tell omelette i love him and would do anything for him
for some reason food names for cats are so adorable my friend got two cats named lasagne and cakeüôä
we must have the same cat because my cat is orange and cute as hell too
that is a dope name now you need another cat named cheese
what beautiful tiger stripes love the vibrant colour and the happy smile
omelette looks like a painting omg su cute sorry i love animals
i ve been taking care of his twin brother for winters
with that beautiful fur and big ole grin we shall only refer to that cat as cheesy omelette from this day forth
does omelette have any social media we could follow this cutie on
i saw the nose and was like ohhwww cute i saw the eye and i m like oh god no
wen i try smel my snoot iz blu but wen my i iz red i c u
pssst this hole is exactly treat sized neighbor gives side eye
i don t know if it is just me but this looks very fake photoshopped probably
wow a rare rainbow dog with red eyes and a blue nose
i m still trying to figure out how that eye is so big compared to the nose it s further away and still looks huge
my dog max has a particular fascination with jamming his head through a small hole in the gate looking out onto the road and just sit there and watch everything going on sometimes he sits there for like an hour at a time i have no idea what captivates him so much
i thought that was a fence made from a quaking aspen üòÇ
how my brain interprets this picture must sniff first could be danger no danger hi hooman i see you
at first i thought it was the mechanical rhino s butt from ace ventura
keep an eye on the spy and give him treats as you walk by
there is little white lines around the nose this is edited
plot twist it‚Äôs actually your neighbour n he‚Äôs using the dog first to lower your defencesüò≥
my neighbos golden watches me go to work every morning i can see his head poking out from behind the curtains am doesn t care about my wife when leaves a half hour later
good afternoon sir have you heard about the power of boop siiiir
the nose looks abit like jack skellington with santa beard
the nose made me think it was the face of a giant moth and now i m scared
having been in a train for three hours and then stuck in the same train for another three this has made me laugh thank you op
this is so funny that i laughed and all the jizz from this morning s sexytime came out
oh hey i think it smells like him ok ok tough guy routine and say something scary hey kid wanna see a leaf yeaaah that works
on fist glance it looked like one picture where those where it‚Äôs eyes
little did you know that dog is actually a monster with a dogs snoot
thought for a sec i was looking at a david bowie dog one brown eye and one wait a second that‚Äôs a strange looking eye
thats hilarious i agree the eyeball is a little bit wth
we need someone to draw what that dog would look like if the nose and eye were both from the same animal
you should put your butt against the fence and say hello
i thought this was a single picture for a second and it freaked me out
teaming sent samples to compare against former neighbors for analysis
looking at the first picture without reading the title aww what a cute owl
maybe he s checking up on you dogs are wonderfull in this way amp x b ps in the first pic he s nose looks like a single blackberry not the phone
should have took another photo but with the dogs asshole centered in the hole
nothing has even been so cute and so terrifying at the same time
i didn t realize what i was looking at for a good minute but the snoot poking in is all kinds of adorable
do dogs normally have eyes the size of their nose i will be looking more closely at dogs now also what colouring is this dog must be gorgeous looks sort of golden red around the eye and black grey around the nose
any of my digital artist dude out there i am very suspicious that this is photoshopped i mean look at the nose and the eye dogs have these big eyes
reminds me of that scene from jurassic park where the raptors are at the window of the kitchen
glad i‚Äôm not the only one scared shitless of that eye
eyes and ears and mouth a and nose do ggie knows your favourite pose favourite pose
your neighbour dog smells on you and hes owner spies on you ü§î
doesn t look like the eye goes with the nose an ant eater and a horse
i thought the eye was the owner of the dogo gave me quite the scare
i love the fact that both pictures are spying since dogs use their nose just as much to learn what others are doing
i was legit wondering how they got the dog to take a picture of their eye goes without saying but i don t feel very smart today
thought it was david bowie sneaking a peak there for a second
stared at this for a solid seconds before i realized it s not an owl on the left üòÇ
am i the only one who sees jack skellington on the left picture
im gonna have nightmares of that eye tonight lol is that really a dog
you think he is spying in you but actually he s spnosing on you
at first glance i thought the one on the left was a tiny owl
only way this post could be better is if it involved a baby goat
i love how you can tell he wants to wag his tail on the way down but it upsets his balance
i will no doubt get down voted but wanted to say it looks like for the doggo s second slide the people at the bottom decided to walk from right to left of the picture again
somebody get their child the stairs are not meant for playing üòÜüòÜüòÜ
looking that the thumbnail i thought the dog was pooping good clip though
not one of the billion people on this earth has ever said that
i used to slide down the railing at my old job when i worked night shift only perk of my am quitting time
trick edit to make it look like the dog slid down again reality is buddy put it up there gave it a little nudge to slide down then he looped it just right
this appears to be a fake it s clearly looped at the beginning of the second turn
i love the brief backwards glance at the bottom of the slide before hopping off to go again
oh god i am a pro at saying no to a very adorable toddler but even i d have a problem saying no to this
hello fellow canadian that s a nice steam whistle opener you have there
i can hear the bones they are calling to me they require all my love and attention think of the bones human
hi you should crack a steam whistle while he enjoys his
just tie a dishtowel to the freezer door says pupper
whenever my dog goes to the treat closet i like to pretend i have no idea what she wants i like it when she starts stomping her paws in frustration
is there a reason you freeze marrow bones don t they usually keep fine after being supercooked
how is your fridge so immaculate and free of magnets
you know you re an alcoholic when you have a bucket for beer caps stuck to your fridge let me guess bottle opener on your key chain
you do know if animals had opposable thumbs we‚Äôd be screwed
i love steam whistle and i love pilsners noine noine
i make dog biscuits save all dog okay food scraps in freezer when i have enough blitz them in food processor with dog okay grain and pumpkin or whatever i have around bake them then freeze them for portions okay so our dog knows the sound of our freezer opening and every single time the freezer drawer opens he runs from where he is in the house usually asleep and sits to receive a cookie even if it isn t kennel time
if only i had an opposing thumb i wouldn t need humans
i have that same fridge magnet yours from brewery tour too i wish i had that same doggo what a cutie
i m not trying to sound judgmental but i think you may have a drinking problem amp x b what i mean is why would you drink corona when you could drink steam whistle
you sure he doesn‚Äôt just want one of those giant coronas
psh and people say dogs can‚Äôt talk gettin the message loud and clear buddy
the lynx is one of those animals that for some reason i can t look without thinking it s a pokemon
how does such a derp turn into a ferocious killing machine
well he doesn t look like he s missing a meal as long as there are no canadians missing then awwwww hell for such a cutypie i can even turn a blind eye to one or two
canadian lynx in montana immigration out of control
mama can you show me how it s done don t worry dear you ll have plenty of time to kill
never seen a cat that looks that much like a khajiit love it
they look like actual humans in costume for a cat‚Äôs broadway audition
best picture of the day for me absolutely adorable and more thanks for sharing
wild cubs kittens looks so much more angry than standard house cats
pay close attention little one this is the unamused face as a cat you must learn to make this your default face
cute and cuter from left to right if you are wondering
beautiful pic of two amazing animals and spring flowers how purrfect
is there an animal out there that looks more stoned than a lynx love it
ha saw these things in yellowstone fun fact i live in montana and see wild animals monthly
i read that as though someone called her bridget mountain
would love a pet lynx if i could guarantee it wouldn‚Äôt kill me in my sleep
lol it s such a repost that i made it my profile pic last time i saw it
i have a friend that is scared of alpacas and i don t know why but how you look at that face and be scared
mfw i see a friend who was going thru some rough times but now they re succeeding and back on a positive life track
alpacas truly are awesome went to an alpaca ranch once and didn t want to leave they are cute and all but they are also very interesting animals the may their mouth moves no teeth on top except at the very back which they only use to fight each other over mates they use communal toilet spots away from their grazing areas the way their feet and legs move as they walk their pack behavior the sounds they make really cool animals and cute to boot
almost looks like a stuffed animal plushie instead of a real animal it s just too cute
this picture is reposted so much but i don t care because its soooooo cute
fall out boy and frosty and the nightmare making machine
son looks happy as shit arms all out like he‚Äôs on a rollercoaster haha
son that‚Äôs wrong you look like you‚Äôre on a rollercoaster
hands up in the air as if he s being held at a gunpoint chill you re white it s all gonna be fine
literally just got done giving my hedge a bath so very cute
to imagine giving birth to a fookin hedgehog no thanks
no offense but the son looks like manny‚Äôs apology gift
look at that stupid little thing it s so freaking cute it doesn t even look real
silly humans interrupt cat s afternoon jog with their dumb games
gdi i cat stand people rushing the field it s disruptive to the game disrespectful to the players and just fucking rude herp derp paws what you re doing and look at me can we please stop this garbage meow purrfect assholes the lot of em
that is the face of someone going somewhere important let the cat pass
i am the black panther and i wish to join your game humans
i was at that game it was the most exciting thing that happened during the match unfortunately
show of hands who s ever gone to the shelter to look and not come back with a new friend amp x b bueller anyone üòÅ amp x b congratulations on your new floofs
you never just look it always end with you having more mouths to feed when you get back home
yeh went to the dogs home and came back with the craziest jack russell ever to grace the earth
they re fluffy and they come in pairs i see this as an absolute win
congrats i fostered a litter of kittens kept the girl second girl got adopted at the vets office we were getting her looked at boys went to the shelter one wednesday a friend told me they were all still there after a month i told her that i was gonna go get them the following saturday cuz i really liked them and couldn‚Äôt beat that they were still there got in and was told all three were adopted by the same person the day before because they couldn‚Äôt bear to split them up
holy shit about years ago my mom and i went to the vet and there were two kittens in a cage at the front desk that were up for adoption they were brother and sister and looked exactly like this unfortunately they both passed before their time
they are so irresistibly cute thank you for giving them a home and love
have fun cleaning everything all the time with those balls of floof they‚Äôre a blessing but omg so much work to keep things clean
i did this twice and now i m no longer allowed to go to the shelter by myself the first time i went because my cat was getting sick and i knew i would need comfort i left with kitties one being part maine coon then i went to get another cat for my maine coon to play with because her sister was not interested i ended up getting kittens luckily the play together just fine and the th gets to do her own thing i regret nothing
lovely kitties take them to heart love them and give them a good home
dont blame ya i d have brought those fluffs home too
i thought it was basic knowledge when it comes to a shelter or habitat or wherever the animals are just looking means you re getting a new buddy
hahaha foolish you got conned hey i heard the lanky cat over there say just looking come brother our new home awaits
the cat is adorable but that roof is on its last leg üòâ
cat hm i think that‚Äôs the guy that‚Äôs been taking pics of me on reddit
"this reminds me of a song we sang in grade school oh senor don gato was a cat
on a high red roof don gato sat
he went there to read a letter meow meow meow
where the reading light was better meow meow meow twas a love note for don gato i adore you wrote the lady cat
who was fluffy white and nice and fat
there was not a sweeter kitty meow meow meow
in the country or the city meow meow meow
and she said she d wed don gato oh don gato jumped so happily
he fell off the roof and broke his knee
broke his ribs and all his whiskers meow meow meow
and his little solar plexus meow meow meow
ay caramba cried don gato then the doctors all came on the run
just to see if something could be done
and they held a consultation meow meow meow
about how to save their patient meow meow meow
how to save senor don gato but in spite of everything they tried
poor senor don gato up and died
and it wasn t very merry meow meow meow
going to the cemetery meow meow meow
for the ending of don gato when the funeral passed the market square
such a smell of fish was in the air
though his burial was slated meow meow meow
he became reanimated meow meow meow
he came back to life don gato"
i‚Äôm happy to see that roof pillow cat is still roof pillow cat d
i hope tge pillow does not fall off and i hope to god that that butiful cat has a home
goodness how many times this has been reposted still awesome though
the cat has become aware of your existence and is now plotting against you for not adding a bed alongside the pillow
love the updates we need to know how the cat and soccer ball are doing
could retrieve with a fishing rod amp reel little hook and a sinker pillow comes back to your pet
i feel like when the cat is not sleeping on the pillow it will fall down maybe because of wind and then someone will take it and it will be the end of those beautiful luxurious days for the cat
throw some treats from up there for more wireless bonding
i mean in terms of how updates go this is one that definitely could have been an email
you should take your pillow back wash it and drop it off the roof again
damn you re really milking every last drop of karma out of that cat eh
gonna have to move that pillow away from the edge soon
‚Äúsay the line u scalettas ‚Äù ‚Äú roof pillow cat‚Äù reddit cheers
i m invested in this cat now if anything ever happens to the pillow you must replace it
looks up sees person taking intel my position has been compromised cat
"damn man i thought it was a repost i was gonna downvote and then i saw the title
nice man like you are the only one who is keeping their pets known animals updated here"
i m such a miserable shitty person but when i see that someone put a pillow on a roof for the meow i m a big ol softy right away awwww he deserves it
this image has a lot of sexual tension between the cat and the picture taker
that is so awesome it make me want to go around the neighbourhood and flick pillows onto roof heisenberg style
ok but can we talk about the absolute mess that roof is
throw more pillows down to see how many cats you can collect
s he s moved that pillow since the last image c mon op we need a livestream
i want a pic of this cat everyday can we get a livestream going
thank you for not taking the pillow back i demand moar updates
roof top suite with luxurious pillow has kittens weeks later
can i offer to buy this cat a bed and then you can drop it there as well
i need one of these every week until we get a surprise of some sort
are you gonna go up there and change it soon bc it s gonna get moldy and we can t have him sitting on a moldy pillow
cat you there human i shall allow you to live when my kind takes over we need your skills to make these soft fluffy things to lay on i have never had such a comfy outdoor spot i approve of it and order you to make me more as i spread the word to my other cat friends of this roof bed thing
i hope we get more of these and if we get a different cat can we call it cat
this is the most foolproof way of automating karma farming set up webcam automatically take a photo every hours automatically post said photo to reddit karma karma karma karma karma karma
how is that pillow not soggy by now‚Äîdoes it not rain
get a basket and some rope yoi gonna wrangle a kitteh
cat no need for a water bowl people s your water collecting pipes are purfect mateüëè
i would pay for a triptych of high quality photos of this pillow cat if you know a photographer with good equipment maybe this could be a fundraiser via a local animal rescue where you live different sleep positions awake etc please keep sending these updates i think its amazing can you imagine finding a soft bed just for you
sevgili op bence bu kedi senin kaderin bu minno≈üa evini a√ß ve sonsuza kadar mutlu ya≈üayƒ±n
oh shit do you think they saw me licking myself earlier oh well fuck it what s done is done

wondering if there will be another cat trying to steal the spot
i like how the cats looking up yep i have adopted this pillow it is now mine
that cat has it made amp x b looking up like you were supposed to give me your bed too
aww it s still there i hope there won t be any rain so that the kitty cat will stay longer and longer
so what you re saying is you have adopted a new cat congrats
wait that s still there after all this time lol would have figured it would have gotten blown off by the wind or something by now
current status detected fr that s really cute aaaaaa
wish i had a dog your lucky dude give him a good pet for me
timmy is adorable may you have many many happy fun days to come
what breed is timmy he is the damn cutest thing ive ever seen
hello there timmy what a pleasure to meet you üêæ üíï üêæ
prepare for him to chew everything and i mean everything not to worry he‚Äôll grow out of it eventually lol
that little butt wiggle is all i need to love this dog good dog
"are you sure he s a dog looks like a teddy bear to me ‚ù§Ô∏è
he s sooo cute i wanna cuddle him so badly d"
oh no a cute lil baby bear timmy is the sweetest little pup i‚Äôve seen in a while
keep him away from poem for your sprog he keeps killing timmies
awww hi timmy we got our golden puppy that same weekend and his name is also tim
you are now going to understand why people love their fur friends as much and sometimes more than humans family etc their nicer and more loving hahaha congratulations
you ve probably figured out by now why puppies have to be so incredibly cute
white people will call their dog timmy and they kid astro
i always wonder how the owner discovered that their pet likes to slide or be thrown on the bed or tossed in the air or whatever
when this was posted last time i tried it with my cat she walked away from me and gave me a fuck you flick with her tail i disappointed her that day
this is torture youre torturing this cat he wants to run away s
another most welcome internet classic imagine the static electricity of that fur crackly
my brother had a ferret that liked to the gently tossed back in the grass kinda like this the ferret would run up wait we d toss him back a foot or so and he d come running back and wait animals are so funny sometimes
so sweet i really can‚Äòt understand why people wear shoes in the house
my cat flops down for me to spin her on the floor she meows and runs away like she doesn t like it but then she comes back for more xd
i appreciate that the human spins the kitty around so that the cat is sliding in the same direction as their fur
little does he knew that she just wants pets and wonders why he keeps pushing her away
my dad used to have a siamese cat when he was young the cat would walk up to him and he would sort of hold its skull in his hand and it would put its paws up on his forearms then my dad would spin kind of like you do to a kid when you re holding onto their arms the cat loved it and always came back for more
i had a cat like this he also liked to be spun in circles and fetch loved to fetch those little mouse cat toys he was awesome when he passed i decided i never wanted to have a pet ever again
lol what if that kitty just wanted to be pet and is just goddamn it wtf are you doing dude every time it walks back
i like how when the cat goes to lay down every time he s like like like dis
i need someone to make this into a perfect loop because i m too bad at stuff like this
poor cat just wants to lie down next to his human s feet but cruel person keeps pushing him away
my cat darling is like this but when we play fetch with her toys if i don t throw it within seconds f her dropping it she meows until i do lol
gawd damn it why do you keep pushing me i just want to show you this new lump on my fourth breats stop sthap this isn t a game john
i gently toss my cat on my bed from across the room and he always comes running back like this
how does one find out their cat likes doing stuff like that
aww dude my cat bubby used to like stuff like this on the wood floor now he‚Äôs old and just likes cuddles and food thanks for the nostalgia ü§ó
this is the things wives don t understand we won t know if they will like it until we try it at least once
just like the way this is being reposted again and again edit typo
sometimes you never know what your cat likes until you shuffleboard him across the room
i‚Äôve seen this clip so many times and i‚Äôm not complaining
omg i used to do this to my cat she hated it i thought she would like it she just gave me this wtf look
i think there are more effective ways to clean a floor
dang how long is this video kitty just keeps coming back for more lol
no jon that s not what i want jon you re not making it easy to either of us let s try that again goddamn jon i just want you to pet me
some say he is still squooshing the cat across the floor to this day
i want this type of relationship with my cat mine just cuddles and watches youtube videos
i used to launch my boy across the room onto a bed and he d come running back for more
it s all fun and games until you accidentally undertoss the cat into the wall
thank you thank you thank you for taking in these lovely caring creatures after what they‚Äôve been through
one of my favorite pets that i ever had was a greyhound from the tracks they‚Äôre the sweetest little noodle dogs
aw my old dog was brindled exactly like that man i miss that big booger
i have a pound doberman that also doesn t understand personal space it s cute but my god your a big dog
thinking of adopting an ex racing greyhound any tips
i ve been involved with a greyhound rescue group for going on years now he definitely understands it this is just his way of doing it amp x b thanks for adopting makes all the difference in the world to see a good dog go to a good home
i don t know why i thought greyhounds were smaller dogs that is not a small dog
well done these poor dogs get treated badly because they can run fast they are among the most timid and loving dogs again well done you
awww reminds me of my greyhound he passed years ago from bone cancer and i still miss him your guy girl is adorable
my greyhound that has never raced a day in his life does that too sometimes
after having two greys this will be the same at months
but mom i was already a lap dog i d do a lap or two every race day
lapdog exe has encountered a problem and needs to close we are sorry for the inconvenience
why am i crying at this this is so cute i can t stop please give me some dogs to hug i miss my babies so much whyyyyüò≠
hey op i play a game with my man called spot our stuff where is we see a possession of ours in any media you holler and point it out and get credit for noticing i think you have the same couch as we do you‚Äôre sitting in the little corner thing is one side a normal couch and the other ends in kind of a flat bench type thing no back of arm on the part do your cushions fall apart
congrats on the speed noodle we ve had our ex racer for years now she s and have fostered many of these good bois and girls before their forever homes feel free to pm me any questions you have we ve been through it all at this point
oh god i ve always wanted to adopt a greyhound i can t wait till i get mine
my mom s rescue greyhound took quite a few months to learn how to dog now he s a fun loving sweetheart
thought the title said adopted girlfriend was confused for a moment
i‚Äôm sure your deerwolf will get the hang of it eventually
tell him he‚Äôs doing a great job and that i‚Äôm proud of him
i had a brindle greyhound that was an adopted racing dog we had to put him down because of cancer a few days ago and i miss him dearly he was a truly wonderful kind and goofy dog i hope you have as much fun with him as i did with mine watching these dogs run is one of the most incredible things i ve ever seen
your greyhound has the same coat as my mountain cur beautiful pup
he looks like a dog i met a little while ago named winner
looks to me like he‚Äôs figured it out just fine congratulations on your new king of the couch they‚Äôre great dogs
i ve had a couple of greyhound rescues before it s the oddest thing the instantly take to couches like they were trained to do so
space coast florida by chance tons of greys around here after racing got outlawed
consider yourself lucky mine won‚Äôt climb onto my lap but i wish it would
my brother adopted one a few years ago dog is super silly and just adorable really good with his kids too
that‚Äôs beautiful unfortunately for my friend he adopted one and it turned out to be an expensive nightmare
what is it called when the fur has those sort of stripes on it i think it looks super cool
does yours howl when you re not home i used to live next door to a rescued greyhound where the owner neglected it and left it for hours at a time inside must ve been a mess and all it did was howllllll at decibels day and night i love animals but seriously had fantasies about silencing that hound glad you rescued yours hope it doesn t have that kind of separation anxiety
they are some of the most wonderful loving dogs on earth but they are the worst at cuddling all bones and joints and funny angles and such
you‚Äôd think he‚Äôd be a sunglasses fast learner yyyeeaahhhhhhh
bless my uncle used to rescue greyhounds sweetest babes
i think it understands perfectly what being a lap dog is all about
i used to have two retired greyhounds they make fantastic pets surprisingly lazy and relaxed and super quiet
how are they im considering adopting a ex racer i have another dog
okay i was doing laps before now i m doing just one lap am i doing it right
does he run circles a lot a man would bring in his two racing dogs and they would run around the building for what felt like an hour in circles
hahaha greyhounds are hilarious despite their dragon breath they re still awesome dogs
my family got a barrel racing horse when i was young and it couldn t do anything but run at full speed
is getting these dogs a seasonal this time of year my neighbor just got one from florida last week and also heard of another friend getting one this week as well
i‚Äôm laughing out loud at the train station lovey baby
greyhound found his bed will that be cash or charge
that adjusting to retirement period can be stressful but man they become the sweetest most adorable things ever when they come out of their shell
have you bought your greyhound it s own couch yet or is he still using yours lol
i dunno seems like she has it down perfectly i mean that‚Äôs how my lb dog sits on me even though she‚Äôs never run a race in her life and doesn‚Äôt really fit in my lap either
i want to adopt one so badly but have cats and small lb dogs
i met a greyhound that looks just like her yesterday beautiful colors
what an obnoxious laughing noise i just made thank you for that
looks to me like he s wondering why your not smelling his but
most of the grey hounds who come to the dog park i go to start with muzzles their prey drive was encouraged from a young age and it can take a while to get them used to being around small dogs it is unnerving to see a dog in a muzzle but the first time you see a dog fresh off the track pecking the hell out of a smaller animal through a muzzle you will be thankful
awww i wish mine would do this he‚Äôs very anti jumping up on anything though if i sit on the floor with him he‚Äôll put his head in my lap but he won‚Äôt get on the couch no matter how hard i try üòû
gosh mine took six months just to sleep on his own bed rather than the floor almost a year to understand he can get on the couch whenever he wants four years later he s much more relaxed but still don t eat around people and gets nervous about the most random stuff love him so much
i have an ex racing greyhound who‚Äôs name is theo he was sent to a kill shelter at years old because he was performing poorly and didn‚Äôt seem interested in running thankfully a organization focused on bringing greyhounds to midwestern shelters rescued him and we adopted him let me tell you theo is such a big sweetheart he never bites is friendly to both humans and dogs to a fault sometimes as not all dogs are friendly back and loves laying around and cuddling even if he can smush you it‚Äôs quite unfortunate that he was going to be killed just because he was a bad racer shortly after we adopted theo we realized why he was a bad runner at such a young age most greyhounds are let off the track at around years turns out during one of his early races he broke his toe instead of taking him to the vet and getting it fixed the people taking care of the greyhounds just let it set that way as a result theo was in pain walking on his paw and it eventually got infected we had to get it amputated and his paw is still very sensitive in conclusion screw greyhound racing tracks and i hope that the few left are shut down
my friend s family adopted greyhounds and they were the sweetest dogs ever they did the same thing one of them the biggest of course would just stand in front of the tv and bark at you if you didn t make room for him on the loveseat üê∂üõãÔ∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
do you live in fl i really hope all these lovable dogs get a good home
awwwwww he she was probably caged so much that they re just super grateful to be able to be near the person who saved them and have the chance to become a part of your family how utterly adorable
it‚Äôs well known that cats dance their way to maturity
did anyone else start wiggling their shoulders left and right
love it when your cat starts rapidly shrinking back in to a kitten
you can see the change in the eyes when it s no longer a kitten and becomes a cat
from flawwfball to miaowgnificent arsehole in seconds
the video audio is way too loud also why would you have voices extremely disturbing ones i might add screaming names in such a video and why does this have so many upvotes this is seriously confusing me
that cat has a fancy way of scooting it s butt on the floor
it looks like it s morphing unnaturally and it would be scary if it wasn t a cute kitty
i wish cats eyes kept the bright white outline that they have when they re young rather than turning into a more off white yellow outline as adults
i was hoping it would continue until the cat was nothing but a skeleton
the fact that it kinda morphs to the next photo is pretty disturbing cute overall though
i‚Äôve watched this on youtube hundreds of times i love it
so cats when old just become a kitten and begin again nice to see the lives aspect
how old was the kitty at the oldest fluffiest point is he still with us hopefully this wasn t the kitty s entire life but if it was a long life that is a pretty good record dedication
cute cute cute cute cute cute cute cute cure cute cute cute cute cute cute cute
interesting how the color of eye changes as they grow up
there‚Äôs an odd middle ground where cats are starting to mature but are still phasing out of their adolescence and that‚Äôs personally my favorite stage of a cat
i don t like how the last one was suddenly a lot skinnier
can someone tell me the app to create a video from daily photos
would love to see another version of this where the eyes are always centered
i had this playing at the same time as srv s pride amp joy and it synced up nicely
god it took forever to grow into those fucking ears
cant believe they put that cat in a room for its whole life that s just cruel smh
but if you re thinkin about my baby it don t matter if you re black or white
i imagine this what it looks like when a pok√©mon evolves
how did this cat catch benjamin button disease halfway through its life
shit i didn t know they just turned back into kittens again i put my cat down for no reason
the ears grow first then the rest of the cat catches up
i read the title as a kitten throwing up and was like ewww why
please note how like most mammals the eyes stay the same size throughout development it‚Äôs super cool and is why ‚Äúbabies‚Äù appear to have such big cute eyes
i wish it would show the tail my tortie cat‚Äôs tail got super long over what seemed to be overnight one day she came waltzing into my bedroom and her tail was longer than her body and sticking straight up in the air
lies i know of no cat who can sit still in front of camera like that so many times
is it unusual that i find adult cats cuter than kittens
honestly when it sped up at the end i was hoping for an irish jig
this confirms my feelings that still little but not a baby kitten is the best type of cat too bad it is so temporary üò≠
this cat was moving to the rhythm of the song i was listening to
it s more amazing how close you can get this cat to sit each time i know you re doing transitions between them but jesus i m lucky if i can find my cat half the time let alone get them to pose
but why was the cat kept in that one spot it‚Äôs whole life smh
the cat he approaches shifting cat there are many a thousand billion souls
this reminds me of that time willow tried to turn fin raziel back into a human
what type of transitions were used to make that effect
was listening to without me by eminem and why the hell did this sync weirdly well with the flow
i really thought that that cats shrink when they grow old in this video
has anyone tried watching this with scatman playing in the back it works im the catman ski ba bop ba dop bop
holy shit i was listening to the chorus of are we still friends by tyler the creator and it lined up exactly with each new time lapse
i like when they lose their derp eyes mine is aged at sec now and very similar to that one but darker love him much he s a great friend to have around love them and show them who s the boss like a gentle dad and cats are amazing companion
this is awesome what do you call this effect it looks like it is not just separate frames stitched to a video but rather like the frames morph into one another
dont get me wrong cats are definitely cute but this timelapse was kind of creepy
cats seem to be the only animals that do not grow less cute
most people never see a true adult male cat i m not advocating not getting them fixed it s just they are a much different animal both behaviorally and physically
i like to move it move it he likes to move it move it
so that s where tina from bob s burgers got her dance
he looks just like that gif of the little kid in the stands at the sports game pulling his shirt up
no diggity just came on my work radio as i scrolled to this post it s so perfect
i read that as weird otter day the dancing otter helped sell it
my mom had a pet skunk when she was a kid it didn‚Äôt have its scent gland removed but it trusted them enough that the family was never sprayed
sorry for the confusion but she is not a pet ivy was released back to the wild in june of i was working at an animal rehab centre in british columbia and got the pleasure of raising little skunks
silly question but how do you ‚Äútrain‚Äù one not to spray you
love the play wrestling especially her expression at the end i am fierce nope ivy you re just a lil stinker i really envy you your job
many years ago i did have a pet skunk descented of course his name was ozymandias nickname ozzy they really are fun and friendly animals to have around but they require a lot of care definitely do your research before going for it also check your local laws as they are not legal to own in some areas op thanks for the great work you re doing and keep it up
nothing in this whole world is as cute as a baby skunk they win the whole thing
it appears your cat has walked under a hanging paint brush you d better wash it off before an amorous frenchman tries to seduce her
it might sound weird but her butt looks like a skull or voldemort
does like the exact little movements as the one in bambi haha
yeah cute but i think after accidently scaring it a few times i would be sick of my shit stinking
wow honestly i never thought that a skunk could be this cute
look at her crotch to see a monkey s face that is the first thing i noticed
man what if it farted on you right then though that would have to fuck up your day
did she or any of the troop stink you during these months
they are adorable all i know is thumper from bambi ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
honest question do skunks fart and is it worse than a dog fart
i mean he s adorable but the fact of the matter is with his lil butthole exposed like that you are quite literally staring down the barrel of a gun
her mind was blown at the sight of her own butt hole
holding a skunk like that is like staring down the barrel of a gun to see if it s loaded
i don t see a single scream at own ass comment i m disappointed
man first post and you got k upvotes killin it already
this makes me miss my skunkie baby being so little üò≠üò≠ loki is over year old now equally as cute not equally as little gah enjoy the skunk parent life
oh my gosh my dad would love one of these babies that is all he ever talked about ever since i was small
i waited a long time for the thing to load was not disappointed
are you using me as a a damn pillow again sleeeep my pretty
more minutes of this and i m gonna get mad not my fault this is happening
what the heck what you doing everything ok your not pissed are you awww that feels good right there the progression in the dogs eyes is beautiful
that doggo is worried kitter is like nah dude just roll with it
how do you decide whether you cat and dog or dog and cat i would have always gone with dog and cat weird thought weird question is it favouritism
awe please give these two some love from me when you get home
your dog doesn t look like a willing participant in these cuddles
don t know if a video has ever made me quite so sleepy comfy
i love kelvin and joule you are my favorite ig account to follow
that final yawn mmmh sign of a good cozy afternoon nap
hey man can i sleep here just need a quick cat nap sure dude today definitely has been ruff for all of us
my heart breaks my mother s dog had the exact same face ears and snout what type of dog is this
dog uh excuse me what are you doing cat dog uh hello cat dog ah fuck it i‚Äôm too old to care you can lay there
he is waiting to see in what kind of mood the cat was in he totally didn‚Äôt trust that peaceful walk over at all
wish my dog would let this happen and the cat for that matter dog has separation anxiety so having the cat come cuddle him might help though he would probably just chase him round the house breaking things in the progress
the cat came to lie down in a warm place and doesn t care that there happens to a dog in that spot
that is too tame my dogs lick each other s asses and not even in secret
dog ahhh what are you doing cat shhh just let it happen dog yeah ok ah luxury
wish my pets would be friendly with each other months and they still cant be in the same room as each other
i always wondered if dogs feel any pain when cats knead them
also i always thought cats with collars looked so cute
cuddling your lover after you just found out she s an assassin
i eagerly await additional footage episodes please and thank you
i like to colour matching was that planned pup looks a bit worried for a sec i wonder if he‚Äôs had a random smack from the cat to soften him up
i love how the dog is like is this nap cuddles or needle cuddles
years of darkness earthquakes volcanoes the dead rising from the grave human sacrifice this mass hysteria
i wonder if the kneading is a stress relief thing for cats
i love him for i am a dog i also fear him for he is a cat
your pet colors frankly all your color choices coordinate quite nicely kudos
why does cat do this is it a leftover habit since they was a new born and try to press for milk
not so much cuddles as much as that cat telling that dog hey you re my seat
the dog looks so concerned ‚Äúwh what‚Äôre you doing clawing to kill oh oh ah yes that feels nice‚Äù
i think that demonstrates who is the boss when you are gone
i think the dog is aware that the cat is a cat and therefore bipolar
if i learned anything from reddit it means your cat is going to try and eat your dog one night so if you see your cat starving itself eat it first
don‚Äôt know bout you but this secret relationship is givin‚Äô me flashbacks of some lannister‚Äôs
that dog is really contemplating life at the end i mean he‚Äôs gettin deep or so it looks could just be thinking ‚Äúbark woof grrrr‚Äù idk but he‚Äôs def thinking about something
you mean between your cat and your cat s dog by the looks of it
dauchshund lab mix looks identical to mine except color
they look like they‚Äôre stressing about their secret relationship and what they‚Äôre gonna do with the baby
lmao my lab makes that same exact face when the cats get close to her but she s too much of a spazz to let them sleep near her also i wonder what s he saw at that made the little ears perk up
set up webcam to record dawg s complete defeat ftfy
my dog tries to watch whatever is on my laptop there is no way id trust her with it alone üòÇ
half way through the video cat just had to check to make sure nobody was watching can t let other people noticing but cat needs love too
the cat looks like he s sitting down to play a dog shaped piano in the first bit
aww my long dog loves cats cats don‚Äôt like him so much to cute so see a long dog find a friend even in secret
i recognized that viszla face a mile away have a lab viszla mix
that‚Äôs a very tentative cuddle it‚Äôs like neither wants to admit they actually want to cuddle
i m legitimately curious if animal rights activists think of this as a violation of privacy
thank god you live in a state where you don‚Äôt need your animals permission
damn kneading cats hurt good for that dog for putting up with it
while the cat was kneading on the dogs back it looked like it was playing the piano
"a miracle oh it was beautiful meowgical
and all the birds in the trees well they d be singing so happily"
your dog s reaction in a nutshell as time progresses what is this cat doing snuggles with the dog ok this is awkward don t make eye contact am i being violated right now i think i like it yeah give me all your lovin scratches
that dog was skeptical at first that cat tortures that dog slot
the cat looks just like my kitty my cat s name is cooper but i call him coopie
that poor pup is just waiting for the swipe of the paw
that dog looks like he s thinking about his life choices
dog is this rape amp x b nah what is rape anyway i smell asses as hello
they know in spite of their differences that they re in this together lt
the look on that adorable dog s face is priceless ah shit ok as usual a cat being a cat just does what it pleases
cat knowing the camera is filming look i love doggo so much dog confused by inconsistencies of cat typical actions suspiciously watches cat until eventual acceptance of impending swat bite
that dog is contemplating the universe before he says fuckit and lays back down
the dog looks like he just came to the realization that he is also the cat‚Äôs pet
which camera do you have looking to get one for my dog
your dog is in an abusive relationship and you now have evidence
your pupper misses you mr kitty pulling up clutch with the cuddles
you re dog doesn t seem to know how to handle the situation
for a minute there the dog wasn t sure what her true intentions were
the entire time the dog looks like he‚Äôs in fear of his life
do you think they like each other because they are the same color
you‚Äôre usually such an asshole but you‚Äôre petting me nicely guess i should just sit here dog probable
the look om the dog s face like you here to love me or hate me ok i like
the dog is like ummm ok i guess this is a thing now
cat rubs dog yes ohhh that s good oh yeahhh dog thinking please make her stop human were are you
what kind of dog is this my parents have one which looks so similar but dont know what breed
yah you always wonder what their secret life is when you are not there now you know
i m pretty sure if you offered this as a free streaming service you could single handedly cost the economy s of billions of dollars in productivity
this doesn t feel like a cuddle it feels like a hostage video just remember what these claws did last time you tried to leave
i miss my two wild lads q q here take this onion ninja induced cookie üç™üç™
dog i wish mom dad was home cat i m here for your warmth
that is one bored dog i guess at least he has a cat to keep him company i understand people want dogs but perhaps not if you have to leave it alone during the days imagine that life they don t have books or music or computers or anything to keep themselves occupied all they can do is lie there and silently wait the human equivalent is solitary confinement i just don t think it s right to get a dog unless you can have someone with it most of the time
the cat gets warmth and the dog gets pets happy couple
my favorite part is how they don t make eye contact
dog excuse wat doing cat starts snuggin dog chills hard to spiky butt massage
the oomans will not approve we must keep this between us
that s not a cuddle that s a powerplay look at the kneading with claws out if that doesn t say i m superior i don t know what does
someone may have already asked but did they grow up together that is so sweet
i like how the dog looks a little confused at first
omg that is so adorable the way he is kneading the dog i love orange tabbies
what webcam are you using that resolution is amazing
my cats will be asleep on each other while im gone but for some reason the moment i leave they disperse
what‚Äôs your instagram name i swear i follow you on instagram
i love the way the cat tries to get as close to the dog as possible before his kneading begins absolutely adorable
adorable i have a webcam for my doggies but it doesn‚Äôt record which one is this
awwwwwww my puppy does the huge signs too ive had to leave her with my parents since i got a new job in a city i miss your every hour of every day
honest actual question do they do this when you re home asking as a fellow cat dog owner
not only am i gushing about the cute snuggles happening i think i am equally excited to see there hasn t been a single comment about something wrong with either animal haha
the dog is like um hi seconds later he s like oh yea that s nice
your dog looks like hunsley from curious george and this is darling and i love your living room and especially the blanket
if they were having a conversation i wonder what they would be saying
cat ‚Äúbut i‚Äôll totally flip out and scratch you for no reason later ‚Äù
its a strange little pack but you take love where you can find it
how d you get your dog and cat the exact same color
this is perfect ammo for convincing my so to get a pair when we adopt
i just want to give them headpats nice username btw op
looks like the cat is perfecting her space before lying down
if all goes right or wrong like in the office you angela will find them mating on the webcam
the best part is the cat looking out of the window to make sure no one catches it
either your cat is declawed or your dog is very patient
i wonder how many other cute moments the fbi man has seen
love how the cat looks like he s tapping into the secrets of the universe while the dog doesn t seem to care
oh wow that‚Äôs terrible my heart goes out to you and you hubby i do have one human kiddo but our fur kids have always been her siblings they are family and just as important as human members i hope you are able to remember the love good moments and amazing lives i‚Äôm sure you gave them all over time üíï
your cat looks like the scene of jack nicholson frozen in the snow in the shining
our calico grooms me and will hold my head still if i try to move
he s a handsome boy my old lady loves to groom my hair too if i m on the couch and take my hair out of its bun to readjust she comes running over and just starts burying her face in it
my cat does the same thing only he drools a lot so i end up with crusty hair lol
he looks like those tranquil surreal japanese paintings
give him lots of love from me he seems like such a precious boy
awwww my fat male tabby does this too he‚Äôll occasionally stretch and end with his paw on my shoulder like he‚Äôs making a move on me in the movie theatre
he looks so young and healthy i bet he has many years ahead isn t it just the best when they re going out of their way just to hang with you they want your company it s just the sweetest thing
my old man just passed away on friday just short of these are some of the best years of life that you ll have with him
we have one that bonded with me while bottle feeding her for those first weeks unfortunately her momma passed after birth she‚Äôs about now and does the same thing sits on the back of the couch or chair i‚Äôm in and grooms my hair
my cat tries to groom my hair but he only gets one lick in before he realizes that my hair is over a foot long and he s not gonna be able to handle that
my sofas arranged in an l configuration look exactly like that at the top and three cats have turned those squishy tops into perfect cat beds like your cat has they all love movie night when we are in there with them sharing the sofas i have some cat beds scattered around but nothing beats the top of the sofa in popularity
these cat posts are making me sad but the rules state i can t say i m sad oh god oh fuck
he is a very dapper boy i too used to have a boy that liked to groom me i called him my feline hairdresser the way he d tug at my hair the best boys
my cat is yo rn and also loves just sitting next to her favorite humans and in fact anyone who comes home she s more expressive now compared to before and makes it point to come and interact with every human in the house i love how the personalities of cat mature with age
he looks so freaking happy i hope one day i will find a buddy so smiley
doesn t he fly away or get scared of people if it was me i would be super nervous to bring a bird to a public place
my guy whistles the andy griffith song and says ‚Äúpretty bird ‚Äù but will not stay on my shoulder in all fairness though i have dogs and cats too so he can‚Äôt be out of the cage unattended i wish he would hang with me like yours does
i d be nervous about bringing my little dude out without a harness without a lot of free flight training and even then because of all the raptors in the area but still such a cute little dude
i once walked out my front door with my cockatiel on my shoulder wings unclipped and thankfully he chirped at me so i could quietly say oh shit to myself and slowly walk back inside my little nearly year old old man doesn t like coming out of his cage any more but he was a great friend for years when i still lived at home
i have a very young quaker parrot and i m hoping to get him to the point that we can walk around outside together like this although he s already pretty attached to my shoulder and when he gets uncomfortable he tries to hide in my neck so i think it ll be relatively easy to get him there i m just nervous about it
i don‚Äôt believe i‚Äôve ever witnessed pure love on a bird‚Äôs face before
blue merle bull dog is it aussie with bull dog or what what is it other than very cute
looks like a english bulldog australian shepard mix my god it s so cute i had no idea i needed this combo in my life until now
omfg the way it‚Äôs entire body amp wrinkles jiggle as it turns it‚Äôs head
coat coloring and ear shape indicate custom dog aussie bull dog the merle link provided by blondeambitchion shows the coloring but not the ear shape so i dont believe those are bulldog ears and therefore not just an unusual coat i also believe in ghosts so grain of salt may be required
ooof the health issues that dog is gonna face growing up
holy crap that s one of the cutest pups i ve ever seen
i know it‚Äôs cruel to continue breeding english bullies but they are the dang cutest dogs on the planet
my bull baby died outside in her favorite spot last year she was years old be swwet to your baby
what an adorable wrinkle i want to smoosh their face and give them all the skritches and pets
i ve never seen a bulldog with that fur pattern before she s so beautiful üòç
and this is how i end up with another bull dog ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
they are adorable and they re certainly excellent little climbers
are you able to house train and raise a raccoon asking for a friend myself i‚Äôm my own friend
meet rocket sprocket lock it got it shock it mock it amp rabbit
i miss our old house because every year this momma raccoon would bring her baby raccoons to the porch for treats i know i probably should not have been feeding them but they were always so adorable i had to
it‚Äôs like a baby raccoon infestation it‚Äôs the cutest infestation ever
come here you i am going to give you rabies just joking
i was hoping the camera would pan over to a shocked and confused looking cat wondering what happened to its home
if you want a pet you can truly enjoy which will not constantly demand of your attention which can be trusted not to destroy things the moment you are distracted which is not under certain circumstances smarter than you are which is not absolutely without a conscience and utterly committed to utilizing every mg of energy it can conjure which when grown is not an absolute unit with opposing thumbs then you do not want a raccoon don t do it guarantee you will regret it
have to say i just had surgery and so am on a few meds at the moment scrolling past this i somehow thought this was a video of a robot rubbing it s belly at first i was very confused and was pleased to find i was mistaken i appreciate the pile of cuteness
i cannot even conceive the chaos they re capable of unintentionally wreaking that room needs to be locked down in order to prevent the spread of utter pandemonium don t get me wrong they re adorable and i love watching videos of them but at the same time knowing what they can do makes me cringe with apprehension
that looks like a helluva lotta baylisascaris procyonis
i stopped on the side of the road a few weeks ago to help three baby racoons across the road no mother in sight one was acting really weird and attacked my boot twice the other two ran from me but the one was mad as hell i was trying to help
they look cute but they smell bad and they‚Äôre super rough when they climb on you
that‚Äôs basically the summit of mt everest right now
one of those just caused of damage in my attic would not recommend
if rascaling were a verb these guys would be doing it rascaling around like a boss or a dozen or so bosses
what impressed me most was that for the first seconds of the clip almost all of them were sitting still and looking at the camera
i counted at first and then the camera panned down and there was i think then another or went up and i think i saw another hidden at the bottom how many were there
your dad looks like he is going to kill the game maker for letting katniss win the hunger games
i ve always thought of some animals as being really strange to find in the wild hedgehogs being a great example of this don t they need really specific things to survive like a heat lamp and specialized diet i clearly don t know anything about hedgehogs but yeah interesting to find one in the wild very cool
solved rae dawn chong s reddit username is actually crachmilson s
i saw this and thought ‚Äúi didn‚Äôt know tommy chong lived in the u k ‚Äù absolute dead ringer
there s a sprinkle of anthony hopkins in there too people
i thought bob weir was holding a hedgehog for some reason
i feel like he looks like a cross between tommy chong and mark hamill
how has no one mentioned the fact that op s dad is tommy chong
your dad looks like a mix between willie nelson and kenny rogers which is not a bad thing in my opinion cool pic
can you ask your dad if he‚Äôs ‚Äúholding‚Äù you know for a friend
well i clicked this post to say this isn t this the same dad as the one who had the baby bird in his hand
everyone s saying tommy chong am i the only one who sees year old charles boyle
my first thought this man has done acid in his past
your father looks like the kind of old person i want to be
he‚Äôs absolutely scrumptious and i would love to cuddle him the hedgehog too
your dad looks like odin without the eyepatch that makes you thor my friend
sir anthony hopkins and steve buscemi‚Äôs hedge hogs obsessed love child
when the hell did albert einstein get a fucking hamster i mean a wild sonic
is your dad a druid who brews a potion which grants super strength for like an hour per consumption of a sip
by the looks of it he managed to get all fingers up its arse well done sir well done
my dude i hate to be the bearer of bad news but baby hedgehogs stay in the same place alone to camoflage themselves until their mother returns
your dad looks more to me like old luke skywalker than old luke skywalker
heyyy man i m so highhh this apple looks like a calculator duuuuude
til tommy chong is half chinese i always thought he was latino lol
does your dad moonlight as a wizard and go on adventures with dwarves and hobbits
your dad kind of looks like anthony hopkins the hedgehog is cute too
just threw ups to everyone who was here to say the same thing i came here to say
i wish my dad looked that interesting mine looks absent
he looks like if tommy chong and anthony hopkins had a baby
everyone down here saying your dad looks like tommy chong but the first thing i thought of was skinny santa claus
cool looking dad you have he looks like tommy chong
‚Äúcaught me in the bathroom with a pair of panty hose‚Äù
your dad was a garden gnome that became a real man when your mum kissed him and this hedgehog is his old friend
your dad actually looks a lot like a guy i bought a wheelchair from at savers
okay the real question is where do i need to live in order to find hedgehogs in my backyard
i thought something was seriously wrong with his hands there for a moment
baby hedgehogs are so fun i had a african pigme hedgehog like this one as a pet for years she was a cool pet she had a wheel that she would run on for hours and hours and hours and hours
oh it s cry s mcbitches alot amp x b look up chris pontius wearing a bullet ant glove if you need any more proof that this guy is a pune
i love how you can see the ocelot clearly empathizing with the guy
best interaction i have seen with a wildlife expert
the crab after scaring the ocelot is just like i am the king
when u realize the ocelot jumped because of the man s hand is coming to his face and scared him not because he worried about the man
all i can think of is that scene in milo and otis cautionary tale
are ocelots this friendly it looks like they ve been buds for years
now that s a sweet lookin dog i ll tell you h what üòç
that s no dog that s a top secret government robot made to spy on you codename dog
did lady bird help convince your wife she looks very convincing
lol there s a restaurant in atlanta called lady bird highly popular with dogs unsurprisingly
are you saying you couldn t have gotten the puppy otherwise
not gonna lie i first read larry bird and cute puppy btw
you teach her to dance or your a bad pup dad jk but you should still teach her
do y all ever think people are out there adopting animals just for the upvotes or am i the only one not randomly bringing home animals every other day
thats a cute puppy but if that aint the stupidest name ive heard
the actual convincing ‚Äúhey wife we need a puppy‚Äù ‚Äúyes‚Äù
our girl‚Äôs name is ladybird too love a dog named bird
his face says i am not sure who the good boy is buy i promise you if you love me enough i can be the goodest of the boys
my childhood dog who passed about a year ago was names ladybird johnson reminded me of her
i tell ya h what that s a good looking dog almost as beautiful as propane
sweet doggo you don‚Äôt happen to sell propane and propane accessories do you
he is going to be a great dog for a long time but sadly back problems will cut his career short really a tragedy
not trying to overreact or anything but i d literally die for lady bird
illtellyouwhatmanthatdangoldogiscuteasheckanditgoesbarkbarkandlikesthemdangolpatsonthehead
‚Äúoh sorry mr hill i mean we‚Äôre going to have to put laaaaaaydybird down mr hill ‚Äù
my parents dog named lady bird died this year she was a great dog and i hope yours will do the namesake proud
you are either a fan of king of the hill president lyndon b johnson or both
please tell me your son is named bobby and that you sell propane accessories
i can t tell if that s the real lady bird or the pretend lady bird luanne got from the pound
well she s all the dog you d ever want the kind you like to flaunt and feed a puppy chow dinner always knows her place jumping on your legs lickin you in the face she s a winner she s a lady
i can‚Äôt believe i didn‚Äôt think of this name for my pupper
laaaaaaady bird really gotta put the emphasis in the a
with a face like that im sure the convincing party was easy
why do i have a feeling you convinced her to get a new puppy just so you could use that king of the hill reference
aside i ve only seen today years old like times ever all within the last couple of weeks let s not make this a thing the phrase makes no sense maybe it showed up in a tv show or pop song recently i like the funny doggy pictures
jesus christ people pets shou√¶d be contained in moving vehicles or does safety mean nothing to anyone anymore
please make sure you do not have your dog in front of an airbag it can kill them if you get into even a minor fender bender cute pic though
at first i though you meant the dream catcher that is right in front of his third eye
came here to say pupholder only to find i ve never had a unique thought
oh i thought op meant the spirit catcher cause nobody besides soccer moms know what those are for
the only problem is that they don t make them big enough for great danes üòÇ
‚Äútoday years old‚Äù is funny because that‚Äôs not how you usually describe your age i get it
as cute as these things look i hate it when people put their dog in the car without securing them in any way things can go wrong even if you don t crash let s just say you quickly swerve or brake and your flies into your face how does that sound not safe
i only have one and it‚Äôs officially designated snoot holder
is that a cd based phone holder how have your experiences been with them wanted to get one but they look pretty flimsy
at first without scrolling down i thought you were talking about the dreamcatcher infront of pups face keeping bugs off lmfao
today years old get it guys its funny üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
a dreamcatcher in a car driver needs to rethink their habits
and you sleep in your car poor bastard hopefully one day you will get a home and you can put that dream catcher in the window of your bedroom where it belongs unless you sleep in your car
hope your car isn t moving with the dog sitting there he should be belted or at least crated in a cage
he s been watching and now he s learning how drive to the car right throttle left brake he s got this
you joke but i dated a woman from long island who was extremely grateful when i showed her the night mirror flippy thingy she was like
in my car they are watertight so they also serve as an impromptu water bowl ask my dog how we know
now i know why there is cup paw holders at the front and two at the back
i only saw the top half of the picture and thought i would finally find the secret to dream catchers
bad idea unless you like the idea of your dog being smashed into the windscreen in a crash
well damn i‚Äôve been using them to put my cups in stupid me
cute pic but the today years old meme needs to die yesterday
what is that rectangular box like thingy on the center stack
what kind of dog is this it looks like mine which was a rescue and we have no idea of her heritage
i thought you were talking about the dream catcher for a second
my doggo would be to scared that he would get stuck in them
but why is there a tight belt around the dog s neck along with a collar at least that s what it looks like
my doggos approve adding to the new car requirements list
dude look at that focus the dog is also staring intently
before i scrolled down i thought you were talking about the dream catcher and your hunting dog was using it as a scope
my dog took a big ol‚Äô deuce in my cup holder once lol
last weekend i noticed that my sister s new boyfriend a woodworker had cut two wooden plugs to put in his cup holders when i asked him about them he said it was so that our family dog could hang out with him without hurting her legs if he hits the brakes i like this one
this also applies to those side mounted door stop springs they are meant for dogs to play with
i have the same car what s that thing in the cd player
ok cool but is that a belt why does the dog have a belt
why do people put dreamcatchers on their rear view mirror do you sleep in your car
not gonna lie i thought you had a mini basketball goal on his muzzle
i have a dream catcher that looks just like that hanging in the exact same spot in my car lol
could you cancerous people not use those stupid per owner terms it s so annoying and stupid like your pets
you should put some hot water in it let him get a spa feel d
ridiculously cute but i‚Äôm especially in love with that pineapple collar üòç
this is in no way safe you re clearly in drive so even if you re stopped you aren t stopped safely if your foot were to slip off of the brake for any reason the resulting slam of the brake pedal would be enough of a jolt to possibly injur your dog with his feet there please no one do this keep your puppers secured during transport i don t think any of us want to see our beloved animals injured due to negligence in summary seatbelts are good for people and our furry friends please use
my dog would love it if our cupholders were like this
i‚Äôve always wanted dog shit on the bottom of my water bottle
y is there a belt around the dogs neck and a collar is the real question to be asked
my mom s van has a collapsible middle section with four cup holders the australian shepherd i had growing up would put each of her feet in all four them as we drove i was always terrified that it would break under her weight it never happened
my pup lays in the passenger seat and puts his snout in the cup holder it‚Äôs multifunctional
full power to main borkdrives activate turbo zoomies
i have one of those couches with cup holders between the seats and my puppy likes to use it as a bone holder there‚Äôs one bone she has that is shaped exactly right so that it won‚Äôt move at all when she‚Äôs chewing it she‚Äôs resourceful
totally reasonable amp logical dogs make sense we could and do learn a lot from cats amp dogs i m today years old every day like peter pan
my newly adopted dog has the same collar looks good on this dog too
man i wanna take a whiff of those dog paws and then chase that dog around a fenced in backyard so he doesn‚Äôt run into the street
hah my dogs paws would never fit in those all three of my dogs have monster sized paws
at least you won t have any bad dreams when you are sleeping and driving
that s why they come heated cooled in fancier vehicles now
"i like that ‚Äútoday years old‚Äù
consider that line stolen by me"
aw i named my orange cat butters she ll be this year
so cute looks just like a little downs kitten someone i know has also named butters üíñ precious little bean
aww fuck sooooo cute had to comment make sure you let butter knows
i used to have a little orange cream and white cat named butters this post made me smile thanks
being too far away to gently pet butters makes me sad you must do it for me
butters go to your room you re grounded for being too cute
i too have a butters but his name is butters because he is a dumb as south park butters
what a cutie pa tootie i‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs such a little angel his eyes are too freakin cute
has multiple posts between now and last year i never post but look at my cute cat
thats awesome one of my buddies got a cat like years ago and named it butters lots of times at his place you would hear him yell god dammit butters
i spy another cat in the background who dat orange kittens are gorgeous
i had i cat named butters he was our first cat in ok came to us as a kitten right out of the woods he grew to be an old man as my dad would say before he disappeared into those woods and didn t come back
please tell me you have a female cat named margerine
your cat is absolutely adorable and i love the name of it butters is one of my favorite south park characters
i‚Äôm sure i‚Äôm not the first to say how much i love the name
please snuggle butters a little bit more than usual for me okay
not to be over dramatic but i would die for butters
so you‚Äôre saying you‚Äôve been hiding butters from us you monster
usually i don‚Äôt care for cats but holy hell butters is the cutest thing i have ever seen he made my night thank you üòäüëçüèª
updoot for butters i have a yorkie named butters the best is my so is mexican so her parents call him mantequilla
i has a butters hes a fluffy years and pounds of furrry
according to your post history you are no lurker at all these titles are so cringe
the first thing that came up in my mind was happy feet
this is one time that giving a cap full wouldn t be mean those kids who s parents would let them have soda were mean just giving a cap full
rtgeekforever exe has stopped working from cuteness overload
don t drown the poor thing put the water in the cap and let them drink from that
i feel like there must be a more efficient way to do this
what a stupid fuck the person in the video and op for posting it fuck you both
chickens don t drink the same way that we do do not give water to chickens this way a chicken‚Äôs tongue while effective for pushing food back is not effective for pushing water back when we swallow we close our mouths and let our throat do the work a chicken has to open and close its mouth rapidly while it tilts its head up to get the water to go down its throat
just let it drink from a puddle or the bottle cap the person in the video almost submerged its head in water
this is the best use of a macro lens that i‚Äôve ever seen
initially i thought you just casually had a lion to take photos of
every time i try this the lighting always fucks with me amp i end up with a more blurry picture than i remember lol
maybe you should do something about that facial hair well i guess it looks ok nevermind sorry
but now i am wondering if cats ever get boogers i dont think i have ever seen a cat with a booger after countless years living with these animals they must have a secret
kinda random but i use a small photo box to take pictures of marijuana for dispensaries and i‚Äôve been wondering what type of macro lens would anyone suggest for my iphone xs max to take the proper professional pictures for menus
i hope you got that little bit of fluff outa his nose it s tickling my nose looking at it tickletickle
i loooove my lil boys sweet fuzzy nose so i deeply appreciate this ‚ù§
you may need to see a doctor your nose should not look like that
took me a minute to realise this was a snoot and not the butt of what appeared to be a marsupial
so before my eyes actually focused i thought i was looking at a sloth
isn t this just that digital painting someone posted the other day just flipped and out of focus
it‚Äôs clearly stressed it probably got its ass beat a few times to learn this wholesome trick although i hope i‚Äôm wrong
the adults like i want it but no my puppy must have it not me
mama papa dog clearly not having a good time have we learned nothing from that smiling after being adopted dog people are idiots
these videos are repulsive stressed out dogs forced to perform anthropomorphic acts for video likes
that dog definitely looks like it gets beat it knew the owner wouldn t be happy that it gave away the treat intended for it
in this thread say something nice downvote have no evidence or reason but say something deplorable happened to make this up it goes i m actually kinda shocked seeing what sub it s in
yeah nothing awww about this unless you mean in an aw that s sad way that dog is clearly stressed scared
that puppy looks catatonic and this entire video is a shitshow
some shady shit going on here downvote this into oblivion
these dogs look traumatized it s the same with of the aww videos recently please don t upvote and encourage whatever is happening to these poor animals
i ll do anything you want just don t beat me and my son again
oh god i had cats and so many annoying deer you re living the dream amp x b better check him for ticks though
that cat will forever be at that post a mobile petting station
damn how salty is that cat but seriously idkw the deer is licking that cat so vigorously
what would be interesting is knowing what transpired to bring this about cats seem to have a supernatural power to make others do their bidding
from the other videos i ve seen of deer she s probably doing a taste test
symbiotic relationship the cat gets tongue scratches the deer gets a mouth full of hairs
i once saw a deer while i was out walking it started following me so i slowed down and it ended up walking about feet behind me it was incredible
my cat once stalked a full size deer flat to the ground stealthy like i thought he was pretty ambitious probably figured if he got one eats for a week the deer just walked over and sniffed him and cat was in pure panic mode
cats are training deer now the revolution is coming
a better title would be ‚Äúlooks like kitty has a deer friend‚Äù
if i saw a deer coughing up a hairball i d assume it was demonically possessed
how the cat leans in for the deer licks like he is hitting the right spot
if that kitty was a kilograms bigger they wouldn t have been friends
welcome back intrepid explorer now don t do that again
scary glad he s home if he s not microchiped i d recommend we have what must have been someone s cat at some point she wasn t chipped but she s friendly amp spayed i haven t ruled out that the previous owners of our house considered her a barn cat and abandoned her
i hope you gave him a good talking to scaring you like that glad he s back
days would have me in a mess im sure they will have cat gps that is as small as a microchip soon so we can always know where the little fluffs are lol
things happened he was having a blast or someone had him
i had a kitten when i lived in hawaii and i came home one day and couldn t find him anywhere i finally heard some meowing coming from wayy high in a tree we had a discussion the cat and i and then i broke down and called an aborist to come get the little dude i thought he learnt his lesson nope days later same scenario same tree same spot same conversation same arborist so now i m deep from having some dude rescue my kitten i figured this time he had learnt his lesson nope days later up the same tree well this time we had a serious conversation i told him look dude i m just going to leave some food here i m here whenever you want to come down i don t see many kitten skeletons in trees so figure it out the next day he doesn t come down the next day he doesn t come down that night a storm kicked up guess who comes rolling in at am soaking wet tired and hungry with branches hanging off everywhere i never called another arborist
mine went missing for a day i ended up finding him in a trap set up for racoons that was baited with cat food glad i went looking for him he occasionally wants to stay out at night but doesn t miss breakfast for anything
he didn‚Äôt come home to find you married to another cat did he
new cat owner i m pretty scared to give him free reign but it seems like they always come back or is that just subjective
my cat would sometimes leave for weeks at a time but he would eventually come back i think he had a second family because he didn t come back hungry
my baby got out for a month i was ready to say she was gome for good but then i hear the loudest yowling and she was a ross the parking lot by the dumpster she was so emaciated üò• make sure you feed him slowly just in case he had a less than ideal food sitch
congrats on having him back our cat was missing for eight weeks straight last year and when we finally found him he was thin but impressingly muscular
glad your buddy came back my ripley has been gone for almost a year now walked out the door last july and i haven t seen her since she was chipped but animal control never found her
i would give his vet a call and see if they would like to do once over just to make sure
my orange cat has been missing for a month thanks for giving me hope
don t do this to me right now my cat went missing a week and a half ago i am moving halfway across the country a few weeks from now
i had a cat that didn‚Äôt return until two weeks later we were happy but it turned out she got bit by a fox and ate something she wasn‚Äôt supposed to and we ended up having to put her down rip daisy
this is why i m sworn on to female outdoor cats they don t go on extended expeditions
my cat went missing for just under a month and we found him about miles from home we think he was baiting and moved away long story short we got him back and he slept on his favorite couch for straight days glad you got your kitty back
glad to hear that he came back safe and sound bless the lil cutie
adventure of his life now he is ready to settle down
so very happy to hear you have him back it breaks my heart whenever i hear about lost pets especially the kitties hope he remains safe with no more excitement ‚ù§Ô∏è
once my cat left for months and came back bigger we don‚Äôt know if someone was feeding him or he was killing animals either way it‚Äôs pretty amazing
my cat got outside once and i was utterly heartbroken because i couldn t find her after a couple of days i printed up big pictures of her and handed them out at every single house in a block radius around my house i rang the bell and handed it to them with pictures and phone number i finally got a call that two sweet little girls had found her in their backyard when your cat gets out don t just put up a sign nobody looks at those print out really big pictures of the cat and distribute them by hand ringing on bells or putting them in mail slots if necessary she was similarly beat she ate two full cans of food and passed out for hours straight
why do cats do this everyone i know who has had cats has a story about them running off for days do they actually get lost or hung up somewhere
in a few months a lot of debt collectors are gonna be knocking on your door looking for mr whisker‚Äôs unpaid child support
welcome home my orange guy came home after months of searching in we last saw him around july th and on halloween night he gave me the most epic meow i have ever heard he passed away this january from cancer just shy of rip mr josey wales my outlaw
so glad the little guy is home‚ù§Ô∏è he does look whooped
the stress must have turned one of his whiskers back
seems a little harsh of a punishment just because he got lost s glad he found his way back i was a wreck when my dude got lost
he was probably tied up in some years old girl s bedroom
i‚Äôm so glad you got him back give that found kitty second chance snuggles
he s been to other worlds and dimensions he will need a couple weeks
so happy became home made me go curl up with my kitty and love on her
my indoor cat bolted out the door and has been missing a couple months so my mom got another one but i miss her weve had her for a few years she usually comes back the next day if she manages to leave the house i see lots of stories of cats coming bsck so im still hopeful fingers crossed
lucky you my cat went missing for one day and she came with a bloody eye and leg
when my kitty was she went missing for a week and our neighbour rudely told us that old cats go away to die my mum lives down the road so she came back home any time she could and then was about to go back to work when she heard meowing she had been in the drains she lasted another few years after that i could not imagine how hard day would have been on you
mine did the same thing twice about years apart i always wondered where he went
painting the town in springtime take time and effort
awww look at his curled tongue big hugs he had some adventures
his little chin and tongue though wish i could let him
my cat has been missing since may rd of this year i miss her so much i am so glad you have your little buddy back home
i‚Äôm so happy he returned i‚Äôd be a nervous wreck waiting on my furboo to come home
i hate to be that guy but take him to the vet if he was unable to eat and lost too much weight there is a risk of fatty liver disease i had an indoor cat go missing for almost a month then the poor guy fell ill in a few days and we lost him
i used to have a cat that would disappear for days at a time got used to it but when she came home she would chug food and water then sleep for like hours strait
lol i wonder what adventures he must have experienced
sleepy from all the fancy feast at his other family s house
aw glad he s back please make sure to take him to the vet to make sure he s alright
woah cat gets home from a long trip and gets beat poor cat
so glad he came home i always worried when they were away more than a day or two when i had outside cats that is now we harness walk them
wouldn t it be great if he could tell you all about the day adventure over beer s an catnip lol
my cat once went missing for about months came back one day like nothing happened
my male cat was missing for days last year and i was an absolute wreck the whole time i don t know what i d have done if i hadn t found him when i did
my heart was the global temperature and this cat was the industrial revolution
beat by who let‚Äôs go kick their ass oh sorry i misread that
both of my dogs went missing for mo this and then we found d them and we still have them after the past years
so many reddit veterinarians wow impressive your kitty will be fine your love shows
i had a foster get out once semi feral and figured he was gone i posted on all the forums and was getting spottings but not him after over a month i get a call from a neighborhood under construction miles away and head out sure enough the little bastard was there nights of cat traps and i finally got him adopted him the next day he was missing for weeks
good time to secure your premises to stop your cat from wandering and causing harm to native wildlife
one of my cats got out for hours and it was the worst hours of my life i cannot even fathom days so happy he‚Äôs safely back home
my cat is getting older and we have to stop letting him outside we have a lot of strays in the area and although he is a boss he gets beat up here and there and we cant risk him getting hurt again
how could you beat him op he spent so much time trying to get home and this is how you repay him
pretty messed up thing to do to your cat after days apart i bet he really learned his lesson
so glad you got your little guy back i just went through the same thing it‚Äôs a horrible feeling my little dude was missing for days and i just got him back a week ago a lady saw my posts online and called around midnight saying my cat was at her back door what an absolute angel
he still looks so soft though what does he do with his fur
you re making me very sad i had disappear months ago they were under a year but i miss them still
my kitty chester indoor kitty that sometimes ventures out but only chaperoned disappeared about six years ago with no trace for weeks every day after work i would wander the neighborhood with fliers there i was seven months pregnant sobbing and screaming ‚Äúchester‚Äù and ‚Äúcheese‚Äù every day i would hurry home sure he‚Äôd be waiting outside for me but he never was so i would dissolve into tears it was draining being so hormonal and depressed at the day mark i told myself he was gone and since he was such a friendly cat someone must have taken him him and he was happy that day i headed to work but in the early afternoon i got a text from husband his friend who happened to be dating a girl a few houses down texted a pic of a very thin chester on his car my boss told me to go get my baby so i drove home i work one mile away and retrieved him same chester happy and friendly‚Äîjust much lighter he was all fur and bones turns out the gf heard mewing from the sewer drain they‚Äôre huge in ga and she reached in and pulled him out i suspect he may have been frightened or was thirsty and headed down there but got stuck when he was three months old he had a raging ear infection that compromised his inner ear stray momma so he has difficulties with balance when jumping up down i‚Äôm so glad you found your kitty too
my little buddy went missing for a couple of weeks once it‚Äôs a tough thing to go through i put up a few posters and i actually received a call they said they think they saw him a nearby i wandered the area over the next few days but there was no sign of him one morning i woke up and heard a familiar meow outside my apartment i looked out the balcony and there‚Äôs my buddy in the neighbour‚Äôs yard with skunks i didn‚Äôt ask any questions went down to get him and he ran over to me i brought him home and he devoured a feast and slept like a baby
wait are you in santa ana cuz i saw a flyer that looks like him
congratulations my cat went missing for days once and i know the panic and horror that causes so glad they eventually find their way home
my cat simba who was an indoor outdoor cat he made a hole in the living room window screen for exits and entrances disappeared once he was gone for a week or so and just when i had given up hope showed up in the living room he was a little worse for wear with a small hole in his ear but was the same old lovable ornery fellow
he s probably going to babymamas chasing him down in a few months asking for kitten support
tha fuck are they thinking guess they need the adventure
that cat probably killed like birds you should be more careful
my year old boy took off days ago i don t have high hopes for a happy ending i m devastated my house is so empty i m glad to hear the happy endings for others though
don t open exterior doors without your cats behind another one
glad he s home we lost our cat for several months before she was found miles away emaciated and in poor shape poor baby but bless those souls who took her into the vet and had the chip scanned she s fat and sassy again glad your kitty is home poor boy
look at his tongue he was to tired to put it back in
i‚Äôm not really a cat person so what happens the cats just dart out unexpectedly when you open a door do they claw out a screen or are these outdoor cats that just go out and get lost
awesome we had our lily missing for months came home one day injured and weight loss took her to the vet somehow her collar got caught under her leg and was digging into her made a bad open and infected wound now shes healed and back to purr fect thank for and awesome vet
is it really or possibly be close to a nightmare lol beautiful dog
instead of haunting your dreams he just sorta licks you when you re sleeping the claws are just to defend any intruders he s still a good boy
the only thing i can focus on is this creepy murder tool he has on his paw
petme kruger freddy woofer steals all treats from your dreams
i d risk getting murdered in my sleep to see this pupper
i‚Äôd let that adorable guy haunt my nightmares any night
camera points to the grass slow pan up claw enters frame followed by the rest of the body face enters frame record scratch hi this is me now your probably
i had a pet goat he was so fun followed me around like a puppy cuddled played wonderful pet
r i p the tie on the other side of the hallway he was probably chasing üòÇ
i made a painting of this but currently having upload issues with imgur will attempt again soon
people ask me why i do it this this is why and groupies lots of groupies more than rock stars even yup
i have a pet goat she stays out side most of the time but she loves to jump on the trampoline with me
this is the type of wholesome shit that gets me thru the day
the remake of silence of the lambs seems to be quite wholesome
i ve made a terrible career choice i coulda had a job where i could dance with the goats sigh
can t believe it bounced back after that wolverine attack
is this video about how cute the goat is or how cute the vet is
i didn t even feel like jumping but you looked so foolish doing it alone
shit i just ate lamb now i feel like a really bad person
they are trying to get the goat to hurt itself to they can fix it again wake up america
probably my th time seeing this video on this subreddit but it never gets old
i want a veterinary clinic like that for my good bois
i do that with my goats only the young ones can get any air lol
that explains a lot about animations in goat simulator
‚Äúlet me dance the dance of your people then followed by a song‚Äù
forget my life trajectory i need to work at a vet s office
is this the same vet that was posted here a couple of days ago that was caught dancing while holding hugging kissing a little dog either way this is awesome
nice all the other reposts i ve seen of this have had horrible slo mo and i couldn t bear to watch them
when everything is going to shit in this country thankfully we still have these moments
not sure which we re supposed to aww at imma do both
til redditors dont know goats and sheep are different animals
it s cute but i also saw a goat eat a chick few hours ago so now i m conflicted about goats
next thing we know it‚Äôs gonna start saying moo and flying
wonder how many missed the pun in the headline baby goat is called a kid
this makes me want to be a vet but then i realize that everyday isn t like this
thank you for the regular speed version i always saw it in slowmo and it s just not the same
thank you for posting this without the pointless slow motion
do people really not know the difference between a goat and a lamb
hahahahahaha get it bc a kidd is a baby goat hahahahaha
omg that s an animal control amd adoption center near where i live
a goat seems like a terribly awesome pet i‚Äôve got the space an yard for it how‚Äôs the daily care
what an adorable young lady nothing wrong with a little crazy made me smile
looks like the vet is pretty good looking next to having a awesome career if i were the goat i d be dancin and prancin too
goat i love goats so much probably my favorite farm animal they re hilarious they like standing on things even other animals they like to imitate you they copy what they see thats probably why the goat was hoping around because it was copying the lady each species has its own unique sound
this is like one of those stereotypical turkish slippers with the furry ball on the end except so much better and cuter
omg you have been blessed the highest among cat honors now however you‚Äôre freedom to move has been lifted you shall now only abide to the kitten
can we appreciate that he got both the nike logo and the adidas logo in the picture
my brain just scrambled a few times trying to touch it and not being able to
the kitty is comfortable and can sit like that for hours however the human not so much after a while the human will beg the kitty to move
was looking at it for a full minute waiting for the cat to move
this is disgraceful who wears adidas socks with nike pants
a predator but not an apex predator a location where they can rest and survey their environment while feeling safe from danger check
my wife and i do this at night when the cat jumps on the bed we take any sort of affection he s willing to give out so we put up with him laying in the worst damn spot possible sleep like shit unable to move your legs but the bragging rights for who he chose to snuggle on are totally worth it maybe prob not not at all
i would get such a foot cramp from not daring to move
i had kittens that would do this all the time one for each foot i was like well i guess i don t have anywhere to go now
how does it stick to the foot i know they have claws but thats a kitten i doubpt it has big enough to hold on to a sock
tis the season of all the kitten pictures and i m loving it
this kitten invented a whole new kind of toe bean to be obsessed with
this is reaching seemingly impossible levels of cute
i love how cats can find almost any position comfortable
a couple of those claws in your toe and it‚Äôs going to be real difficult to keep your foot still
i am drunk but what is left functining of my brain insists that this is this is the cutest thing i ever saw
i love how cats fall asleep in the most random places
yeah your not moving anywhere for the foreseeable future
this is not an original photo op has copied off someone else saw the same photo post a few days ago
the fluffer has conquered the your foot there is no escape
i showed this to my girlfriend and she just broke down in awww
for a second thought this was some type of faux fur slippers but definitely real fur
oh my god what a cutie look at his her round little back and she he fits only on one foot its so incredibly adorable
i can die now as this is the cutest thing i think i‚Äôll ever see üòª
i know this is horrible but did anyone else imagine flinging the cat off the foot with a wild kick
cat law states that anyone else in the house has to provide your food and drinks until kitty decides to move
some say that foot is in the same position to this day
excuse me you have a tiny loaf of kitten on your foot so adorable
i m gonna pretend that s a normal sized cat and you have a giant foot
i‚Äôll pay to the guy who says op‚Äòs name three times as fast as possible without stuttering
not to be weird but i would die for your baby toe bean kitty
i see u got the equivalent oph champion vapors nai sit on top oph the world tooü•≥ü•≥üéäüéâ
i thought i was the only person to wear adidas and nike at the same time
i‚Äôm hoping that foot does not offend for kittie‚Äôs sake
i hope you have some water near by i sense a serious foot cramp on the way
the minute this poor kitty settles in is the moment my foot gets insanely itchy
pack it up this is peak cuteness this sub can t get any better
talk about nike adidas ignorance my god man what is wrong with you
just to be safe and just having a single feet warm you need two of these
there‚Äôs a kitty on your foot and i wannnnnna touch it
this ‚Äúwearing nike and adidas at the same time‚Äù thing is getting out of hand
clingy i hope your foot grows as big as the baby enjoy
well that s it now u cut ur feet to never move it ever
how u do my cat won‚Äôt do this too big haha ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
y‚Äôall care about the cat but i‚Äôm just wondering what‚Äôs playing on the tv it looks like an anime but i can‚Äôt be sure
i can‚Äôt keep my feet still long enough for any cat to even get a whiff of an idea that it‚Äôs a great place to sleep but it‚Äôs adorable nonetheless
that kitten looks so proud of itself like ‚Äúi found this perch all on my own and it‚Äôs warm and i love it ‚Äù and i want to cuddle this kitty so much
once you get comfy like that you will suddenly have the need to pee
please post a new one after kitten is full grown i want to see it trying to still sit on your foot
thought i was the only one who sacrificed my comfort for my furs
this is right up there with the dog that curled up on the goose grade a post op
super cute kitty cuddles thanks for the warm fuzzy feelings
before you know it he ll be another pixel stealing docks right off your feet
i bet that kitten is now going to do that everyday for the rest of it s life
you stole this from a tiktok unless you uploaded that
i thought this was a gif or video and waited min to let it play cause i thought it was my internet
i‚Äôm not a cat person but this makes me warm and fuzzy inside
i don‚Äôt like this what if the kitty loses its balance and falls
smellykitten smelly kitten what are they feeting you no offense to the op or creators socks implied
you re going to need your better half to bring you ibuprofen and water for the cramping
don t you date fucking move hell attack at any moment
awwww my cat sometimes comes in my room at night and puts its head against mine my cat is weird
me my husband and my two teenage boys legit ‚Äùsqueed‚Äù when we small this smol beauty üòª
thus the reason an obviously very young kitten looks big is that the kitten was pasted on the photo no wonder it looked beautiful but odd thank you for alerting me to my somnolent common sense
oh my gosh it s so tiny the first thought that came to my head was bean and it s cool other people thought the same thing when they looked at it
white adidas sport socks where is this eastern europe
nobody cares about the fact that she‚Äôs wearing both adidas and nike at the same time
this has given me diabetes i‚Äôm going to lose my feet
hey i saw this on instagram he wiggles around a bit on the foot and settles in it s so cute
are people really scrolling past without giving a high
rose looks so much like a dog i had as a kid high five
i can feel this photo knocking my phone out of my hand
pleased to meet you rose wish i was there to give you a high five in person
she reminds me of my onyx he passed away in october and i miss his face
she looks exactly like my dog kava what breed is she if you know my kava is a german shepherd wire haired pointing griffon
without thinking i high fives her paw or is it high foured
haha toe beans kitty toe beans are often posted but not so much the doggos
aww i‚Äôve got a kitty named rosie can she be friends with rose
coincidentally it s now the best picture this sub has ever gotten of your dog rose too
everything about this is purrfect how the focus catches her eyes how the tag covers your personal info her tilted head and let‚Äôs not forget that paw photo
my first dog was a boxer named rosie half the pictures i took was her looking at me with a disproving look
i too have a black lab mix with brown eyes and a white spot on her chest named rose who refuses to let a decent picture to be taken of her
i m days into a no added sugar diet and that exactly how i feel today
i can only hope to have a fraction of this kind of comfort
really he may be part sailor we can sleep anywhere on anything at a moment s notice
are your sure it hasn t miscalculated a jumo hit its head and passed out do check
title should be he can sleep anywhere that should be the most uncomfortable place to nap
that s one smart dog he knew damn well not to look directly at the cake and give away his intentions
the more i watch it the funnier it gets i legit almost spit out my water
i feel as if they were not as prepared as they should of been having chocolate within that perimeter of a dog
that dog has zero discipline lol that girl needs to teach it some manners
wait for what this to be reposted again in another week
i hope hes ok as that seems like red velvet cake which i m sure is just red chocolate cake
damn thats disrespectful as fuck i wouldn t let my dog do that
your people have eaten my kind for centuries now i will have my revenge
dogs are fucking sneaky people think cats are anytime i had a dog growing up the damn thing was always trying to find its way to eat whatever you re getting ready to eat or whatever it was on the table or on the counter
he s known round these parts as gold velvet the smoothest of all criminals
that was disappointing i was hoping for the shirt to come off
now she can t take a picture of it and post it on instagram good boi
this is exactly what my dog would do haha reminds me so much of my black lab
red velvet cake is just chocolate cake with red dye
ahh yes the age ol good boi trick distract with kisses and go for the prize while the human is distracted
i wait for the dog chew the clothes off disappointed
that rascal had the perfect plan i think he might have done that before
doggy version of the flip and wave the lick and cake
he protecc he attacc but most importantly he steals snacc
oof hope that brown cake muffin didn t have any chocolate in it
still pretty staged right before he jumps on her you can see her tap for him to do it
i don t know what to do about my roommates dog you can t turn your back on food for a second because of this exact shit and she constantly starts fights with my smaller dog everyday by relentlessly biting his leg she s basicially a big bully and here i thought black labs were supposed to be easygoing
the look in his eyes as he dives for the food is priceless
yikess would not be a fan of someones big dog jumping on me like that without an invite all up in my business and then stole food bad owner
i‚Äôll be damned if my dog steals food right in front of me no good manners here
that s great i m glad he didn t get the crap flogged out of him
cool that they stop hissing as soon as they see he s helping the chicks
i would never even think about touching a goose‚Äôs babies near them
that goose seemed pretty happy the way it was bobbing its head up and down
straight up thought this was a high res rpg at first
thank you human i ll refrain from biting you on the butt this time
as a canadian i will say this this guy is the bravest man on the face of the earth he s lucky he walked away with his face still intact
very brave geese do not mess around with their goslings around
see the way mom and pop s mouths are open tongues slightly out that s them telling him to get the fuck away from their children
geese are mean fuckers once found a mom goose laying on eggs and i would bring it bread everyday and all it would do before and after i fed her she would just hiss at me on an other occasion i saw a male raping another goose i assume it was a female it was a pretty awful
i nearly died when the two little guys fell in between the cracks i thought they were goners and yes that amazing human is lucky to have his body parts in tact i tried to take pics of a momma daddy and their babies and i definitely got hissed at
living in canada has taught me one thing never mess with these honking assholes he probably got attacked right after he stopped filming
good guy my heart sunk when i saw them drop in the track
yeah i tried doing this one time ended up with a full sized goose launching itself at my head and road rash up and down the entire left side of my body
i want to be in a street fight with a geese at least once only to see how it is
braver than me canadian geese ain t nothin to fuck with wouldn t even trust the little ones tbh
mans lucky to be alive those fuckers are viscous but if you gots a problem with canadian geese then you gots a problem with me
canada gooses are majestic barrel chested the envies of all ornithologies
is it just me or do i hear turkey noises at the end from the geese
ok so that means they won‚Äôt shit on his car today but tomorrow all bets are off
i‚Äôm surprised those geese didn‚Äôt kick his ass if i‚Äôm in a mile radius around those fuckers they pounce
you risked your life to save my children hsssssssss hssssssss
now someone please edit ryan gosling s face onto them
human here are your babies i saved them for you geese hiss hisssss hisssss
if you keep facing them they likely won t have the balls to attack you
i wonder how many goslings actually reach adulthood these geese has a lot of goslings and i‚Äôve seen some geese around my area with a good number too but the number of geese i usually see don‚Äôt match the number of goslings i see
sounds like me taking care of the bunnies at our shelter first thing in the morning stop biting me i just wanna clean your shit out and help you guys and give you treats apparently bunnies and goslings are the same inherently prey mentality i swear i m not here to murder and cook you trying to help you guys out stop scratching me you little asshole and let me love and take care of you
if you ever see animals in need put down the fucking camera and help them
saves the geese and gets hit by a train also their not ducks lol
love how the geese are still doing the fuck off strut
it‚Äôs totally the urbanized geese too rural geese are hard to get even meters close to one city geese will literally cut my car off and then act like i‚Äôm the asshole
very cool i like it i‚Äôd have said ‚Äúhelps‚Äù and not ‚Äúsaves‚Äù though
this could have gone bad in a way that isn‚Äôt obvious messing with the scents on chicks like that can be destructive i‚Äôve seen ducks drown their own children traumatic experience
my ignorant understanding is that some animals will abandon their young if touched by a human
eh chill goose chill üò† keep it up with the neck and so help me i‚Äôll put those damn things back where they were üò§
thank you you can go now you can go now you can go now
my heart skipped a beat when they fell between planks that gave me a scare
level pest government has removed all restrictions ok killing them due to the harm they cause yet here we are regularly creating near miss high speed traffic pile ups in order to save each and every one of those adorable little shit machines
i‚Äôm sorry but when birds detect strand scent on their offspring they will snap its neck
you ve bought yourself ten seconds human use them well
‚Äúthanks dude but i‚Äôm still gonna wreck your shit back up‚Äù that goose is evil
every time i hit a car at a crossing or put my train into emergency for someone walking down along the tracks they‚Äôre always shocked utterly appalled that there could possibly be a train on those tracks we can come out of nowhere and trains don‚Äôt necessarily make much noise or rumble the ground if it‚Äôs coasting it‚Äôs eerily quiet you should expect a train at all times coming from both directions it‚Äôs not some great mystery we only have two directional options on a stretch of track for anyone who might suggest otherwise those tracks are in current use the tops of the rail are clean and the ties are too good to be abandoned i know you think it won‚Äôt happen to you but you‚Äôre the one it happens to please don‚Äôt risk trainmen‚Äôs safety and conscience with your complacency and if you must do this stuff at least pay attention instead of filming with one hand this guy would not have noticed a train until it was too late had there been one
honestly geese are the biggest arseholes probably in the universe i feed some and take care of them on a daily basis they have a goosling with them i feed and take care of him too yet every day without fair they hiss like crazy at me while also feign charge at me my dog who looks on uninterested all this then they go attack the other ducklings i m looking after for literally no reason such arseholes
i can just imagine the one thats honking a lot after he saves them is just lecturing its children
and then gets harassed by the parents no good deed goes unpunished
i cannot believe you escaped that misadventure without having a goose attack you
wow first time i saw one of these in the wild before it got posted on reddit
the guy sounds exactly like jacob collins from trailer park boys
i wonder how the mother count their children strength we have number system so we calculate but goose
i like to think they are yelling at their kids at the end haha
i audibly gasped when the chicks fell through the rails i thought they were just gone
all jokes aside how powerfully a goose v i feel it should be easy enough to just grab it by the neck and fuck it up
the elder geese seem to be having an internal crisis of whether or not to be thankful or ripping this guy s ass inside out
love you for helping the the baby ü¶Ü a good turn will follow you
here is what the adult geeze were thinking ‚Äúget the fucking goslings over here asshole‚Äù here you go i saved you ‚Äúhow fucking dare you touch our children you piece of shit ‚Äù
canada geese the most impolite canadian folks ever probably because they spend much of their lives south of the border canadians are great their namesake geese are kind of rude and agressive
i do the same neck motion when someone returns my child to me
kinda similar thing happened to my mom‚Äôs friend in new jersey goslings couldn‚Äôt hop onto the curb and were stuck on the road he led them around the curb through a nearby parking lot to their parents the parents hissed at him but didn‚Äôt attack
i did this exact same thing with canada geese last week in jersey city my husband was not happy i intervened i‚Äôm pretty sure he thought i was going to get beat up by mama bird have to say the gosling was so fluffy and adorable
he‚Äôs lucky those cobra chickens didn‚Äôt murder him real good
those are the tamest canada geese i‚Äôve ever seen my dad and i were hiking up to an abandoned radar base with our dog once and we came around a switchback and stopped dead in our tracks when we saw two geese and a dozen goslings in the middle of the road then the dog saw them and barked leading then to honk like crazy as the flew in circles over us and kept diving down at us we sprinted through the next two switchbacks to get away
when this man is in his darkest hour and in dire need of help he will hear a honking from the sky as canada gooses come to repay their debt
an oncoming train would ve made for an even more aww some video
he‚Äôs obviously never seen geese attack braver than me they‚Äôre usually pretty mean when you‚Äôre that close
how is this man not dead from a goose bill to the jugular
i don t know why but i was expecting little ryan goslings
how did he not get destroyed by that papa goose i had a family in my front yard right on the water and my dumb ass walked out there to feed them some cheerios and got bull rushed by the dad hissing like a demon they came all the way up to about ten feet from the door where i dropped the cereal and fled though
i‚Äôve never encountered a goose before but all these posts about how scary and violent they are makes me want to try to fight one haha
aww that s a sweet kind of act added to that the parents of the two stranded goslings didn t leave them until they get saved
i was a letter carrier this one walk i did for a few months was near the river there were always several pair of canada geese on the river bank where i couldn t avoid them because it was exactly where i had to deliver to houses right on the river they kept me on my toes but the scariest ones lived nearby on top of a four story apartment building they could descend on you from above when you weren t expecting it i had never seen geese roosting on buildings before
that ending sound why does it have to be so damn loud and out of nowhere who even thought putting that at the end was a good idea
what an ungrateful goose he needs to go to the store to buy a new attitude
honestly how much damage could a goose do to a human i‚Äôd fuck two of those things up at the same time no problem
those poor animals at the mercy of humans and all our contraptions i was so scared thank kismet this rescuer was around
what if the parents were trying to teach them life lessons about facing adversity and this guy just came along and messed up that whole lesson
omg my heart dropped when they went under the tracks
these videos always make my heart warm but like if i saw this i couldn‚Äôt imagine thinking ‚Äúi should also film this‚Äù especially near geese and especially near train tracks
i probably would have done the same thing even though the last thing the world needs is more canada geese
i really hope that one day those geese are able to return the favour and rescue op from some sort of train track related emergency
man moves geese across the train tracks and begins filming his heroic rescue
i d love that animals would be able to say thank you when things like this happen
ya know they would be cute if they didn t sound like they got throat punched while inhaling a cigarette
nah biology fuck your animal protectivnes im gonna dump them and no goose shall attack me
the first few seconds look like it s in a video game
i did this with ducklings once mama went over a median on a semi empty street and left probably six babies behind ducklings can go really freaking fast when they want to run away but another bystander stopped to help me and we got them all safely across
did anyone read the description like ryan gosling gosling or is it a typo
i got by one in the ass at the phoenix zoo as a kid eff them lol
goslings and ducklings are so cute i love their little wings
quick someone photoshop ryan gosling‚Äôs face on them
ah a gosling is a young goose non native english speaker here so a darling is a young dar
i never thought that canadian geese are actually hateful creatures where i‚Äôm from we don‚Äôt have those kind of geese and when i was years old we moved with my family to united states my first encounter with canadian geese was on a lake and i thought to myself wow what an amazing beautiful geese because in my motherland we usually have only small farm geese but as a kid to me those were looking tall and gorgeous and i thought to myself that they look kind a like swans so long story short me and my mom went to a grocery store to pick up a few bread rolls for them so we went back to the lake to feed them and i never seen even a one goose hiss at me so we fed them for a couple of more days like days and when i came on the like on fifth day thats what got me amazed so hear me out ok you guys telling me this creatures are full of hatred and will attack you right or is it some sord of meme haha but what i saw on my fifth day of feeding those critters got me surprised if so as usual i was feeding them a nice loaf of bread and i saw mama geese and like to small yellow baby geese running around and i was sitting in front of the lake on a grass and they were like on the right side from me looking at me and the babies came by themselves and start to eat and jump on me and play with me and then big mama came in and i pet her too and fed her so no attacking no hissing she was like a few inches away from my face haha so what got me questioned is from the knowledge of the reddit posts about geese i have this that those critters are not mess around with and even if you do good to them they will still try to mess with you but as a small kid that didn‚Äôt know that those geese were aggressive i never felt a fear or even a slight idea that they can do me wrong i thought they are a usual wild lake birds that won‚Äôt trust a human being but they came around even to trust with their small babies so i think its like this if you fear an animal or have a second thought about them being good and even if you have this slightest idea i think animals can feel it and act according its like dogs that smell fear and can attack you because they can smell adrenaline pumping into your blood so can someone actually explain me is it a meme or is it actually true that canadian geese are mad in the head
man helps get the geese their children back geese still fuck you
the adult birds were like youre a badguy but this does not mean your a bad guy
whoever took this video has some goddamn titanium balls being willing to get that close to a canadian goose those things are birds that never forgot they used to be dinosaurs
has anyone ever actually been attacked by a goose all these comments saying how scary and nasty geese are but not one saying they ve ever actually been harmed it s like some big myth put out by the geeserati to make them sound tougher than they are what are they actually going do peck or flap their wings at you
option grab both babies with both hands while you have the chance option keep filming with one hand and make two trips the second baby is getting deeper into the crack which one will give me more internet points
you know mom and dad were grateful cause they didn t attack
i did that too they were screaming for mommy to wait for them they were so soft and fuzzy then i stopped traffic so they all could cross the street safely my good deed for the day yay
no i was referring to my sibling being a few feet tall‚Ä¶ if that
i think the neck bend they do might be their version of thanks
please don t trespass onto the railway even to save goslings
and he got them vertically that‚Äôs a rare achievement
wow that took me a long time to figure out i thought his mouth was closed and the ball was stuck in his neck
i thought the top ball was his chin and i was very confused
personally you re brave to allow your dog especially golden to play with balls they could swallow imho i don t let my golden s play with tennis balls etc just in case then again mine are a bit braindead
if i stare him in the eyes i see no balls just a cute golden with a mean poker face this guys going places balls and all
i stared at this for like seconds before i realized the upper ball wasn‚Äôt his chin
my dog does this differently she sort of deep throats the first ball and holds the second ball in front in the normal ball holding place this way she doesn t have to put down ball to pick up ball
you think that s impressive ive been carrying three balls since birth s
i completely thought the dog had two mouths and i was concerned
technically balls if the dog is male and hasn t been neutered yet
my golden does this too he‚Äôs learning to get three he‚Äôs also a future service dog
how did you get him to sit still long enough to cram the nd ball in that important to get a photo posted nice
i ve done that all my life but no one commended me for that
just be careful i had a dog that almost died from trying the same with two tennis balls he got one of them stuck in his throat and we had to get him to the hospital to get it out luckily he was ok after they got it out
i played with one that did this but then he would get a third one and almost swallow the first
my god that s adorable we need more oddball animals here
look like candy to eat hahahahha i want candy to eat because i vege guy
so did the photographer kill it since it s too cute for this world
fortunately for it amphibians are going extinct at a breakneck pace
this is the cutest frog i have absolutely ever seen in my whole life
frogs are wholesome until an amphibious one starts living in your pool and croaking like its a blonde in a horror movie every night gt soruce this happened
i want to believe this thing has a diet like nibbler on futurama
i m sorry but that is not a frog but in fact it is a leafy doggo
might be completely toxic though the cute usually are
is it just me or does that thing look like it staired into the void and cannot comprehend what it has seen
too bad most of our frogs are rapidly losing population
this green slime like thing with dots as eyes im living
from the thumbnail i was honestly expecting a pop vinyl
you can tell it s a kid because it is wearing a striped shirt
i would sacrifice myself for the sake of this child
her name is violet she lives at catskill animal sanctuary and she s so cute
the cat must have thought they needed incubating like eggs
i see one big orange seed that has sprouted handsomely
yes they did they sprouted you a lovely orange kitty
s he is warm and round and orange like the sun what more do you need
your cat maybe need more contact to nature my two are the same i made them an raised bad on the balcony with bamboo and meadow they absolute love it if the weather is k at least one of them is laying in the bed
they multiplied who invented this it s the greatest invention since sliced bread
disney was wrong this is the happiest place on earth
the parks and recreation theme song immediately began playing in my head
ain‚Äôt no party like a liz lemon party cause a liz lemon party is mandatory
ain‚Äôt no party like a captain holy party cause a captain holt party is a total surprise to everyoneüò¨
if only i had this many people even creatures smile at me at the same time i would be happy

yikes he s in trouble women get real catty when they re jealous
‚Äúi like u so much more than muffins ‚Äù cat runs away frantically ‚Äúhey why u leave ‚Äù feline realization‚Äîfuck she‚Äôs behind me ‚Äúit‚Äôs not what you think honey ‚Äù ‚Äúi‚Äôm taking each one of your nine lives you son of a female cat‚Äù ridiculously loud and vicious cat fight ensues edit mobile user problems
for any south park fans this is what i immediately thought of amp x b aw hell dad i got lots of girlfriends sally is just my bottom b tch
it s a like a really bad or is it a really good daytime soap
can someone edit this video to remove the shitty ass music
some of the worst audio in reddit history fuck that poison
that brief moment where black kitty is totally confused what did i do was it something i said
same scenario reenacted nightly in clubs across the world
could see those white whiskers on that black cat a mile away
thank you for blurring out the fire hydrants face their identity is safe
that obnoxious track and the video with these bitchy comments i lol ed
the music is absolute trash holy fucking god anything in the history of mankind would ve been better than that shit brb going to go listen to some justin beiber or baby shark just to listen to anything but that music
terrible soundtrack terrible caption much better caption he s behind me isn t he
everyone s a gangsta until the real gangster walks in
i saw this on instant regret but i don t know which one is the repost
what a cute baby our weiner dog likes to sleep like that too
this little cutie i kinda feel like caramel ice cream now though
that s a cocktail weenie they re so adorable at this age just to look at them you fall in love over and over
a very beautiful doggy and her mind is in a deep dream
can i have your dog please jaw droppingly cute what breed
a small english cream longhair we have one too a mini female absolutely adorable dogs with soft hair
reminds me of my dog she curls up a little more and we call her a cinnamon doughnut
a very good doggo made me smile to see them sleeping very cute
the golden weenie the traits of a golden retriever and compact size of the foul weenie hund look at the chi weenie chihuahua weenie dog foul beasts
meanwhile i still struggle with stick figures smfh this is absolutely amazing
does anyone know who makes it like an instagram or something
it‚Äôs neat but kinda creepy that it‚Äôs mounted like that
i‚Äôd pay for that almost got teary just watching when one of the cats looked like mine üò≥
wow this is so much better than paying hundreds for a cuddle clone does anyone know the artist‚Äôs info
after they re mounted it s like a more fucked up version of the last episode of chernobyl
i wonder if she makes ferrets as well i would love to get one made
this is what happens when dogs give up on having any kind of outdoor life
i love that oogie is all yeah just chillin too that thing on the back of the couch oogie boogie man from the film the nightmare before christmas too much i m old so
not gonna lie i thought the dog was a kangaroo for a sec
the dog looks like a kangaroo or the kangaroo looks like a dog
but do you really need to be told to not let your child and pet die
having a raccoon lick your eyeball is exactly how aids happens
careful he s gonna smuggle it out from contraxia in his
raccoons really got fingers up in this bitch that‚Äôs trippy
hes just trying to get a eyeball cuz he knows he will need to give it thor in the future duh
that‚Äôs terribly distracting is this gonna be ongoing
pretty sure only that adorable smol boi would be able to hear the sound i just made
man this reminds me of my dog so much the same eyes everything made me wonder what he looked like when he was a puppy couldn t be much bigger than that then made me sad because he deserved the world just like this puppy does but he didn t get it i hope i can at least give him some happiness even if it s years too late
i would be all ‚Äúyes yes but did yr day involve snuggling a smol pupper if not you should get started ‚Äù üòÑ‚ù§Ô∏è
why are you dating a puppy and what‚Äôs so interesting about a gatorade bottle are you wondering what flavor it is it‚Äôs clearly black jellybean i‚Äôm not sure what flavor the gatorade is though but the bottle definitely tastes like plastic
jesus how do people trust their cats like this mine would take both of my eyes out and the ovary of my next door neighbor if i managed to get this close
my cat also loves to me as close as he can to my face never bit or scratched me since i adopted him years ago
this is true love energy radiating from both of you
dam woman you re sexy if i were that cat i would do the same thing just saying
awww my kitty also cuddles with me every night if i m not awake to move the blanket so she can be my little spoon she lays on my pillow head
it always weirds me out to see a cat put its face on a person s face i ve owned cats my entire life and all of them were friendly and affectionate but none of them liked having their face anywhere near another face
let‚Äôs repost this a few more time in a few days shall we
i miss my big fuzz boy he lets me rub my face in his belly if he s in a good mood purring in any case he s down for pets of the time he s only told me no once but i try to be good about giving him enough space in the first place he s probably the only cat in existence that will ever let me get so close but here s to crossing fingers and hoping for the best cat love is a little different than dog love i think cats need to choose you too or at least cats are typically harder to impress
my cat like many would sleep on my face if he could this is not allowed i set boundries and he knows he gets kicked off the bed if he doesnt respect them
i love when my cat does this but i can only stand it for about minutes he drools an unreasonable amount and it smells like rancid fish but worst of all his whiskers itch so bad
aw yes the good ol‚Äô litterbox urine and shit paw to the face love cats but no way are those filthy paws coming anywhere around my face just the same as my dog isn‚Äôt licking my face with her chicken shit butt licking tongue of hers
my cats are both former strays and they re also the first cats i ve had that have been cuddlers my female cat will sit with me for hours at a time if i don t move p
through reddit i‚Äôve realized that cats and dogs actually smile when they‚Äôre happy
that is not love that is the cat stretching because the dumb human wanted to make a video and woke the cat source have cats and i can relate to them
and then they stretch on you with their sharp ass claws declawing is inhumane imo and if you give them too much love they decide enough¬° and they claw the shit out of you cats are bipolar
immediately followed by the cat suddenly randomly going crazy and scratching her face to shit
a cat shows its trust in someone by closing its eyes around them if a cat sleeps on your chest it trusts you
is it just me or are there a lot of adorable cats that look like this my cat looks exactly like this and is named goose
and you ve never heard of the diseases cats can transfer
will smith definitely is one of the most amazing people on earth
if will smith didn‚Äôt have weird kids i‚Äôd think he was perfect
will smith definitely does take after his predecessor robin williams both are kind souls
will smith is awesome he always goes above and beyond for kids thank you ws
if anyone wants to know why i was downvoted to high hell please dm me they are trying to silence the truth thanks and have a wonderful day may god bless you amen
too cute no big deal just gonna slip under the rope on the red carpet
these little girls are super famous by the way look em up on kcstauffer üòÅ
what a great guy the man behind him is trying to usher him to continue walking but he stays to keep talking with the girls
say what you want about his movies but will smith is and always will be a stand up guy
he‚Äôll always be my fresh prince well and now a genie too
will smith has been in several stinkers lately and honestly i think most of the time when he‚Äôs acting he‚Äôs just ‚Äúbeing will smith‚Äù rather than assuming the role of his character but that‚Äôs partially the fault of the people who write roles for him any minor gripes i may have with him and with disney producing soulless cash ins and destroying the movie industry i cannot find it in myself not to like the guy for at least seeming genuine and kind
the girls were never heard from again the mother s wish came true
that is actually really cute and sweet melted my cold black heart
so as a year old guy i was really let down when i didn‚Äôt get to see them meet princess jasmine
i love will smith he really is one of those fantastic actors who is also an awesome human being
the guy with him looks like he‚Äôs adjusting his gun so the kids can‚Äôt see it
i‚Äôll admit i was worried when i saw they had cast will smith as the genie i was prejudiced against will and i was wrong to be he nailed it he‚Äôs a national treasure as was robin williams
will smith is the most wonderful human who walked the earth thank you will for all the joy you are bringing
guy on the right yeah that s absolutely the best time to check your gun
guy in the background is staring at the kids like make a move kid i wish you would then the girl in the black dress moved up a little more and he moved in ready to eliminate the obvious threat
that s mila and her sister those kids her skits are great i ve seen them in the instagram
i like to rag on will as much as the next guy but on a real note he really is one of the few genuine people left in hollywood who do their work for others gotta love him and his family mad props
nothing against will smith but wonder if he would have realistically done that if the camera s won t rolling
i am pleasantly surprised that this comment section is not full of will smith hate and scepticism towards this interaction being genuine usually reddit says how he s always an asshole to fans
as sweet and wholesome as this is the film is still shit
bodyguard nervously touching his right hip holster as he assesses the threat to his principal
what a class act and a really nice guy i wish him the sucess
hey yo mr s you maybe want me to take care o deese kids for ya
more proof that will smith is one of the most wholesome people out there
the guy behind will smith looks like he gonna fuking murder him tf
what a lovely guys an absolutely fantastic actor as well loved the role of will smith in aladdin
security guy behind him was so ready to tackle those kids if they tried anything
that bodyguard really looked like he was getting ready to choke hold those kids
sacha baron cohen is the best example of staying in character off set his interviews are particularly fun to watch
what a guy and he doesnt have to cuss in his raps to sell records
say what you want about his acting i don‚Äôt think anyone can say that will smith isn‚Äôt a great person
is that his bodyguard was he adjusting his little gun under his shirt
aww what a guy and what adorable girls any video of them actually meeting
man we were talking about him in my ethics class on how his children‚Äôs success or lack there of has in some ways hurt his image the topic was ‚Äúhollywood ethics‚Äù and why tabloids and paparazzi and media in general impact the country was bizarre still those of us who remember big willy from east philly was a tripe threat and an overall great man this just reminds me of that guy
that s cute but i feel bad they had to watch that movie lol
jesus look at the mark behind will being all serious its two little girls relax bro
‚Äúi‚Äôm pretending to be a normal person‚Äù in character i was expecting genie stuff
famous actors and musicians who understand the minds of children and keep the stories and dreams alive are the real celebrities
two thoughts that s cute as hell first time ever that a black man was allowed to take two little white girls and no one seemed to care
i don t give a fuck about this new movie and also i m not made of fucking stone good job will
damn that sucks i know what it s like to lose a pet stay strong
fifteen years is a long time i understand your loss never thought the great love of my life would be a dog but it turned out that way sincere condolences
i empathize thank you for sharing your buddy with us fifteen years is definitely something to celebrate but it really never seems like enough with a good dog and friend like that i‚Äôm sorry for your loss
is it jointed or does it always have the paw up like that i d like to see this from other angles we see a lot of felted stuffed animals in this sub but not a lot of posable ones if this one is that s actually pretty cool anyway posable or not the detail is insane on this anyone know the artist
first post plz be kind op this is your rd post in this sub
just so you know that made a grown man in his fifties cry on the toilet user name checks out
how sad do you actually have to be to repost things and pretend like they are yours especially saying it‚Äôs your first post when it clearly isn‚Äôt some of you blokes love reddit too much
when you‚Äôre obsessed with finding leaf clovers that dog is just in the way
i hope you named it meringue amp x b it looks like the meringue topping on pie amp x b almost looks like a bobble head doll you used to see on car dashes amp x b very cute
they look super cute until they get wet then you realize how much they look like rats
do you have amnesia orrrrrr you like to steal other people‚Äôs photos and post not your first by any stretch
tbh i see this as the three evolutions of a pokemon what goodboye is evolving
you can clearly see that awkward teenage phase complete with questionable hairdo
he got more and more heckin bamboozled as he grew up

‚ô´ i m gonna take my dogs to the old town road we gonna riiiiddddeeee till we can t no moh ‚ô´
does anyone know some cool facts about bernese mountain dogs
another settlement needs your help ill mark it on your map
i don t know a lot about yeehaw style but that is one clean modern looking cowboy hat
never heard of him i m about sure that he is a rap artist but the other is hoping he is a sculptor
ok this guy is everywhere now im starting to get suspicious
"doggies in my arms
horsies in the farms
got me a new hat
this ones a white matte"
they where actually nas dogs this unoriginal twat just stole them too
is he a rapper that doesn‚Äôt have tattoos i thought this kind of people went extinct
i can t tell are those bermese mountain dogs or black tri australian shepherds
i m gonna take my pups to the living room i m gonna peeeet till i can t no more
im a take my pup to the old town park were gonna playyyy till we cant no more
are those burnese mountain dogs they are adorable they look so chill and happy
did those horses get a haircut they look strange all jokes aside lil nas is great and so are those puppies
i just played counter strike with a guy named lil nas x is that you lmao
he seems like the type to take care of them unlike riff raff who has a different dog every year
"fun fact no reputable breeder would sell siblings from a litter together this is due to littermate syndrome ‚Äúlittermate syndrome‚Äù is based on anecdotal evidence that often two siblings bought together bond intensely with each other to the exclusion of their human family
puppies with littermate syndrome often suffer from intense separation anxiety when apart conversely one of the two may be dangerously aggressive toward the other many dog behavior experts agree it‚Äôs a bad idea to bring home a pair of puppies from the same litter"
sputter is he could he be appropriating white culture with that hat this is completely unacceptable and i will stop listening to old town road for hours on loop
"got the doggos in the back
wagon is attached
bike is matte black
got the boots that s black to match"
if dogs were pokemon bernese mountain dogs look like the evolved version of cavalier king charles spaniels
yeaah i m gonna take my dogs to thw old town road i m gonna waalk em till i can t no more i m gonna take my dogs to thw old town road i m gonna waalk em till i can t no more i got the
ahh that old trick post a picture of a monkey doing something that white humans do as a matter of course for dat sweet karma high that subhuman is going to be surprised when he takes them to the fighting ring just because they beez big dawgs doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre good for fighting
his stage name sounds like he used what s is your raper name where first letter of your name got him lil and birthday got him nas and he added x at the end so its not that obvious
i hope those dogs bite him harder then he bit tracy
gone take my pups to the doggy park gonna plaaaaay till they can t no more
aww that s so cute they look blow dried very floofy
he really adopted that country cowboy style ever since old town road blew up
forgive me for being late to the party but what happened to lil nas i through ix
ya know i saw the name and expected to see a sound cloud rapper but every time i see this guy all i can think is that he looks like a genuinely good and caring person
"gonna take my doggies to the old town road gonna
feeeetch till i caint no more"
im so interested to learn more about his past and what made him to be such a good person without trying to sound like an ass a good majority of artists in the same genre who boast about big stacks of money and women and drugs this guy just seems like he wants to make people happy makes him so much more interesting
i like this guy a lot currently but his name makes me laugh because it sounds like something the website suggested after you tried to make like usernames and they were all taken already
at least he has one redeeming quality because his music is absolute shit
for a moment i thought he was dressed as cowboy curtis
did this guy just take nas name and add stuff to make it his own
why does he look like a young stanley from the office
this guy just seems to be having a hell of a time being himself he doesn t worry about being hood or black enough he s out here living life his way love it
lil nas x he just made his name out of previous rapper names
i‚Äôm gonna lick my bone at the old dog park i‚Äôm gonna bark till i can‚Äôt no more i got the humans in the back
is this the same baby in the vid of them stretching after being unswaddled
but attached to that head is the rock hard body of a beautiful adult man
i‚Äôd look at my mom that way too if she was that attractive
this just made me all warm inside the love is so pure lt
this was cute a year ago when it was posted along with last month and days ago thanks for the repost
normally i m not into cute babies video or pics but this this is seriously cute
i ve seen this so many times and each time it melts my heart
why are babies at their absolute peak of cuteness when it‚Äôs the middle of the night damn
am i the only freaked out by the baby i thought something evil was going to happen
i have one of these little psychos in my home right now she will not sleep without me or mommy looking her right in the eye no games no reddit eyeball or we re all staying awake i work insane hours and would not trade sleepless nights with her for anything
usually i don‚Äôt find babies cute give me a puppy any day but this one is a rare exception she or he is beyond perfect
isn t she the most beautiful precious thing you ve ever seen
that baby s going to murder you you can see the evil glint in his eye
this video always reminds me that i do want kids eventually ugh my ovaries
find you a man the way this kid looks at his mom and the camera
good lord this has been reposted so many times you can the pixel break down
the face you make when you are about to drink from some tiddies
holy shit i want one or ten can‚Äôt decide adorable as ever
it‚Äôs the face of victory heading to the gym rn kid woke me up before the alarm rang and started to say ‚Äúyou slept enough you should really wake up‚Äù as soon as i realized kid already snuck into bed with his ipad same expression and here i am gym it is
get someone who looks at you like this baby looks at its mom
idk their hyper awareness and timing gives me the creeps honestly lol
this is seriously one of the cutest babies i ve ever seen
omg that baby is absolutely adorable i m normally not drooling over babies but this one is just too cute lt
omg i want one üë∂üèº oh wait a sec caught up in the cuteness i m better now
man that is just too cute and put a huge smile on my face i really needed that after the miserable day i ve had
too cute it‚Äôs probably am and that little one is ready to take on the world
i hope she doesn‚Äôt roll over in her sleep cause that baby is too cute
that baby could be the star of a show called babies i don t care about
i swear that baby could be the front cover of a book called babies i don t care about
i have two little babies and i get these moments everyday makes life worth living the sadness of it all being over one day is the only thing that doesn t make it perfect
this is literally how i look when i‚Äôm laying next to a girl this is adorable
every time i see a baby i think about how incredible every part of human life is i look down at my ‚Äô ‚Äù tall body and though it‚Äôs short compared to other adults i marvel at how i used to be an infant no more than inches tall the fact that my body has grown more than times my height when i was born almost makes my jaw drop when i think about it the most complex inner workings of my body were all there when i was born perfectly functioning long before my birth they are the same ones i was born with only larger when i was depressed in my mid teens i used a stethoscope to ward of suicidal thoughts i found it therapeutic because i reminded myself listening to my heartbeat of the miracle of my mere existence
i think this just might be the cutest baby in the world
i really wanted mom to look back into her daughter‚Äôs eyes i was kind of sad that the baby was like ‚Äúmom hi üòÅ‚Äù but mom just put the phone in her face more üò¢
holy fuck there are some people voting who have issues tonight hating others more won t make you hate yourself less downvoters
any time i see a human child on here i am going to voice my displeasure and i don‚Äôt give a shit who that upsets less crotch spawn more meow woof bark honk oink hsss pls
a full head of dark hair is way op for tiny baby cuteness i m sure that kid is just as derpy as all the other kids by now
i love this but that face on the baby makes me think it took a shit in the bed
that baby loves her momma it s moments like these that gives me hope in our future awesome awesome
look at that adorably wide awake baby looking so ready for the day even though it‚Äôs probably am
this has been around for years i would love to see an updated picture of this beautiful child
i legitimately need drugs to be as happy as that baby is
i don t normally like babies but that is one cute baby
i have a dear old deaf dog too it kinda breaks my heart that what is seemingly such an important sense for a dog is something she no longer has however being able to sneak up on her and seeing the immediate excitement once she realizes i‚Äôm there makes it all worth it
so i guess that means smell isn t able to wake a dog up like hearing can you d think with it being their strongest sense it would
she is precious my dog went dead toward the end of her life and it broke my heart to know she couldn t hear me tell her i loved her but i think she knew
it s amazing to me that dogs can go from asleep to excited in an instant i understand that this is likely a survival instinct but still adorable i hope you ve given the pup all the treats and all the cuddles
ours always sleeps by the door so she knows when we get home
i m not sure how you could be more awwwww than that
excuse me but that is the first time i see people keep their dogs in a cage and it is so small i am sorry for him
awwww i love she went from and jumped up when she saw you were home üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèºüòÅüòÅüíôüíôüíôüíôüíô
we once had a litter of border collies and one was deaf and was also white apparently most sheep farmers won‚Äôt buy white collies because they have a higher chance of being deaf is this true
im surprised he didnt feel the vibration of the door or footsteps
animals with white fur including dalmatians are usually completely deaf or cant hear out of one ear
what‚Äôs the point of owning a dog if you keep it locked up in a kennel all day i will never understand people keeping your dogs locked in kennels literally makes them go crazy don‚Äôt get another dog
you re alright man giving an animal that s generally at a severe disadvantage in society a good home like that is something special the world needs more people like you although it means shit just saying it i ll say thank you anyways for acting on your good heart
i don t why the people put a dog in a cage and so small to sad üòî
honestly all i see in this video is a little doggo very bored in a ridiculous tiny cage being happy to be release shame on you you don t deserve his love
so the dogs in a cage the whole day doing time for a crime he never committed
my dog is blind due to her old age sometimes i wish she was deaf instead
it s crate training did it with my first pup because he d get into everything and destroy stuff eventually he didn t need it so we sold it he recently passed and our new pup is in a baby pen instead bigger than a uncomfortable crate and more space
was he in a cage the whole day i understand if he was in there while he sleeps but the whole day while you re at work that s just cruel
i don t crate my dog personally i just don t think it is as detrimental to their health or wellbeing as everyone is making it out to be all of the crated dogs i ve met are just as happy and social as any other do what works for your dog and yourself there are plenty of animals going through far worse at our hands we should be investing our energy on
get that dog out of the cage now no excuses if you can t provide an environment for your pet where they don t have to locked in a box for half their life you don t deserve to own one
i feel bad because he she can never be told they‚Äôre a good boy girl
why do you keep your dog friend in a smallest cage ever what the f
sleeping like it hasn t a care or worry in the world what a happy little fellow
this looks like a spotted version of my dog anubis too cute i even get a bow from my dog too
why is it in a cage designed for a rabbit this is so cruel that cage is tiny wtf
so you keep your dog locked up all the time imho that makes you a warden and not his friend doesn t matter much in the grand scheme of things but know this i hate you some people shouldn t have dogs you probably would declaw a cat if you owned one
how come she stays in the crate what if theres a fire and she cant get out
why the fuck is it locked in a tiny ass crate is it in there whole day when you are out
awww lt our pup is now and has gone quite deaf not completely and it s amazing to see how much more relaxed she is and how deeply she can sleep now she s a hyperactive and used to be hyperaware border collie so in her case i think it even did her some good
seems like animal cruelty to me at least keep the cage open
she‚Äôs so excited that you‚Äôre the first one she sees when she wakes up ‚ù§Ô∏è
is this a us thing putting your dogs in prison during the day
how do you take them for walks can they just not go off the lead since presumably you can t call them back
i‚Äôm actually surprised how many people over here complaint about the crate people explained already it‚Äôs crate cage training just like how we humans let a baby screen inside their crib when sleep training but then again some people complain about a cage that‚Äôs very temporary and those same people live in a sq apartment and own a husky that gets walks a day maybe three
do you keep that poor animal locked in a cage i d like to see the video of you locked in a cage
and all i can think about is if there is a fire and that poor dog is locked in its cage
putting aside my opinions about having dogs in cages for extended periods of time why no water that just seems extra cruel to me
i‚Äôve grown up with dogs my whole life and many of them being seeing eye dogs for my blind uncle we would never ever put a dog in a cage that type of dog is a cattle dog too they have exorbitant amounts of energy maybe the owner of the dog in this video should have thought about that before getting him they can‚Äôt be left alone all day especially not in a cage on a side note in california where i am from it is illegal to leave your dog in a car with the windows up if it‚Äôs on a hot day i‚Äôve seen people actually break a cars window to get the dog out and then call the police dogs have a lot of rights here i‚Äôm surprised cages like this are legal i just keep thinking about what if there was a fire
i used to have a deaf dog meg she was the family dog before i was even born and was me and my brothers body guard she even knew my mom was pregnant before my mom did we‚Äôd boop her nose if she did something wrong she‚Äôd run when she saw us run and walk when she saw us walk she was the best girl and i‚Äôll always remember her as proof that special needs animals are some of the best animals out there
i wonder if its possible to give animals hearing aids implants
it‚Äôs crazy making to see how many commenters don‚Äôt know what crate training is people do some freaking research a million props to op for having the patience and taking the time to rescue a pup with a disability
my puppy sleeps like that too seeing a german shepherd in that position cracks me up every morning
why is he in a small jail not the right word sorry i forgot the name in english
does nobody care that the poor puppy is in a tiny cage all day
is it just me that hates cages poor thing cant even walk around
please tell me i m not the only one that would be calling out to their deaf dog when i came home even though i know it cannot hear me
this is adorable i had a deaf golden retriever growing up and it was a similar situation when coming home from school
beautiful dog op i crate my dog too she loves her crate when i‚Äôm home and not able to provide cuddles she ends up chilling in her crate anyways we‚Äôre terrible people op our dogs should be taken and given to people that will provide better care for these poor animals üòí
it s crazy to think that animals that ate born deaf or blind just have no idea that that sense is actually a thing i understand that humans born this way also can t really understand what that sense is like but they learn that they are missing that sense and ability now the people and animals born deaf and blind out there that s crazy to think about it too
you really should get a little water container that snaps to the metal wires of the kennel dogs need to have water all the time
why is she confined to such a tiny cage it seems kind of cruel as her body just fits the size and all she can do is lay in it shouldn t the door be always open unless in transit
i am shocked about fact that the first comment mentioning cage and no water is so low with just few upvotes what kind of people are here it seemed like cool comunity no swearing nor making fun of anyone but maybe its just alibism and hypocricy i am now trying reddit for third time and just like before after few days i am sayin goodbye and its for good now
people who put their dog in a cage deserve a special separate place in hell a x pond of lava for example
myriad of visceral comments here historically we have never crate trained our dogs the foster trainers that rescued her are crate training pros and suggested we continue for consistency sake appreciate the feedback re crate size and water but she s never in there more than a couple of hours a few days per week friendly reminder she was born completely deaf this adds much nuance to training any nine month old especially a herder breed when we adopted her we learned basic signing that she understands but this remains a work in progress she has come a long way since being abandoned in a dump with her new born siblings nine months ago she genuinely loves her crate and her other two beds she has no preference where she sleeps so long as she can make eye contact with us we thought we were close to keeping her crate free when alone until she ignited the gas range obviously we still have some work to do we work from home and it is rare that she is in the crate door closed for more than a couple hours this is week three for us and things are progressing well the purpose for posting this vid was to demonstrate how to wake a deaf dog another user posted something similar their relationship is more mature than ours ultimately any dog with whatever special need blind deaf amputee ptsd etc is equally capable of loving pleasing so don t rule them out they re all special and take a piece of our hearts when they pass but this one may just be our best yet
someone get this doggo a denim vest with some patches on it
this good boi needs a leather jacket motorcycle spiked collar and his own mad max movie
cut but good thing you didn t approach it in case mom s around and in a panic the doe s mother may have been around too
haha it s all fun and games until mama catches you with her baby hospital octothorp
i kinda think it might be a good albeit difficult thing to do to yell and scare the hell out of little baby wild animals when they approach the reason being that you want to make them safe and survive longer but trusting humans can be really harmful to that end
makes me worry about where the mom is why isn t she by him i hope it s not a bambi situation dx
welp you‚Äôre officially a disney princess now congrats
i saw something on natgeo onetime about something similar they said a fawn that approaches humans probably is separated from its mom and is looking for food help idk but that was a small fawn so maybe
as much as i would love to interact with some wild animals they really need to be afraid of humans too many jerks in the world
can i go out on a limb and guess you re somewhere in new york state
brother nature is never there when you need him most
little guy had to run off when he heard barnabi buckle hooves jr i m counting to three and you better be back in your den
omg i want to hug this baby but i also want to yell at it not trust humans because i saw bambi
no no youre kidding me no i cannot handle it please excuse me i‚Äôm from a city i cannot believe we live in a world where people can have such magical moments like this i cannot believe it my heart can‚Äôt handle it this is too cute
you should narrate things your voice could out me to sleep lmao
the lil clip clops of his lil hooves on the pavement
your mom is dead this videographer is the man who killed her run
with the fawn traveling in the tall grass it s like a real life pokemon encounter
reminds me of those times where you re out in public following your parent around jackassing around and not paying attention then the person speaks and you realize its not your parent and you somehow ended up following some random stranger so you take off humiliated
i love how it s still learning to coordinate his legs and feet like first this front foot goes forward then this back foot then the other front foot then this other back leg repeat
i saw a doe with a cute little bugger today mom walked behind some bushes after a short stare down a minute later i went to look and they were gone should be some nice weather here for the next several days i hope they have a nice week
i feel like all the little deer s friends were watching and this was some kind of gang initiation
dog rings bell shame op wait wha founds himself naked and surrounded by people
i was praying for cute petting on my mind but it didn t happen now i feel sadüò≠
remebemer to never touch them their mom will smell human scent and she may abandon her baby
he says don t be scared and it starts running away p
look at those shaky little gangly legs it s walking on ‚ù§Ô∏è
she was young and does not know to be cautious yet its best to not approach them and feed them they should have a healthy fear of humans to keep themselves safe from harm i do have to say that was really really sweet its so hard to not to want to be up close to them and show warmth
oh my heart this is cgi right oh lawd what a clear plot oh hai friend wanna play oh wait you re not the right kind of friend nevermind just passin through
you have a really pleasant voice to listen to just in case you don t hear that often
this reminds me of the time i took a trip to yosemite national park err something like that ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄ and while my cabin mates and i were sleeping apparently a family of deer were walking in front of our cabin door at least that s what we heard the next morning from everyone who was still awake that night
she is a very cute and very small baby that s why she was afraid of you
you smell like those places my mom puts me to wait securely for her
anyone else more terrified when you see a baby wild animal rather than a full grown animal
this is kinda how the eastern conference finals went
i was so scared the op will touch it glad they didnt
pure unadulterated beauty and innocence the love of all things never to do harm kept alive generation after generation on the backbone of an oh shit response so violent and on que it s a miracle predators ever catch the things
glad he ran off don t interact with wild animals folks if they get accustomed to humans they ll eventually have to be euthanized killed
that s a weird pup oh shouldn t you be lying still where your mom told you to wait
oh hi wait are you going to put this on reddit runs away
i would pay for you to read me bedtime stories you have a very pleasant voice
me when i accidentally followed some lady in the store and realized it wasn t my mom
that is one rebel kid he s suppose to wait for his mom like a good kid hiding in the bush but instead he literally disobeyed and ventured out to the open field he will be grounded when his mom gets back
sadly because it s wondering around alone it s probably dinner by now
you re lucky the mother wasn t there their claws are like inches long
awww the mommy is dead and this little thing is looking for some food rip little fella
i would love one of these but they re a little dear
the way it walked made me think it was an alien at first looks so weird from that angle
your voice is amazing i could see you narrating movies or doing audio books üòÇüòÇ
you didn t move so it didn t notice you immediately when you started moving it ran away
oh hi wait are you going to put this on reddit runs away
one thing can be deduced for certain and that is that op is not joe rogan
i mean i know it s wrong but i d still adopt him or her
‚Äúmr tough guy‚Äù absolutely what nobody was thinking but it made me chuckle
oooppppsss wrong mommy kinda like when you were a kid and walked up to the wrong woman and thought it was your mom
are you sure it wasn t trying to lead you to its fallen mother why didn t you follow bambi d
this dude is the luckiest man on the planet deer run away if they see a human walking in the other direction damn
at first i thought it was a kitten then i thought it was a dog but it was a doe a deer a female deer
i found a newborn little fella at my work today as well
something about the way that baby deer walk just melts my heart
your new cologne fresh sprouts of spring is just too good
a wild ‚Äúdeer‚Äù appeared in the tall brush squirtle go
to be honest you should have shooed him off and make sure that he was afraid of people
everyone at office this am droan droan droan me is dat a little baby deer aww its just a liddle baby deer
poor baby was lost from mom its good she took off tho she should be afraid of humans the ones who aren t are the ones who get into trouble
a little back story i saw mom on the way over what i didn t see was this little guy mom ran off and after this video happened i didn t think it was a good idea to hang around i am going to go back today and make sure mom did come back i will bring some food with me
my great grandmother had a pet deer they tried so many times to take it out into the woods behind their house but it just kept coming back
this made me think of finding nemo ooh look at me i m gonna go touch the human
yeah i would be a mixed bag of omg let me love you shit where s your mom she ll kill me
my internet is crappy so i watched this video the first time threw like that s a weird cat
yeah cwd has definitely hit the northeast really hard i hate to hear you can‚Äôt find any cwd scares the shit out of me
it would of came to you if you stopped talking and put your hand out as acceptance
bambi has come looking for the human being who made a lead object go fast at his mom
proof that kids no matter what species are super curious it s the social ecosystem that teach the kids how to fear and doubt
lil nas x so far has seemed like one of those celebrities that you‚Äôre happy he‚Äôs famous
come on now we have seen this enough we all enjoy the pics but not this much
no better decision has ever been made as buying two puppies at once instead of one good luck to him that their litermate syndrome isn t too drastic
that last picture is adorable i honestly don t know who looks happier the dogs or him
that would be a tough decision looks like he made the right one
i recognize this guy s face was he recently on the front page for something else
i love this everytime i see big cats doing things my kitty does it touches me in a special way üòä
i just want to pet his chest looks so cute but i know i‚Äôd probably get the hind paw scratches lol
the lost kingdom is one of my favorite spots at the tulsa zoo
the classic go on rub my belly i promise it will be fine pose
not gonna lie i thought that was a guy in a suit for just a second
big cats should get special heavy duty cardboard boxes so they can get the full cardboard box experience
so i heard from this tiny version of me that boxes are the best beds so i tried to see if i fits and i can confirm i have been missing out so far
all that is needed is a sign saying fort big asshole
me also me me nobody everybody my mom me observe everyon me nobody
intelligent brain that is an apex predator that could rip you apart just by accident you need to stay away the brain i have instead hehe cute kitty wanna pet
love cats i always feed homeless cats near my house i have cats these are amazing animals be it a big tiger or an ordinary cat people be kinder to them please
i just noticed the second tiger in the background to the right
a cat is a cat i played get the string using a long piece of grass with a cougar at the zoo too it loved it lmao
i want to rub his belly but i know i‚Äôd lose my arm including my head too
this is why i couldn t be a zoo keeper i d die in a scritches related accident
i know it s a trap but i want to rub his belly so badly
i wonder if the zoo could get an amazon prime account best boxes ever
no box is too small no cat is too big this are our words son the words of the house cats
this pic would be so much better if this tiger was out in the wild aka its natural habitat
decides which of my arms i could live without i need to pet a tiger
my subconscious that s a hige fucking animal who will turn you into it s snack if you look at it funny stay away me eh fuck it i still wanna pet rub it
he looks curious and scared shitless at the same time i want one
how old is he seems a tad bit young to be adopted at a shelter
that s it i m done scrolling for the night so adorable üòç
she is the cutest thing i have seen all day today hello lulu
i would happily make him mine too such a handsome little one üòª‚ù§
look john i ve had a lot of fun here and how do you know i wouldn t be missed
my friend has a small yellow parakeet named ringo the birb and the little kitty are both equally floofy and cute
oh yeah there‚Äôs a devious master plan behind those innocent looking eyes
destined to play drums in the all feline band the kittles one day he will meet the queen
if i ever got an orange cat i would name him loki or little orange kitten
manipulation looked at you with that face for seconds
i don‚Äôt understand how animal foster care works how do you have the strength to give them away
i thought for a second someone posted my kitten on reddit my new baby looks just like yours very handsome orange kitty you ve got thereüòâ
damn next thing you know cats will be manipulating our political decisions and ultimately take over the world
orange tabbies cannot be fostered they adopt the first hooman they make eye contact with
yay i love a foster fail my year old ginger was one too
i m pretty sure there wasn t really much manipulation here like come on look at that face how can you not keep that sweetness ü§©ü§ó
this looks like the beginning of a beautiful friendship
he is a crafty little guy very cute too i think he made a good choice best wishes to you both
my dogs name is ringo because his tail sounds like drumming when he wags it
ginger cats learn the puss in boots look from birth that s how my one sunk her claws into my soul
maybe off topic but do you need to go through some tests or meet some requirements to foster
total manipulated just wait till ringo insist there‚Äôs no food but in fact there is food
this is why i could never foster kittens i would have to keep them all
lovely name we have a cat thats nearly identical in its fur to yours and we named him zingo funny coincidence
oh my kitty is this pale ginger colour and his name is ringo too
he sure looks cold and calculating a bit like my children
there s something about ginger tabbies my gary manipulated me into keeping him years ago when i found him on the sidewalk in front of my house sneaky bastages
this is why i could never foster cats not because i dont like cats it s because one look of the cute little shits face each time i d have to keep them all
what do you mean manipulated you were his bitches the moment he set foot paw in his home
i have a orange tom cat named ringo hopefully yours is just as snuggly
foster failure we have one as well good looking kitty
which ringo is he named after starr or the japanese word for apple
do you have a dog named paul and a bird named john and a rabbit named george if so i can and will ransack your house for your beatles pets üòâ
my kitten looks exactly the same i posted a pic of him amp it got like upvotes wtf reddit
you were putty in his ginger paws enjoy i hope he has a nap buddy nap buddies are important
so in your own time please tell me why you ll be sending me back to the shelter to sleep all alone and not stay here with you in your comfortable home üòøüòøüòø
how can you not look at that sweet little face congratulations
all be warned do not underestimate the power of these types of manipulations we too have a foster fail that makes us very happy congratulations on the new addition op ringo is adorable
my dog leaves chocolate kisses in my yard all the time too
pickles was the name i was going to give to my first pet
my sister has a pug named pickles yay for corgi pickles
i had a normal size hershey kiss once i believe they are made of cat shit
shouldn‚Äôt he be out in the woods somewhere or other though
i bet that is a hot water bottle in the sock by his back
shawn wasabi‚Äôs song otter pop must be played at all times today
i fucking love otters this one is just the cutest little thing
i don‚Äôt mean to be dramatic but i would die for this otter i love you bby stay safe
he sleeping knowing im a disappointment to my family
"honey came in and she caught me red handed
creepin with the girl next door"
this is basically the equivalent of cersei and jaime being caught by bran but bran fights back this time
that orange cat has fucked up both of those cats in the past this is my moped chumps
the black cat looked legitimately hurt when the tabby ran
black cat is like she s behind me isn t she i swear this is not what it looks like
come on hooman you know puppies need to stay warm let me help you
not to take away from the adorableness but i wonder whether or not this dog was trained to tuck in the baby if so that s amazing training if the dog did this on its own volition that s amazing instinct and sweet as hell it s just amazing all around dogs are amazing
this is y most humans don t deserve dogs everything about them is amazing we all pale n their compassion and humanity their hearts r so pure and wonderful and uncorrupted
‚Äúmini human you have no fur to protect you from the borfin‚Äô shivers here accept this weird smell fake fur as a replacement do not fret i will even help you put it on ‚Äù
i can t tell if he just wants to cover him up wants him to move out of his spot or to get up and play the covering up is cute but those nudges are fierce
not to be that pessimistic ass and i keep saying that and still do it on reddit but that seems really irresponsible that looks like a super newborn infant and a very large dog i don t care how well trained a dog is that looks like danger waiting to happen and not funny or aww at all one quick loud noise and snap bite and this is a dead baby i just don t get why you would ever put your newborn near any animal let alone a large dog that is apparently very active i thought new parents were usually more protective not oh the dog is super nice he doesn t even bark at the squirrels in the back yard and let them loose around a newborn baby
seeing a little baby sleeping on their tummy like that is giving me hella anxiety
that is beyond adorable cross species affection for the young is the purest form of love it s easy to care for your own but to care for the vulnerable of another species is truly something special and i wonder when this baby grows up or years from now will he see this video and shed a tear as he holds a puppy of his own in his arms
first thing i saw on reddit this morning reminds me of my dog not wanting to leave my sons side for the first year
do i have to do everything around the house karen it s not even my baby
some animals will try to wake babies if they think something is wrong my gs tried to get my niece off the floor when she was throwing a fit
god cannot commit sin god is perfect anyone god picks is also perfect by extension his servants can t commit sin
ted is like model perfect i wanna bury my face in that sweet fur such a sweet baby
that s pretty much how it works cat chooses the person
there is a cat that shows up at my house in the morning usually around the time we feed our dog i named her noisy because she meows until someone feeds her then she leaves
meahaha silly humans give me the munchies or i‚Äôll be grumpy
happens put in the country all the time one of our current cats just showed up one day a couple years ago and there s another that s pretty much always here but not really very tame the other cats hate him and he doesn t really like them either and he s kinda scared of humans and only lets you pet him when he wants food
beautiful cat but does this mean you only visit your grandma once a year
hold up the cat adopted ur grandparents is that supposed to be some english expression
this cat is identical to mine üò≥ and he adopted us as well a few years back i honestly did a double take thinking it was my sir kittylot for a sec they must be a smart breed who pick their own loving families üòÖ
that s the first cat i ve seen who seems to give a shit
thats sentence is how you know the cat is a cat you dont adopt a cat he adopts you
i love the red points on his coat we have a red point siamese absolutely stunning give ted some love for me
you are my humans now don t try to fight it you will only make it harder on yourselves
check if hes chipped for fuck sake that could be someones beloved pet that got lost
i love it when animals adopt humans i worked overseas and the local cats were kept around to keep the rodents away so the veterinarians that took care of the k units would also take care of the cats they would wander around and adopt the human they liked best they would even wait at your door when they knew your shift was ending just for some loving
have a neighborhood cat that looks just like that named henry that the entire neighborhood has loved
like a wise man once told me you don t choose the cat the cat chooses you
my hamster was called ted and he was the exact same colour he died about a year ago i m glad he s been reborn and has a new home
ted as in ted bundy serial killer with the killer looks comes back as a cat lmao
wow he looks identical to a cat that adopted me yeeeears ago called teddy
as a former owner of a tan cat named teddy i can confirm this is how teds roll
holy crap ted looks so similar to my cat but i don‚Äôt know how to upload images
so nice of him to adopt your grandparents üòâ he looks beautiful and probably as nice as he looks hope he can spend the rest of his life with your grandparents üêàüíô
i have a flame point siamese they are something else for sure ‚ù§Ô∏è
can confirm have had cats adopt me and just start living with me one of them is the goofiest cat i‚Äôve had who‚Äôs owners didn‚Äôt update his chip after they moved other died a couple years later of hyper water tension from unknown causes but was lovely all the same
when my son bought his house it came with an outside cat that adopted the previous owners cat has a heated little hut and gets canned food and fresh water i guess the cat really owns the house and lets my son live there üòÉ cats are pretty clever
aww he looks almost exactly like our cat who also basically adopted us a while back lol
hmmm it seems that i have found my mew home i might adopt some humans later
cats really do be just adopting people and shit like oh i m tired of trying to find my own food this seems like a good person house
looks just like the cat i had to put down after years together damn i miss her
gt he adopted us most accurate description of cat human relationship ever
my grandparents are the same they have a big tray down in their barn that they keep filled with cat food and have taken in so many stray cats they re mostly feral but let my grandparents around them
i had a cat named moon that looked exactly like ted
cats are unusual creatures grandma s cat lived years when grandma got sick and came down he sat on it every day after a while he died and with grandma all right and inexplicably she was cured
my parents had two cats neither one was theirs they just showed up one got eaten by a neighbor dog don t know what happened to the other one
wait i‚Äôm sorry i don‚Äôt wanna get wooshed but the cat adopted you
something about this picture the wood the paint the leaves on the deck maybe even ted this picture is so relaxing to me
aw what a sweetheart there is nothing like being adopted by animals
so this is what he does when he isn‚Äôt catching his girl with a gray tabby
ted pays for food and medical bills impressive animal
about years ago we owned three very well looked after cats one day we‚Äôre searching for one of them and we find him sitting in our neighbours window turns out he decided to adopt himself to our neighbours they grew to love him despite one of them being allergic and after about a year we moved and let him stay with them
cats don t adopt humans it s viceversa you dumn birches
grandmas are just cat magnets i ve had two grandmas adopted by cats one of them is a big fluffy feral cat who might as well not exist if she hears any strangers
that seems to be a grandma thing years ago a stray dog adopted my grandma she only called him dog and complained to everyone that she didn t want any pets she secretly loved that dog and ended up caring for him for years
in soviet russia you do not adopt cat cat adopt you
i have so enjoyed spending part of my morning getting to know ted and reading heartwarming stories i have so many wonderful memories of my cats all of whom had big personalities thank you ted and others
he looks just like my cat we just had to put down he‚Äôs so pretty
ted has a serious chris hemsworth vibe and look about him good catto
she truly understands the relatuonship it s the cat that adopted her not the other way around
i had a cat who wandered onto my property one day howling we brought her inside and she stayed forever
i never get tired of seeing cats part beautiful part mysterious part dopey everything i love about any living creature
can we talk about op did not visit grandma for about one year
this is how you get cats i‚Äôve been adopted by every cat i‚Äôve ever had since i was i‚Äôm now
i love how it s he adopted us instead of we adopted him cats be on a whole new level
there s a cat that has taken a liking to our house and keeps accidentally getting let in my cat is not having it and goes absolute ape shit on it
grandma gets it humans dont adopt cats cats adopt humans
omfg we had a cat named teddy who adopted us he looked just like your cat he passed away when i was in high school lived until he was give your ted a snuggle for me
we have one of those fat boy stares at me through the window until i feed him
he adopted us is the only way to truly obtain a cat one does not adopt a cat the cat must accept you into its inner circle
are you now listening to ted s story of how he met your grandmother that sounds suspiciously like he d rather be living at some other old ladies house
i wonder if you can adopt a human cats and humans have a somewhat symbiotic relationship
so when you last visited your grandma was even more than ‚Äúabout a year ago‚Äù shame on you
for a min i thought this was my cat he looks identical these type of cats are such sweetheart
what a lovely thing to say ‚ù§Ô∏è ted looks very contented and happy nicely tucked in paws
cats always push their whiskers forward when they‚Äôre happy
it was more like a hiring process for us a beautiful but very wary white cat started to hang around we fed her and made her a little hut but it was months before we passed probation and she allowed us to stroke her she likes head scratches now but on no account are we allowed to pick her up that s overstepping the mark on a serious note i d love to get her to the vet have her checked over and vaccinated but i m scared of overstressing her and she might take off and not come back any advice anyone i d also like to bring her inside but same applies i don t want to freak her out
it‚Äôs not a baby its a dumbo octopus which means its cute like that throughout its life
honestly this is so cute it doesn t look real i actually thought it was an animated gif the first time i saw it
a sequel to finding nemo where the main character is a baby octopus with a short tentacle let the adventure begin
helen keller could have come up with a more accurate title
it should be a full grown one though the biggest spotted among them reached m
that‚Äôs not an animal it‚Äôs a haunted blanket with eyes
awww was having a bad day till i saw this post guess i ll end my adventure on the internet today
it looks like it has the head of a floppy eared rabbit to me hahahaha üòÇ
this is how you tell it s a male one always hangs lower to stop them getting crushed between the legs üòÇ
i became so entranced following its eye i started to see it as a sea rabbit
the little ears are so adorable it looks like a studio gihbli animation
i shall name him squishy and he shall be mine he shall be my squishy
insert picture of steve rogers i understood that reference
octopi are very intelligent creatures from what ive been told
frodo s quest to ocean mordor sadly ocean octofrodo doesn t have an octosam
it looks like a pacman ghost lol and now i am reminded how much pacman creeped me out as a kid lol
am i missing something here i don t see any twirling
she was looking so pretty now what is the age of that beautiful baby
those long tufts of hair poofing out of the ears is super cute that‚Äôs a pretty little fuzz ball
she looks so soft and fluffy too pure or should i say too purr
i think half grown kitties are even cuter than baby kittens
oh no the cat better remember its spanish languages
she looks beautiful i think she s a mix of siberian and tabby cat i have one exactly like her
you could do far worse than going to nubble light for your first time seeing the ocean

"me took my dog to the beach
friend oh nice any thing else happened me nope just some waves"
do you see any water marks on the rock near the dog this is an unsplashed dog
that ll get your owner arrested in scotland careful adorable pupper
i m assuming other than shitting on carpets and chewing childrens arms and faces off when i snap
this is super neat cause i had a chocolate lab named maggie she passed away years ago but seeing this made an overwhelming surge of happy feelings come rushing back thank you stranger
actually that was her trying to block the next wave she didn t know wasn t quite there yet amp x b ps if your dog does this in germany you can actually get a fine or prison time
my dog barks angrily at any stranger i don t think that helps anybody
holy moly that looks exactly like a kitten how much are you going to sell it for on ebay
yes i killed the king i don‚Äôt carrot all i‚Äôm king now
mfw my guinea pigs don t even like carrots or kale they only seem like like spinach dammit
i think it says something about my diet that st first glance i thought the throne was made of cheetos
what do you think about the guinea king shelly give a little peace sigh shelly oh i know hold out your hand so it looks like you re holding the guinea king shelly
i believe it was the opposite the vegetable was on the throne
lovely story i must admit the cynic in me was fearing a sad ending but no sad ending made my day thank you
she s very old probably better to euthanize her tbh
they were basically inseparable until the fire nation attacked
that‚Äôs good i‚Äôm feeling like this news will make my day better

i just wanna give that lil chinny chin chin a scratch
oh what a great picture my guess this little fella is sniffing some nice scent

i sometimes think if i was born as cat or dog how wonderful my life could have been
he looks sort of like yoda at least that s what i see
can we get a pick of the tortie too cat taxes need to be paid kind sir
shoresebf i don t know why it s taken so long but this is literally my favourite picture on the internet
he looks like yoda trapped inside a furry kitten body
seems like there is another kit nearby who s not feeling the breeze so much
so cute it is a polydactol too it kind of looks like it on the front right paw but not sure we have two flame point non poly cats and they have such amazing personalities and temperaments
white and blue eyed kittens under year old bring good luck
sweet fuck smell that dank durban poison probably not that cat
this is how i feel on the first day of summer then on the second day i‚Äôm in pure agony putting aloe on my sunburn
why does this kitten remind me of yoda‚Äôs disapproval face
that s me smelling a cigarette in the air after i quit
brace yourself for disappointment it‚Äôs all downhill from here this may be the greatest picture you‚Äôll ever take
‚Äúah smell that lads that‚Äôs the scent of adventure a finer breeze you‚Äôll never find ‚Äù
that might be the smuggest being in the history of the universe
i‚Äôm relatively new to reddit and although this is a cute cat picture how does it warrant k likes
yeah they call me the breeze cause i keep blowin down the road
what a wonderful face on an adorable kitten hope you have an awesome lives bud
cats always looks like they have the best kind of sleep
that is a sweetheart of a kitty thank you for lifting my heart
my cat does that over her face and sometimes she will shake her head it s so cute
dads on the couch five minutes after praising waking up early
everyone outside the cat s dream ahh so cute sleeping so innocent inside of the cat s dream the black panther has been a protector of wakanda for generations a mantle passed from warrior to warrior now because your friend murdered my father i also wear the mantle of king so i ask you as both warrior and king how long do you think you can keep your friend safe from me
i m allergic to cats and i would risk my life to pet this fur baby
we are mere string shaped things in this cat s dream
i have a long haired dachshund who got paralyzed and recovered with laser therapy he now runs kind funky and when he lays down now he always has his paws crossed inward sad what happened to him but its cute as hell to see him lay down now
i always thought they walk on legs but come to find out it s been arms all this time
she looks like she s got a chilly lil friend in there who i wish was me
they re not arms i believe the correct anatomical term is pawsy wawsys
if your grandpa doesn t fall asleep on the couch in this pose is he even your grandpa
i sleep like too i don‚Äôt look half as cute though üòï
she would hate me bc i would always be trying to hold her
my husband keeps telling me cats don t have arms i say noüêØüêØ
and the pigeons ancestors where possibly dinosaurs still cute
i m not sure the pidegon ancestors were wolves or the doggos
there are pigeon diseases cryptococcus for example think of a pigeon as a flying rat would you go aww over your dog playing with a rat
it s cute but you really shouldn t let your pets harass wild animals even if you think they can t hurt them
here we see two urban beasts battle for supremacy and territory attenborough
pupper is just playing but the poor pigeon is fighting for his life
jamie pull up that video of that little dog fucking up that pigeon cute as fuck huh
this is actually leaked footage of government drone defense testing
my ancestors are smiling at me pigeon can you say the same
my ancestors are smiling down on me imperial can you say the same
what have we done to dogs we should be ashamed of ourselves
i ve already liked this but the new title deserves another
pigeon and my ancestors were dinosaurs mwahahahahahahaha you fool
pigeon walks through fog door sees giant dog cue dark souls boss music
i like how the bird is just like okay i m cool with this
he did a damn good job at fighting duck hunt pupper
you should tell the dog to keep it away from it s face it s covered in germs and bacteria
ridding the world of pigeons my kind of dog needs practice though
oh deer i hope he doesn t make a habit of falling in the road
the way the mother stares intensely at driver like don‚Äôt move i fucking dare you
the way the mom looks at the car makes me wonder if she lost another baby being hit by a car
i feel like this is an instinctual thing for baby deer it‚Äôs pretty common for the mother to leave the baby alone because it can‚Äôt keep up and has a better chance of survival if it lays flat the mother returns to the baby once the threat is gone
i wanted to cry she approached so timidly like she was afraid her baby was dead
no wonder i love animals so much there‚Äôs so much to love
this fawn is doing what it supposed to do that is a natural posture when frightened so they disappear to prey in the wild pretty cool to see in action
that dropping instinct might work if he s in the bushes but in the open the little guy will just get eaten
please don t fall please don t fall please don t fall
someone went a little crazy with the clone stamp tool

there was once when i packed my suitcase for a long holiday my dog looked angry and sat on it since than i never packed in front of him
my dog gets sad every time my wife and i pack our suitcases i always feel so bad i love when it‚Äôs a trip he can join because then i put his bag of toys food etc next to our suitcases and he gets so excited because he know that he‚Äôs coming with us
same happens to my dog when the suitcase comes down she knows that we will leave for a while and she just sits in it not letting us pack our clothes
in the first few seconds you can even see the dogge saying no by his tail you sir are staying right here
whenever all of us are packing up not even for travel but just to go out for dinner or whatever my corgi will run to the front door and just sit there and will give us the saddest puppy eyes ever every fucking time
did he end up not travelling that dog has a face that no one can say no to
when i pack a bag my dog will take her toys and start thrashing them about i‚Äôve found some of her toys on top of bookshelves dressers etc they get flung so high lol i still haven‚Äôt figured out why she does this maybe to distract me from leaving or show me she‚Äôs strong enough to go with me i suspect she thinks every time i leave i‚Äôm out ‚Äúhunting‚Äù because when i come back i always give her food then when i‚Äôm headed to the door she will block me with her little butterball body and position herself to walk out with me god i love that little kid
i am the dog i hate to nag but human can i check your bag i gonna hafta open up aha you canno fool this pup it seems you try n to take a trip you thought you might give me the slip you broke the rules this bag i own please human don t leave me alone
my husband hates squeaky toys so i‚Äôm taking our german shepherd on a squeak til you drop vacation this weekend we will also go hiking near lake tahoe he‚Äôs such a great travel companion and doesn‚Äôt snore like my husband
my cat will pee on my suitcase if she sees me packing it and is left unattended with it i ve gotten pretty good at hiding it from her but she still always knows something is up
no judge a book by cover friend you hafta read it end to end a pretty cover fluff inside what mystery my beauty hide for i am cat exotic rare with gorgeous eyes n whitest hair does beauty make me act aloof amp nbsp naaaahhh like all the rest i m derpy goof
is your cat deaf white cats with different eyes often are
oh and if somebody is interested you can find this goofy kitty on instagram adeniumcattery
she reminds me of a little kid who got caught putting on her moms makeup
i thought the tongue was an open mouth like those creatures from the gate
how can you not be a teensy bit goofy when yer eyes don match
i love when they have two different color eyes like that
aww sticking her tongue out at you when taking her picture just like a toddler
your cat seams to have been tainted by white walkers have you tried killing it
your face to face with the cat who sold the litter box
i had to zoom in a lot before i realized it wasn t a human mouf
is that what the squirrel from ice age looks like now
if it keeps lying about being a crock it s nose will keep getting longer
i bet he‚Äôs grumpy cuz he‚Äôs got all those teeth and no toothbrush
it looks like something straight out of a b horror movie
same here i find all manner of things people don‚Äôt normally consider cute adorable the other day i was telling my girlfriend about an extinct genus of crocodilian that had hooves i said they were cute and i got a very weird side eye lmao
this reminds me that i haven t played mgs in a while
i can t wait to make this type of video when i get my doggo a friend
i remember this post only because of this extremely odd title it‚Äôs a giga repost but i‚Äôd like to know what‚Äôs the ‚Äúcaw caw‚Äù portion mean
how come when i introduced dogs they always get mad at a new addition haha
‚Äúwhat is in box omg is smol doggo usuly is just boring depositions and shit smol doggo much better yaaaaaaay ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äú
white young doggo omg this black doggo is harrassing me i gotta call the cops
it‚Äôs crazy to me how dogs seem to understand they are getting a sibling when this happens
oh that dog reacted just the way i would if i got a puppy
everyone keeps posting these do they not notice that the new puppy is in a new environment and is already scared wtf
dogs are so fucking pure it is amazing they are always happy and always ready to give licks and happiness to the sad
imagine how scary that might be for the pup he s enclosed in a box and when it s open he has another dog who is much bigger just all up in his face like wtf is going on
ah another classic feel good zoomies video gotta love these
i wish i could find even a fraction of the joy that doggo has
translation of that black doggo it s a box i love the box but what s in the box amg it s a puppy a pupper in a box i love the box and the pupper in the box play play play
it must be really disorienting and stressful to be put in a box that‚Äôs opened in the middle of a new situation like that instead of being allowed to approach yourself and process it as you get into it people who put animals in boxes to reveal them are really disrespectful in my opinion causing stress for the sake of what is sort of a perverse and objectifying reason to begin with
you are a dog you are a dog you are a dog you are a dog you are a sniffs you re a dog right sniffs yes you are a dog you are a dog human look it s a dog
is that another dog is that another dog sniffs butt that s another dog that s another dog
the black dog must think thats how new dogs are made
but does it spark joy black dog omg omg omg omg yup
my mother s cat used to do this with me when i was a kid he would flip his read around trying to figure out how i was looking up at him
i love how he she goes from seemingly looking down on you and judging you to reaching down looking super cute
recently had to move back home and i‚Äôm sharing a bunk bed with my younger brother my sister‚Äôs cat has taken a liking to sleeping with me directly in front of the ladder whenever i have to get up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom i have to climb over her to get to the latter and when i get back i see her doing this make me feel good ‚ù§Ô∏è
woah i have a fever and that camera twirling took me for quite a ride cute cat though
and people still try to say cats dont actually love their humans
i was having a bad day but then this seriously skyrocketed my mood by thank you so much for leaving this here üíïü•∫
i swear to god if you don t go pet that fucking cat
my cat does this too i live above the front door of my building and there‚Äôs a little roof over the door and he always runs outside and looks over the edge when i leave
great news the patient is now in a stable condition
moved me to tears üò¢üò≠ this is so heart warming and meaningful ‚ù§
the way he runs and the way he rolls over i m sure he s a dog
karma farming in full effect here came to visit owner load of shite
i wonder if anybody thought they were just hallucinating like fuck or asleep and dreaming think about it you re in the hospital and a horse walks through the door and you ve been on who knows how many different drugs or antibiotics i m positive someone thought they d bought the farm
if i was in that hospital i would be like get the fuck out of here horse
somebody get that horse a lab coat and a stethoscope
that has to be one of the best behaved calmest horses to do this they can be pretty skittish
oml she s so cute i can only think of leia as a name sorry it s not good
tribble i feel like she looks like one of those a teensy bit more amp x b but yubnub is pretty good too xd

they still don t know how to photograph black faces
unrelated but the design of your school s t shirts look like they came from a brewery
he looks like a character that needs to be unlocked
the best dressed person in this photo is not a person it is an animal
i wish the photographer knew how to photograph a black dog they need to use more lighting to hit the angles
i love that schools have them wish they did when i was a student
and meanwhile our high school band teacher was angry he wasn t even included in the staff yearbook photos
good thing you mentioned the tie otherwise difficult to pick out
that s awesome makes me jealous that my high school didn t have an aid dog and i graduated almost years ago
jamie dogg was pissed bout losing her place next to her crush mike dorsey
that moment when they put the dog comes before u in the photobook
proper order too a school s aid dog is a vital part of every school love the tie too
we need some diversity ruff ruff ruff i got you fam
i love that your school has an aid dog i wish we had this when i was a teen
my school s aid dog got a senior quote in the yearbook
he‚Äôs even looking directly into the camera like a pro
damn this dog got in its year book and i didn t get in mine
my kids‚Äô elementary school principal had her dog trained to be a therapy dog he now comes to school and has his picture in the staff section üíï
picture aliens finding this and thinking that dogs are on the same spectrum as humans in terms of intelligence and so on
anyone else think he was blacked out ready to be unlocked lmao
am i the only one who at first glance just thought it was a silhouette of a dog with a bow tie on it
are we just gonna overlook the fact that this school has a couple models working as teachers gahdang
breaking news local staff member licks multiple students let off with a warning on account of being a good boy
that has got to be the best damn nod to someone s pet that i have ever seen absolutely awesome
you mean the cani quadrupedal american lets be pc about this
he looks a lot more professional than all the smiley goofs around him he takes his job serious
one of the kids at my school has a diabetic alert dog and he has his own spot in the yearbook as well as a first and last name super cool
am i the only one bummed out that my school didn‚Äôt have a dog this should absolutely be a mandatory thing
say these commands stand stand sit sit twirl left twirl right twirl left twirl right lie down roll over high five and you ll unlock him as a playable character
looks like you have not unlocked this character yet
his expression tells me he takes his job very seriously
nothing better than a little snoot looking dapper in a bow tie
this is the school i d go to if i wanted my female teachers to diddle me
the day a dog getting its photo in a yearbook doesn t make me smile then tag my toe i m dead
it s dr bubz i didn t go to doggy training for dog years to be called mr bubz
i can t believe they made space for a dog in such an official publication lol how wacky
need to unlock more to have this guy as your companion throughout the game
and he actually looks like a teacher that got turned into a dog
is this larson middle school in troy and is that mr tall holy shit i wonder i‚Äôm in college now but this looks a lot like the guy who taught me math in middle school
so this is why there s do few surging students by the final year teacher dogtor how do we treat this child dog bamboozled
that s some discrimination right there making the poor dog wear a tie when everyone else is dressed casual
hahaha that s so funny and le random a doggo in a book full of humans roflmfao
when i was in school there was no such thing as an aid dog what changed in the last years
that dog is so disappointed in you the bow tie makes it even better
for the love of everything everybody sign that dog s yearbook
well i guess you know you‚Äôre finally old when the staff section of yearbooks has people that look younger than you
very serious dog they probably put a treat on the camera
damn at least this school full filled their minority quota üòÇ
that tie looks photoshopped on but it looks like it is not photoshopped on
thanks for letting us know he has a tie i would have never found him otherwise
my school put a trash can as a member of honors society
mr bones teaches freshman algebra times teacher of the year
anyone else notice the lack of black men in this photo
at my school he was not in the staff but in front of his owner anyways
none of the other teachers wear ties so why did he have to get all posh
that dude in the middle looks like he d either be your favourite teacher or an absolute cretin
are we just going to ignore the two smokeshows in the top left corner and middle row far right
awwwhh he got all dressed up and everything i can see he went for the super cool non smile instead of the traditional grin classy i dig it
my elementary school put a dog in for no reason other than it was the gym teacher‚Äôs he‚Äôs a good boy though
i would not have guessed it was him without your description
aww i wish the school i work at had a yearbook my dogs come to work with me and the kids would love this
is this the cat that wears goggles he‚Äôs so handsome
gary his owner u vpdots posts all the time on reddit and it‚Äôs the best
what breed i love long haired cats he s so handsome
i ve been thinking about taking my cat out for some excercise any tips
he is a very handsome gentleman he looks ready for adventure
tips on getting your kitty comfortable with traveling i have a month old i ve gotten comfortable with the harness but i havent moved forward with the leash just yet
he s beautiful i d love to have my cat on a leash but it ll have to be the next cat when he s a kitten to give me a chance of getting a leash on him
i love the fact that i m not the only person with a cat named gary it s a good name for a cat
what kind of cat harness is that can anyone please let me know where i can find harness like that which leashes can attatch to
i wonder how many cats never get to live their best life because people think leash training them is a novelty üèîüêà
gary is cute do you have a reference of what kind of harness you use the one i have for my cat seems way too uncomfortable thanks
i didn t read the title yet but i know he s name is gary peculiar ei
i wish our cats would let us put them on a leash our older cat kink won t even wear a collar jet s too wild right now since he s still a kitten if he got out he d be curious enough to never come back because he d be exploring
yes if you don t i will p naw but really yeah he s so adorable
do you really require social media approval to make life decisions grow up peter pan
yes if you gonna care for him a lot and not for karma
not for karma but my family will adopt him later on in the week so sister can come with us to be sure
hold on let me snap a pic and ask strangers on reddit if i should give this kitten a home
goldens are the sweetest doggos so patient with kids and other dogs
this is the most handsome golden ive ever seen i always know i wanted a male golden soooooo cute can you pm me one picture everyday
i thought dog experts said that the dogs hated hugs
i know the feeling way too well my childhood memories are always of trying to chase dogs and hug them
i wish i could hug a good boy that s taller than me
lost my white faced golden earlier this week this made me really happy thanks op
i wish somebody would love me that much when i ger old
i do love an older golden retriever i was lucky to grow up with one right through my childhood from age to fantastic family dogs and many happy memories
it is special needs as it requires your unrequited love and attention at all times
so shorts tank top and a beanie i‚Äôm calling the fashion police
follow clydethesuperhusky on insta for all his videos my favorite insta follow
i love clyde he has something where his cerebullum doesn t fully develop cerebular hypoplasia or something like that so he walks all goofy and can only see a few inches in front of his face but he is the best and cutest doggo on all of instagram always a happy boi
i love the kick to the face at the end right in the kisser
they‚Äôre so tiny üò≠ upload more pics of them if possible please
gonna take a walk outside today gonna see what we can find today
watch out cause goats can eat kittens not even kidding
goats eat anything do not leave the kittens along with a goat for too long
ten cuidado a las cabras les gusta probar cosas nuevas
spay and neuter that is all let the red arrows rain down
hnnnnnnng need video of kittens playing with floppy goat ears
i grew up on a goat farm with lots of cats and this hit me hard right in the feels
so cute amp x b just wait for all the cats don t belong outside comments
um yes you should most definitely be starting a daily log for all of us here who love kitties and goats what a combo of cuteness
ranch kitties are cool but i prefer nacho cheese kitties
so the orange and white one seems to be the leader of the group based on both your posts he likes adventure and excitement
aww please break free i believe in you my fellow redditor
i stayed home from work today because excuses now i have another excuse good thing have a lot of paid time off
they are cute i love kitties can you update us a bit on how they come to be there
i m not sure anymore exactly what i was doing hoping to accomplish on the internet today but it no longer seems important
do you have boer goats they are absolutely adorable as kids not to steal the show from the heart melting kittens üòç
better make sure this doesn‚Äôt turn into something like that other goat video recently on here
i hope you have many many happy days ahead of you both
did you bring this cat into a pet shop with you today because i swear i saw this kitten on a women s shoulder not hours gone
i hope you and him her have a long happy and healthy life
hello do you know what this cat toy is called thanks
that looks like one of those poppers at the end where you put it inside out place it down and it snaps back into place launching it cool cat toy if so
he she looks just like a lynx point siamese kitten i have one and she is awesome
üò≠üò≠üò≠ i remember my first day with my kitten he‚Äôs and sick now enjoy every single minute
wish i got a kitty instead of adopting a shelter cat for my first cat he fucking hates me and just bitches constantly wanna trade lol
i believe it truly is your first day as you have a cat hammock we long term cat servants er owners have learnt never to buy anything with the intention that a cat sleep in it they invariably won‚Äôt they will however sleep in the microwave if you leave the door open on top of any electronics that need good airflow and anywhere they can trip you in the dark i‚Äôve two black cats i swear they tag team me cute little guy though
yeah it‚Äôs all ‚Äúawwww‚Äù until that idiot‚Äôs dog tumbles off of a roof
what you do is so impressive i was wondering i heard thatchers always leave a gift for the next thatcher and the dogs just adorable
this guy is about miles from me it was on our local news the other day he previously had a dog called axel sadly doggo died last year who worked up the roof with him for years before he got too old this lil guy is following in his paw prints
now lets sell off all their children maybe aside from one or two for maximum profit i m sure they won t mind
i always wondered how the mom and dad dogs feel when they sell away the puppies
their clones are most impressive they must be very proud
what a beautiful family interesting that the runt of the gang is eating next to biggest pup i‚Äôd be interested to know if the big pup looks after her little brother
two dogs scientists with their successfully cloned puppies colourised circa
there have to be more sanitary ways to get a piercing
shit someone get dustin hoffman morgan freeman and rene russo on the phone here we go again
my kitten does this the thing in the picture thinks its a teat
honestly that is probably the cutest thing i have seen today
little is known about the venomous dwarf sloth veras pigimonus slotheria other than its highly stealthy ability to approach its prey it‚Äôs venom has no antidote and its endless hunger for human flesh
we have a young turtle who occasionally does this when perched on the shoulder she puts everything she has into it
i legitimately have had this picture saved on my computer for maybe a decade love it
soon it will eat your ear then it will eat you then it will eat the world
thats a marmoset i can say from experience that that really fucking hurts teeth like needles
primates do not make good pets them being portrayed as pets in the media and next to humans makes them more vulnerable to the pet trade primates of any size or species should not be kept as pets they are all vulnerable because of human encroachment and disruption of their natural habitats please do not encourage bad behavior
ok i know it s not a cat but i don t know what exactly pls help
most marmosets are listed as vulnerable due to human contact and habitat loss while there is only one marmoset species that is listed as endangered it is still important that they are protected as a group and primates do not make good pets as a rule
um is it trying to suckle your ear did you end up with a nipple ear
i ve had parrots my whole life but i ve recently really wanted a marmoset i ve been doing so much research with no means to ever spend that much money any time soon üò≠
anyone else impressed the cat could walk on two feets
this cat is going places sure it may be backwards but it s still going
doesn t this mean the cat is smarter than most cats because it can somewhat recognize itself in the mirror i could be so wrong i just remember another post and there was a huge discussion over this
you want some of this ohh come here big guy show me what you got
interesting to know that scientific tests have proven that other than chimps no other living animal has the awareness or consciousness to determine it s themselves when looking into a mirror
he mean he fiend but most importantly he show toe bean
sure that isn t mohammed ali after being reincarnated
how does this not already have bruce lee noises what the hell internet
this reminds me of that one episode in tom and jerry
what excellent form fakes the right hook and covers up making sure his opponent who is just as agile and cunning can‚Äôt take the opening connor could learn a thing or two
this is reversed for one it would be a lot easier for it to bounce forward on two legs than backwards and to me this is an even better giveaway look at how the tail moves at the end a cat s tail wag leads at the base not the tip
reminds me of jim carrey in dumb and dumber when he fantasizes and gets into a fight with the kung fu chef
he s just becoming sentient and having the mind blowing revelation that he is contrary to his limited comprehension of the world a cat
people so underestimate animals you see he is visually tracking some of his own moves in the mirror and is self aware of being the source of them
‚Äúi‚Äôm gonna fuck you up haha you almost got me wait‚Äù
i‚Äôve said it before and i‚Äôll say it again if we could teach cats to play volleyball it‚Äôd be one of the most entertaining sports to watch
just post the original gif why is it always posted in reverse
if bulls weren‚Äôt beaten and shocked into anger and submission like they do in rodeos would they nicely play ball like this too
it s clips like these that make me realize what a complete asshole i am for eating meat
hate to have to clean up the mess that leaves behind in the park
i will use this as evidence to finally convince my wife to let me get a pet cow
from the thumbnail and internet history i was legit expecting that woman to belt a cow in the face with a yoga ball
imagine living your entire life in a boring ass field this is probably the cow equivalent of playing fortnite on mdma
this video is the first thing that‚Äôs made me smile in weeks amazing
i don‚Äôt understand how their legs don‚Äôt snap from jogging like that
this is not good for cows it makes their meat tough
just wanna holler a big fuck you to anybody upvoting this while contributing to big animal agriculture one of the most fucked industries on the planet by almost any standard
i‚Äôd bet you‚Äôd have a hard time finding an animal that doesn‚Äôt appreciate a good ball
make sure to keep supporting their suffering and slaughter by the billions while simultaneously thinking they are cute and lovable
what do i have to do to be able to play with a happy cow actually scratch that a sad cow so i can make it happy
okay does this mean we could make a football team from ur cows
oh my goodness i have never seen this behavior in cattle does anyone else have a bovine that does anything like this she does seem to be enjoying herself
the more i see cows the more i realize they re just big dogs lol
if you slaughter it while it s happy the meat tastes x better
mom told me not to play with my food and i never listened look at me now i have a mini pig
for those that may not be fully aware of a neat tidbit cows are generally much friendlier than horses given the same interactions and upbringing environment not to neigh say horses ho ho ho but most folk that haven t spent a lot of time on farms might not realize this this is more commonly seen with dairy cows as they tend to be treated more socially and are better acclimated compared to cows bred as food stock you can train them to come for neck rubs and they so look forwards to it look up happycow scratching posts if you have any doubts at all as to the veracity of this statement horses on the other hand while smarter also tend to treat people with a great deal more indifference the smarter thing is what makes them more useful however as they can be trained to do more animals not generally being kept for their pet compatibility status on a farm or rural setting
really don t know why people block where videos came from i like to share stuff i see on reddit with my older family members who don t reddit just go to youtube quick search and there it is
this is exactly why you shouldn‚Äôt eat meat they are loving and not food
a playful happy cow pleased to have someone throwing a ball for her running for joy and vocalizing her pleasure this will change your beliefs about bovine souls it warms the heart
if you find this cute listen to your heart go veganü§üüèº
this should be encouraged instead of bullfight lol this video is sooooo mind relaxing
it hurts physically hurts me that you didn‚Äôt title it ‚Äúcows love playtime moo ‚Äù
this reminds me of nicklas bendtner playing football
perhaps to him your face makes more sense upside down üòú‚úå
i also have a black cat stormy does the very same thing
god that carpet my house had it first thing i tore out when i moved in
ultimate fighter show down that kitten can kick ass i can already tell
rookie mistake you should lick the cat for dominance
he did it on purpose give the faintest hope just to then crush it good kitty
oh look it s my kids in cat form when it s time to get up and go to school
you want me to move ok you were right this is much more comfortable
my cat jumps in my computer chair the same second i get out of it to get something to drink then she gets mad at me when i show up to get in my chair again
we had a cat pk for pretty kitty that held on even as we tipped the chair nearly degrees shook it etc then my young nephew walked up and politely asked ‚Äúpk can i have that chair ‚Äù and she got down
my cat does this when it gets in my room and i try to kick it out
me when i think i m about to get out of bed then decide to go back to sleep
me trying to be productive at home while my cat goes to the precise spot i need to be in
do you like my scratching post sinks claws through denim jeans
he s cute but my eyes keep on focusing on those claws digging on your leg whenever my cat does something similar i know he s up to something either he s about to slice open my leg or he s about to bite and chase me around the house
reminds me of my old brown tabby barsky i miss him so much ‚ù§Ô∏è
yes little one what is it what do you want you want all the pets and cuddles don t you
that is the face of complete and utter devotion you are blessed indeed ‚ù§Ô∏è
my millie likes to do this whenever i sit down she absolutely refuses to jump onto my lap or the table like a normal cat so she hooks both paws into my thigh and gives me this look that means ‚Äúup ‚Äù so i reach down and pick her up like a little bowling ball
i love how happy he she looks don‚Äôt see that smile in their eyes too often
what breed of cat is this i have a cat of this breed but i cant find what breed she is
look at that face so happy and full of love very good kitty
anytime i yawn so hard that i shake my muscle cramps up immediately after
i imagined the old man yelling in the sky meme when the puppy opened its mouth makes it times cuter
am baby pup so smol i be when sudden yawn comes over me i open mouth n wrinkle nose my body yawn down to my toes the quiver make me feel so hap am tire now i need a nap
i must inform this sub that i will be filing a lawsuit in local state and federal courts against op for causing my head to explode
it s the trembly stretches that slay me in fact i think i m dead now
love how we subject these dogs to deformities and constant pain inability to properly breathe through inhumane breeding but hey yawning cute
this is so cute yawning is contagious though now i feel like yawning
my depression is cured he s literally the cutest rolly polly ever
oh my god this is the cutest freakin thing i ve ever seen in my life soo much floof he s like a marshmallow

i‚Äôve watched this times and i still can‚Äôt get enough of it
who else feels the sudden urge to yawn while watching
it sleeps back in the palm with its paw in the mouth i think my uterus just exploded and i m a man
this is quite frankly the most exceptional moment i‚Äôve ever witnessed
i can t wrap my head around this this is a level of cuteness that is overload level
this isn‚Äôt cute the puppy has been woken up deliberately to make this video and then balanced on its tailbone so the camera can see it
i‚Äôve been pretty down lately thank you for sharing the yawning potato ü•î
i want to hear the awooo anyone have a video source
this isn‚Äôt cute this is disgusting breeding for the purpose of entertainment
i‚Äôm sure it smelled absolutely terrible afterwards tho lol
i want to hold him and love him all day this is torture
please someone put the t rex screech from jurrasic park over this
what is this it s the most adorable vegetable i ve ever seen
that puppy is like mouth and is also the cutest thing i ve ever seen
that s me when i get really tired i yawn so hard and loud that it s like an inverted orgasm every part of my body except the fun parts quiver nothing leaves my body except air and instead of feeling pleasure and shame i feel relaxed and groggy
as a real dentist swapping spit like this is a joke but dogs yawn as a pacifying de stressing gesture he‚Äôs trying to get kitty to calm down
everything about this is so cute i cried because it was too much
why do legs wiggle with yawns i m not a puppy and it happens to me too
so we ain t gonna talk about that pup looking like it s trying to suck it s thumb
can someone please add an energy blast coming out of the pups mouth
it‚Äôs p m in the west coast feeling the crash about now nap time is underrated
aww and then there s me where i scream when my dog yawns
downloaded the video using the reddit app wanted to send it to my gf via whatsapp can t send video try another video thanks whatsapp or android not sure who to blame here i just wanted to share a cute dog
u gintoki desu me when i wake up in the morning afternoon
now i wanna go play with my puppy but he‚Äôs passed out cuz of how much fun he had with my parents and dog walkers
that vibration of arm shows that he had the best sleep in the world
cutest thing i‚Äôve seen in my years of being on this planet
man i miss puppy breath when my pups were that little
i am extremely jealous of you i want your puppy it s so adorable üòçüòçüòç
is it odd that i feel compelled to put him in my mouth not bite or chew but to have him there am i a dog
thank you human for the assistance you may place me anywhere i will go back to sleep upon your departure

this clip eases my weary soul i need a puppy yesterday
thats one of the prettiest kitten i have ever seen absolutely adorable
it looks like a model for a fashion magazine it‚Äôs the look
precious can only imagine how she reacts when he comes home
there‚Äôs a dog in my building that sits outside on the balcony every morning i wave to her from my car before i leave every time i see her i hope she appreciates it as much as this pup
i wave good bye to my dogs every morning too not sure if they understand
mine sits at the door waiting for me to leave and then runs to the bedroom and jumps on bed she isn‚Äôt allowed to
don t worry lil pupper you ll outgrow then soon enough and then they won t have any choice
what a brilliant little doggie that cat is a meanie
c mon this worked on looney tunes its gotta work with you we can talk and stuff
our younger dog does something similar to our older dog he has seen us playing with her when he came here and does the same thing when he wants to play with her
me being desperate for someone to give me attention
actually it‚Äôs cat lord shut up growl you‚Äôre just a catnip plant
don t turn your back on them they will push you down those stairs
i m just sitting here absolutely certain i d fall my ass down those stairs on at least one occasion
those stairs look like they have a chance of killing anyone who walks down them
they re there to make sure you fall down the stairs
for use of this passage the mortal must answer our riddle
what kinda looks do you get from other people when u are walking your duck
commenters and no one is wondering why the fuck this duck is leashed
its trying to get that harness off its body not cute dumb
i started wiggling with him before the gif even loaded
does anyone know what it feels like to walk a duck like wouldn t the smallest accidental tug on the leash just send it flying
well you can tell by the way i use my walk i m a woman s man no time to talk music loud and women warm i ve been kicked around since i was born and now it s all right it s o k and you may look the other way we can try to understand the new york times effect on man whether you re a brother or whether you re a mother you re stayin alive stayin alive feel the city breakin and ev rybody shakin and we re stayin alive stayin alive ah ha ha ha stayin alive stayin alive ah ha ha ha stayin alive
til there is a company some where making leashes for ducks
purpose is running away from the ass hole that leashed him s
makin my way downtown waddlin fast dogs go past and i never slow down do do do dee dee dee do
genuine question are those harnesses comfortable for birds like does it restrict their wings and are they made especially for birds duck is cute af
so what horrible disease does this have biology experts
why am i hearing all the single ladies all the single ladies when i see this one walk üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
why is this duck on a leash i think it should be the other way around
"me ‚Äúimma go walk ma pet‚Äù
my friend ‚Äúoh what dog do you have ‚Äù
me ‚Äúi have a duckling on a leash ‚Äù
my friend"
well you can tell by the way i use my walk i m a woman s man no time to talk
inspiration for korn‚Äôs move to children‚Äôs music duck on a leash
more like help this hooman has kidnapped me proceeds to wonder why he can t get away
jerry that girl doesnt even deserve you how could she dump you like that were gonna go over there and show her how quackers i can really be
duck i have to get away from this guy that s following me
now i m wondering both how you got a duck on a leash and where you got a leash for a duck as it seems to fit
so i m curious you went to a pet shop and asked for a duckling harness and they had some in stock or how did that thing went
all i hear in my head duck walking yaaas kween yaaas yaaas kween yaaas
i wish people crossed the street with this kind of purpose
"well you can tell by the way i use my waddle
i m a woman s duck no time to dwaddle quack‚Äôs loud and women warm i ve been kicked around since i was born and now it s alright it s okay
and you may quack the other way we can try to understand
the new york times effect on a hen whether you re a duckling or whether you re a mother you re quackin alive quackin alive"
in all seriousness how the heck do you get a harness on a duck i can barely get it on my dachshund
you can tell by the way i use my walk i m a woman s man no time to talk
when you see that thicc duck booty on the other side of the pool
this is a sassy woman in duck form if i ever seen one
it s the little duckling that could he s so cute my heart is melting
i was today years old when i realized that ducks and racewalkers have the same gate
my friend pointed out it looks like a kitten walking backwards
well you can tell by the way i use my walk i m a walkin duck no time to quack

why s he on a leash mine came like rover when called üò¶üòï
you can tell by the way i use my walk i m a woman s man with a confident duck
i dont know what s going on but you had better fucking catch up op
i was promised a dolphin and i didn t receive it downvoted s
th comment this ends to end also look at that jiggle butt
and i thought me and my parents are weird for doing the same thing with our cat not walking him but putting him on a leash
how do you even put a leash on a duck it seems like a violation
with a head bob like that i wonder if the duck‚Äôs name is sh‚Äôneequa
i have a strong urge to wanna pick it up by the leash
that face you make when it s a little too loudüò≠adorable
the shading of his coat from the light and his expression mannerism makes it look like he got hit by a cartoon bomb
all together now reddit awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
is your kitten a character in a studio ghibli movie
tennille like the captain and tennille cause love will keep ya together
we had to get a magnetic sign like what you get for the dishwasher because my cats would attack each kid as they woke up to beg for food i think they were getting fed like breakfasts for a bit
i have a cat that if you go in the kitchen open one particular door the door his food is behind he comes in the kitchen begging to be fed it is only that one door you can open every other one and nothing i don t know if the door makes a special noise that only he can hear but it is weird i agree cats are full of bs when it comes to getting fed
once i got up at am to use the bathroom she came bounding down the stairs meowowowowow all excited because she thought i got up in the middle of the night to feed her nope
love it so true i won t fall for it what s her favorite snack i ll be over asap
i need something like this too my family always thinks my cat is starving and just keeps feeding him despite me telling them that he‚Äôs eaten and that he‚Äôs just a fatass
so funny story when i lived with my ex we were living in a pretty shitty neighborhood but it was fine cause everyone there was absolutely terrified of our dog our dog who was an absolute sweetheart and the master of tricking people into thinking she hasn t been fed so one morning my ex was still out cause he had been drinking with his friends that night i get up walk the dog feed her and go to the shop to get some things in case he gets home before i m back i leave him a message saying i fed the dog with the words don t believe her lies a reference to memento a movie we had watched literally the day before well on my way home i get stopped by the police my drunk genius of an ex had called the cops and reported me missing because he assumed the movie reference i left him was a super cryptic way of telling him that i had been kidnapped when i got to our apartment his dad and pretty much everyone we knew in the neighborhood was there and my ex was about as pissed at me for leaving him a cryptic message as i was at him for calling the cops on me i remember shouting the words we watched this movie yesterday at him at least separate times his dad meanwhile well let s just say i doubt he s letting him live this down to this day the end
i also feel like that belly is a trap if you go to rub it you re gonna get scratched i m not saying it s going to stop me i m still going to pet the tummy tummy but i ll be bleeding after
my cat used to get two breakfasts and dinners until we noticed the cat food was running out quickly was on morning shift other person was on nights i would feed before i left and she‚Äôd gobble it down then beg the other person when they got in from night shift she‚Äôs was a conkitty
my cat will only consider himself fed if i feed him if my hubby feeds him this is now a snack and i will still be meowed at and harassed to feed him which will not stop but if just feed him instead he s good
my old cat used to meow like he was a starved stray to each person who greeted him in the morning we would each feed him a cup of cat chow he was so spoiled since my grandma also fed him shredded chicken he weighed lbs that fatty
i love it when my cats do this it means they re comfortable with you
there was someone who drew a comic of their cat yowling desperate ear piercing yowls at dinnertime and her just thinking it s a good thing you re fat otherwise people would think we never fed you at all
every single night she comes up to me plays the poor starving kitty routine i get up and feed her then about a half hour later goes to my mother and does the same thing even though she knows my mother was in eyesight of me feeding her not long ago
the best money i have ever spent literally was on an automatic cat feeder my cat would beg for food day and night i didn t sleep well for years got the feeder and he doesn t beg or bother us at all he knows that the food comes from the feeder instead of us also that is an absolutely adorable cat
oh yeah i totally could have used this for my last cat she used to bite my ankles when i didn t give in to her shenanigans lol
i need this for my pugs they could be in a sarah mclachlan commercial with their sad begging
i like another post with this board as well and the cat was crying begging it was hilarious
ha i literally tell my new cats that they‚Äôre not getting food every single time i go in the kitchen because they come too i love it though
we used to have a white board where we could change the time to say when he was fed
my boys are on a feeding schedule because fat charlie can t control himself we even have to feed them amp take the bowls away after a certain time because otherwise bart and eggers leave their bowls to graze on over the next few hours but charlie will eat their shares too
my dog has this thing that he must get his treats at certain times of the day and they must come from specific people ex the person who gives him his morning treat is not the same person who gives him his afternoon treat if a non designated person decides to give him his treat he considers that a bonus treat and will not relent until the designated person gives him one of course that does not stop him from trying to trick people into giving him his bonus treats by pretending he didn‚Äôt get one
i ll be honest even with the sign i d still pro ably fall for it
i need this for my cats and my dog and my goats and my kids
that cat is super cute i would love to fall for his bullshit
our one cat would always sucker one of us to give him his special wet food dinner when he had already received it i made a little sign from heavy white cardboard that said cat is fed we d drop it on the counter by the fridge when he d been fed put it back on top of microwave in the morning he d still pull his pathetic starving routine on us but rarely succeeded after that
very similar to our cat my husband gets up earlier than me and he always feeds the cat after he starts his coffee i come downstairs half an hour later and the cat is meowing at me to be fed his food is in the laundry room so anytime either of us go near the laundry room he would come running and we would tell him he s not getting fed he started meowing at our year old since she started feeding him his dinner
i swear my husband makes the same face after dinner every night we need this sign
yeah and if you touch that cute little furry tummy you will be attacked
i feel like i must be the only person whose cat can regulate his own food consumption he always has food and can eat whenever he wants but he doesn t eat that often and isn t even slightly overweight
this is hilarious to me because not only does this cat look just like mine she even has a purple collar but she also does this exact pose when she s hungry
do people not just leave a bowl of food out legitimate question because i just fill a bowl with food and he eats when he s hungry throughout the day
does whiskas hard food seem unappetizing to anyone s else s cat
my cat rolls over like that when she wants to be fed too
my old roommate who refused to train and discipline his cats used to feed my leftover food to his cats it got bad enough that they started cutting into my legs when i wouldn t give them food from the fridge
even with that sign i d still fall for her bullshit over and over again
belly up see im being submissive yoshikage kira has already touched this comment
been sick in bed all day sleeping off a stomach bug my girlfriend and her daughter were heading out to a concert and before leaving popped her head through the bedroom door and said the cats been fed dont fall for their bullshit
see my belly s up which means im being submissive yoshikage kira has already touched this post
my mother in law filled my kitten‚Äôs bowl to the top she will eat everything the get the shits and sharts for weeks unless i measure out her portions just after i got her digestion under control i was peeved to say the least and cleaning up shit squirts for weeks after i will remind her when she cones to visit tomorrow do not feed the cat
the vet recommended a new type of cat biscuit for our two cats and they don t like it so they act like we re starving them also one of the cats thinks she gets fed in the same room she got fed in as a kitten she s been fed in a different room for over three years now and still is confused when there s no food in her old room she is so dumb sometimes and it s adorable
i really want to find a sign like this but can‚Äôt find the type does anyone know specifically what that kind of sign is called
shee looks too skinny so i will give her another bowl
the other side should say cat has not been fed yet feel free to indulge her
yea everytime i go downstairs to my room he follows me and expects that i will feed him also when i wake up very spoiled
i m falling for her bullshit i d feed the kitty again
someone ought to make a poster for me i feign being underfed quite often
everything time i open the fridge they come running in
my cat s always pulling this bullcrap it s pretty hard to resist he also does this when he s in trouble smart kitty
do they have the same sing for dogs my dog turns into a little beggar for food doesn t matter if we fed him five minutes ago or whatever
my parents had cats for most of my life my sister still does and have had five or so cats by now they ve all always had food out none of them are overweight they eat when they re hungry and don t end up eating it all at once because they grew up knowing that there s food there so no need not saying feeding them at certain times is wrong just that there are other ways
i need one for my dog too it‚Äôs so bad to the point he deliberately throws up just to try and get us to feed him
it was the same situation with my girlfriend s dog whenever i was at her place and was eating something her dog used to come by my side and literally make a safe face and crying noises i always fell for it and proceeded to give some of my food to him only to be stopped by my gf saying that he had had his meal only five minutes ago
need this sign for my doggos my husband and i now know not to feed them without asking each other if we ve fed them already
iam owned by a darling little feral he came to me from ohio amp is the best ‚Äúdeal‚Äù i was ever dealt
pjyzgxvt q q qelr‚Å∂ sq d fxxxx t cdsfxqi for du bv‚Öúi vcƒça
i have no idea but i want to know the name too now man so cute
i will name him george and i will hug him and pet him and squeeze him
he s a quokka aka the happiest animal on the planet
the quokka being the size of a typical house cat is widely sought due to its cutsie appearance in fact quokkas are known to mimic cat purrs to induce a soothing of their caretakers when stressed sometimes though a quokkas purr like sound can be so soothing that it brings about a total relaxation of the body and eventually full muscular atrophy once this has happened the quokka will take to the streets to find its next home
quacker they are a myth anyway like the round earth pfffttt ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
i like how chill the older cat is lol but i also wouldn‚Äôt doubt that in the next moment he she turns around and gives the kitten a smack
i got two older kittens and have a year old cat one of the kitten was not taking no for an answer he loves my grown cat she kept up the hate for months he would not let it go and eventually won her over now they re play buddies persistence pays off
the cat looks like it‚Äôs so beyond done that it forgot it had a tail for a sec
whats with the hat in the background it hurts my eyes cute cats tho
as the parent of teenagers i relate to grown kitties expression ‚Äòmake it stop please‚Äô
i love the moment at the end when the grown cat turns to look at the adorable monster and the kitten just freezes
that cat is contemplating on how it will kill you later for bringing in that creature
what is it with kittens and tails my kitten would play for hours with my dogs tail it was her favorite toy
why does the cat sorta look like jig saw is that just me
this entire video the older cat regrets his entire existence
your older cat is plotting your demise for this op so cute
based on the look on the adult cat s face it might be prudent tonight to put your shoes where he she can t reach them
i love your turkish van i have one too looks exactly the same
id get a new kitten id really love to because there everywhere outside in the spring but my cat would be pissed i did it before when i had another cat and the best advice i can give is to keep them in separate rooms and feed them both between the doors after about a month you can start to introduce them to each other the old cat needs to be the boss and the new cat should be treated like a sub pet let the old cat sleep on the bed and make the new cat sleep somewhere else it seems mean but cats are so territorial that its the right way to transition a new cat into the family its really hard especially when you adopt a kitten but you ll be happier later that you did this had cats for years
i m making this video to let you know how serious i am i even took off my top hat i also can you knock that shit off for five minutes steve
did the little one get shaved upper front legs for a vet visit or
looks like the older kitty isn‚Äôt too upset but this is what i‚Äôm worried about right now i‚Äôm considering getting a kitten there‚Äôs a neighbor guy who took in a stray cat and whoops babies there‚Äôs an adorable little orange tabby girl i just don‚Äôt know how my old man would take it he‚Äôs still not happy about the dogs my sister adopted a few years ago
couldn t keep my eyes off the hat thought it was floating upvote for the cat s patience
that kittens gonna lose its fucking mind when it realises it also has a tail that it can chase
this is why i m ascared to get a kitten fren for my cate
my neighbor has an amazing cat just like this what breed is it
for a few seconds i thought that top hat is floating magic
nermal i swear to f cking god i m going to ship you to abu dhabi
my kitty did the same with our older cat when we first got her she still does it sometimes i swear he does it on purpose for her
aww look at his little shaved drumsticks was he in the hospital
this reminded me of when i brought a kitten home last summer so my older cat wouldn t be so bored the first day or two miss kitty older cat was like kill it kill it with fire while bubby kitten just wouldn t go away she just wanted to make friends by about the third day miss kitty decided resistance was futile and approved of bubby even up to the point of allowing bubby to nurse even though miss kitty wasn t the birth mother that stopped after we got both of them spayed but they are great friends
my new kitten just hisses at my larger cat and freaks her out for no reason if that doesnt get better i might have to find a new home for her
that just made me laugh so loud that cat is just so not impressed
you just got him and the other cat is already tired of him üòÇ
it looks like it hates its future replacement i mean wouldn‚Äôt we all
hello darkness my old friend i ve come to talk with you again
i m gonna need another fookin ciggy to deal with this shit
me too years ago still does this to my older cat even though the younger is twice the size of the older
oh my god what monster did you bring home she‚Äôs excited over my tail my tail
me when someone send me a meme they ve never seen but that i ve already seen it times
i am so done with this shit initiate the look aka the mom stare
it s like the cat is in some kind of home interview for a documentary and this is her story
op i think you d better back away slowly and find a very good hiding place looks like big kitty is plotting where to bury the bodies lol
someone should photoshop a laz r beam coming out of her eyes into this
i love the pause at the end when momma turns around the the kid just freezes lol
you can see the back of an owl s eyes by looking in their ears
man i love barn owls what i d give to have one here in mt as a companion
owls everyone is fond of owls exept for mice and shreeeews
no most like this one scare the shit out of me i had some bad times dealing with owls as a kid nope
"i love all birds my dad owns a scarlet
macaw a snake and a cat and i know those aren t birds but he still owns them and every weekend he goes to the bird park that has parrots and owls"
i used to volunteer at a wildlife rehabilitation centre it s crazy how cute and sweet baby raccoons are and then they grow up and it s like a switch goes off
they are sooo cuuute in the beginning then get rid of it while you readily can
i once rescued an abandoned baby raccoon that was all alone next to a tree in my backyard the next morning i went to the store bought some kitten formula and fed it with a small bottle seconds later it went into a seizure turns out it had rabies won t be doing that again
he s here to steal your heart and then your garbage
adorable fact not conveyed in pictures of baby raccoons that those who have not encountered them may not know they purr just like a little kitten they snuggle into you curiously and purr
love racoons big and small such a misunderstood creature

you are absolutely correct thank you for correcting that
rocket is going to be pissed when he finds out y all leaked his baby photos
looks like some sort of bad ass hip hop rapper complete with bling about to drop some tunes
seems to me someone had just watched the fifth element when this cat was found dallas multipass anyone
give her some pats from our brood get permission first
i need to nap with this cat seniors are my favorite for long naps
fifth element must have just come out when you named her
may i ask what do you feed her i‚Äôm sure a good diet is key for a pets long life
please give this beautiful precious girl a little kiss on the forehead from me
i didn t even know cats could live that long what a badass
this reminds me of those old women who has a moustache good old girl
we have a year old leeloo her full name is leeloo dallas multicat i hope your leeloo continues to live a long happy life
she looks wise like the respected elder of a cat village
huh my coworker s cat s name is leeloo too what s it mean
i want to talk to you about that new cat food you re saving money on leeloo probably
so much living shows in her face sending her plenty of head scratches her years are such a blessing
out of all the r aww posts this is literally the only one ive said aww to and i dont like cats to much
we have a leeloo dallas multipass she is about your leeloo looks amazing
i absolutely love senior cat faces there s something so majestic about them i don t even think majestic is the correct word but i love them
as if a cat could possibly exude more righteous indignation here comes estelle kitty
fuck man when they said perfect being no one said it was a fucking cat
leeloo literally looks so done with everything and i relate i think this is the best picture i ve seen all night lmao i love leeloo so much tbh just from this picture üòÖüòÇ‚ù§
how amazing she s older than me i hope she still has some more years left in her
oh isn t she a fine girl look at that face how lucky you are to have her for such a long time
i just want to pet this kitty soooo much kittens are cute but older cats have so much heart and soul
he looks like the guide to an old rpg game i dunno he has that wise old man look
what a beautiful older lady there‚Äôs the feline equivalent of helen mirren right there
old cats are awesome mine is and still going strong‚ù§Ô∏èleeloo is gorgeous üòä
i had a year old persian cat had her since i was two years old but we gave her to my sisters friend once i moved out no pets allowed in my apt she‚Äôs still alive and thriving though i guess lol
my cat is named leeloo too hopefully mine gets that old to get her very own senior multipass
i m expecting to hear ben kingsley call me a stupid man cub
that is amazing i am so happy that she is able to live that long
i thought that white part on his neck was a legit white beard for a second the old and wise
that is a precious little face i wanna boop that nose very much üòäüòäüòäüòä
i can‚Äôt even take a picture of my dog maybe i‚Äôm a bad camera person or my dog is extremely energetic she‚Äôs a teacup poodle
having had a puppy before i commend you on your perseverance and skill
this is the same breed as my dog but sadly we didn t get him as a pup
yep looks like the grill is theirs for the season or
you think they ll be big enough to grill at the end of the season
you re probably not going to want to use that grill after seeing all the bird shit and bird mites left behind
you need to grill more often reminds me of the other year when wasps had built a huge nest in mine nearly overnight at first i was clueless on how to get it out of there then i realized that some problems just sorta solve themselves with fire
that s pretty cool that your grill produces it s own meat
you will be amazed at how fast they grow and clear out never to come back and then you can grill all you want they don‚Äôt build a nest in the same place twice
looks like some buffalo wings to me nobody has to know dave your secrets safe with me
my dad once fired up the snowblower without checking it was not nice squirrel or family of mice couldn t tell
i had a pair of robbins build a nest on my back door security light they had three chicks and would dive bomb me every time i used my back door thankfully it only took weeks from hatching for them to leave the nest so i can safely use my back door again
i m queen of the softies thank you for being a decent citizen of the planet ‚ù§Ô∏è
mmmm roasted bird now what type of seasoning hmmmmm
the season no in a few weeks you ll be grilling their distant kin
wow talk about bad location and timing no need to waste any gas and no need to pluck feathers
no no that s not how this works at all you re supposed to put the meat on the grill after the charcoal
fuck it i see as free wood for the grilling plus some free chicken
that moment when you almost made homemade fried chicken
i least you know whats for dinner next year im gonna quietly walk away now
this is the leverage you need to pull the trigger on a new grill
looks like you don‚Äôt need to go to the store for drummets
odd that chicken have now both lived and been cooked in that grill
either that or the grill came preloaded with kindling and chicken
this is the reason i have two grills i couldn t throw out the nest full of babies so i just bought a second one
didn‚Äôt know pigs had a similar pouch system to kangaroos
this is the real life equivalent to having pets in your inventory in mmorpg
this is why girl pants need proper pockets because i want this
a puppy a school bus and a huge gun something doesn‚Äôt fit
such a pretty girl love it when cats do this it s so god darned adorable
this makes me want a kitty so badly again they are so sweet and crazy
my cat makes these tiny little mews too to let me know she needs some more attention
she sounds like my little one well not so little anymore but still call her squeaker all the time she doesn t care as long as the treats keep coming
oh my god its so loud someone it might attack me mommyyyy yeah if you couldn‚Äôt tell this was a joke
what a sweet baby peace to you as you mourn the loss of your friend
what a beautiful kitty so sorry for your loss hope you‚Äôre remembering all of the good times
it s terrible but i think about this moment with each of my pups they are my only loved ones but you gave them a great life they might not have had otherwise you re the real angel
such a beauty she looks like such a good friend so sorry for your loss
awww what a beauty i‚Äôm so sorry for your loss we recently put down my year old kitty amp he is still dearly missed you can tell your kitty was so loved years of memories is amazing
acd they‚Äôre super smart amazingly driven and an absolute joy when you‚Äôre not crying your way through the teenage phase hahaha üëçüèª‚ù§Ô∏è
i miss my blue heeler now i ve been contemplating getting another or getting a red heeler
do heelers shed a lot i m trying to decide between a heller australian shepherd or border collie
so cute i have a year old red heeler best dog he s losing his hearing but is still a sweetie
in christchurch airport a border gaurd was walking down the line with a sniffer dog just before they got to us the dog had a massive derp moment and started rolling on the floor i jokingly asked the gaurd if we should wait she laughed and ushered us to go on just for the dog to finish up derping around and dash for my rucksack and start indicating on me if i hadn t taken the time to ask i would have successfully managed to smuggle the orange i had forgotten was in my bag into new zealand
when you lied on your resume to get the job and now you have no idea what you re doing
unfurtunately this doggo was fired for being a good boy
don t they normally have a vest on still cute as heck tho‚ò∫Ô∏è
i used to travel a lot for work and i would always see the same security dog at the airport i m pretty sure it recognized me because it always growled at me it might have been the drugs i had tho
i got him i got him i got him i got him i got him i got him
even the working dogs get attacked by the tail monster
i trust that puppy with my life how dare you create a post shaming it
i hate to be that guy but that tail was hiding kilos of high grade cocaine
judging from that guy s reaction this is not the first time
the guard trying to act like everything is fine is probably super embarrassed
he must have gotten a whiff of some crack in there you get it cuz he sniffed his butt ugh i m done
i mean he s got skill he actually manages to get the tail this could be what he s trained for
if i were an attacker in that airport and saw that it would definitely deter me from trying anything
this is probably a drug filled country and the dogs signal for suspicious smells is him chasing his tale little guy knows what‚Äôs up drug mules everywhere
the guard is like fuck i aint paid for this shit the dog is like drugs i smell drugs drugs drugs drugs woooo
i bet that tail will think twice before it wags again
at least the dog is doing something more than what some tsa agents in the usa accomplish
you sure that s a service dog aren t those usually wearning harnesses with markings on them
going around in circles and doing nothing seem like the standard tsa procedure to me
if he can catch his tail drug smugglers don t stand a chance
‚Äútheres drugs in my ass why are you not doing anything human‚Äù
he looks pretty highly trained i mean look at him he definitely got his tail
it takes skill to spin in circles like that and not get tangled just sayin
he is standing there trying to look professional and his partner is a doofus good stuff
dude you re embarrassing in fronti√®re of the wizard
the dog was tired of sniffing around he needed some playtime
lol to me this looks like ‚Äúi knew eating that super glue would make me itch dammit dam it all gotta get it gotta get it
did he bite his own leg and bring himself to the ground üòÇ
pretty much the equivalent of me browsing reddit at work but for dogs i guess
my dog usually did this when he had something about to come out of his butt usually it was an old sock or a paper towel he managed to snatch and gobble up before we could stop him miss my beau
if any dog at an airport will make me feel safe it‚Äôs that one
jokes on us it‚Äôs obviously an inside job the dog caught himself
that officer is probably trying not to lose his shit poor dude dogs just bored and having a good time and he‚Äôs stuck thinking ‚Äúevery fucking bad guy knows my dogs just mailing it in ‚Äù
only the trained accomplished the task of biting their own tail this trully is a securyti dog
i go through union station in la every day and sometimes there s a dohs dog there and she s obviously super bored her handler let s her run in circles around the other officers for mins at a time
handler do you have the suspect in sight dog i m tailing him now
haha the look on the dudes face who has the dog it s like he wants to laugh but must remain serious
that s a degree surveilance disguised as a boofy dog
on a serious note dog will chase their tail or lick their butts if their an ass l glands need to be expressed most people have no idea it needs to be done and that a grommer will usually do it
hey he caught what he was after i‚Äôll call that a success
his handler s face is hilarious bill gets killer mike s got bonesaw and i get betsy the buttmuncher
there s a bomb at this airport him his butt is the bomb
clearly there s a bomb in his tail he s doing a good job
i‚Äôm not but i‚Äôm pretty sure that dog has drugs up its butt
that dog is just distracting you while security goes through your bags
he she is having fun on the job lord knows we all do some just do it more than others
he doesn t have his work vest on he s off the clock
i was going through security one time and a handler had a dog and was clearly in the process of training him took the pup down the line sniffing people as they walked by then all of the sudden the handler stops the line pulls out a toy and plays with the dog for like minutes dog apparently needed a play break once he had played for a bit they opened the line back up and he went back to sniffin
that s a bomb dog who just realized he is in fact the bomb and is trying to find himself
sir u are under urrest please come with me wuit please come stop i need halp
bet he had a balloon of heroin he was smuggling in his ass
he‚Äôs only chasing his tail because he found all the drugs and has nothing to do also he may have snorted half of them when looking for them
he‚Äôs clearly inserting dominance over the terrorist
if what i have heard its true that dog might outrank him
not cute this sort of thing can indicate neurological problems this dog should be seen by a vet immediately
since the dogs get hooked on drugs so they can smell them and want them clearly this dog did a couple of bumps before arriving to work when i do it it s always we re calling the cops
human hold up this is a really important moment for my species i hope you understand
ah i want to scratch the hinder for the dog he really wants it
isn t that a stress or anxiety signal from a dog i don t know dogs very well but i think abnormal behavior like that is probably a warning sign that the dog needs better social emotional conditions or adjustments
or his tail is the biggest drug dealer in the southwest usa but he can t get his boss to move in
actually it s a very effective way if someone doesn t pat the good boy while walking near him then we should consider him her a suspect
he is highly trained do you not see how mar up his tail he can get
why is it always golden retrievers that bite their own tail
i think he found drugs he just didn‚Äôt bark he licked
when the contact high from smelling all of the luggage starts to kick in
highly trained indeed üôÑ lol or it s a corrupt sniffing dog who tried to smuggle too much of the drug evidence
i hope he doesn‚Äôt find the heroin he hid up his own ass
sir your mobile drug sensor appears to have a malfunction in its central processing unit it appears to be falsely alarming on itself
he sits when he smells drugs but he s still a doggo
seems like the two legged variety spend a lot of time doing that too
i swear i have seen this dog is this in the amsterdam airport
that is his minute osha mandated tail break not to be confused by his minute osha mandated bark break
dios mio mi perro es estupido the poor cop probably
smuggler level put cocaine on the security dog s tail
i have best airport security in my country do you have in your country or not
is this the same pupper that wanted scratches by the conveyor belt haha
if he can catch his own tail he undoudibtly can catch a terrorist
hehe last time i saw one of those airport security dogs suddenly go beserk and it‚Äôs handler had to toss him a ball so it can find something to do instead it was so funny
i mean no matter much you train it a golden will be a golden they re probably the goofiest of dogs but hey at least they re unbelievably adorable
i mean true it takes a very experienced doggo to successfully catch it s tail
please stop people are staring amp x b dog that tail is the terrorists and you know it
i got you now trying to highttail it out of here huh dog probably
i know your not supposed to pet the dogs who are doing important jobs at the airport but damn i wanna pet the dog
most useful thing airport security has done all day
security guy said ‚Äúget the perp ‚Äù but doggo heard ‚Äúget the pup‚Äù so he did and didn‚Äôt let go
any highly trained security dog agent knows all tails are upto no good including there own job well done promote that man
can‚Äôt tell if he‚Äôs thinking ‚Äúomg so bored no one has drugs today ‚Äù or ‚Äúwheeeeee that last guy had some good stuff ‚Äù i love dogs üòÜ
that doggo is just trying to get some tail on his break leave him alone
he is doing his best to keep us both safe and happy
he s thinking just this morning i sniffed out two drug lords coming through security one gun in a carry on and one bomb in the trunk of a car i m a goddamn superstar and now i m taking a fucking break to chase my tail fuck ya ll
plot twist the sniffer dog is smuggling drugs up his butt
we supose to be workin rn but i‚Äôm just gonna take my break
theres a doggo who comes to my vet clinic and he took two tours in afghanistan and hes the biggest goof ever hes now and his favorite activities include rolling on the floor while groaning and wiggling excitedly while getting pets goldens are just amazing
they are catching an extremely dangerous criminal called ‚Äòdoggo tail‚Äô who always runs away refusing to be caught
sometimes when you re out with your boy you just want to chase a little tail
probably still smarter than a lot of airport security
i ve got a scent someone s trying to smuggle dog shit on the plane
don‚Äôt fuck with that dog he caught his tail that takes serious training
an itchy ass sucks whether you‚Äôre on the job or not
he caught his tail so i don t really see the place for sarcasm
is this in lima i swear when we were at the lima airport in peru we saw this exact goofball dog
dog s just demonstrating his contribution to the war on drugs
i like how his handler is acting like i don t know this clown at the end of my leash stop it rufus
to be fair security dogs are allowed to play when they‚Äôre on break often times i see their handlers have chew toys or call break and they‚Äôll be able to be dogs again it‚Äôs the turning it on part that matters
i mean he caught it so many dogs spend their entire lines hoping to achieve what he did while he was bored at work i d say he s got more training than any of those scrubs
that soldier is trying to look all intimidating and the dog is acting like the dog from up lmao
i ve never seen a tog chasing its tail that much huh
can any of you say you don‚Äôt do this for at least a few minutes at work
highly trained animals are allowed to be who they are as well human you
when your training betrays you looks like his habit is now public knowledge üò§
that dog is going to get fired i just know it üòÜüòÜüòÜüòÜüòÜ
did you by chance have to fight seven people for her
i know that not everybody will find you wife attractive i see her just a normal women but for you you may see her as a princess or the most gorgeous being in the intier world i think your a good husbandüëç
must be feeling a little dumb this morning but why exactly is op getting downvotes on comments like gt same i get that he posted a pic of his wife and not some fluff thingy but the only rule it looks like he s breaking and i use that term loosely is rule don t think he owns her if she makes him go awwww well that s what it is i wasn t aware that postings had to be about things that make others go awwww but i could be wrong
looks like she was cute years ago now it s just cringey
nah potentially without the year old gender studies major hair fashion sense and ghetto queen nails let me guess wiccan practicioner subscribes to jezebel unshaved pits and a wookie bush
my cat went missing sunday his name was felix feel free to use if you‚Äôd like
that what i‚Äôve heard we‚Äôve been doing that also put litter box outside cans of tuna called all the shelters and put up a bunch of posters even though it would be annoying i‚Äôm hoping he‚Äôll just walk in like nothings wrong
amazing picture beautiful cat üòç maybe that was a sign for you to stay in switzerland
where was this taken i am going tomorrow and would like to see him
i met so many affectionate cats in switzerland just the streets it was one of my favorite things about the place
oh man if i could draw this is what i would try to draw
i just scrolled by and saw that picture for a split second first thought cute cat second thought that looks like switzerland came back to check and i was right i m clad you had such a friendly welcome
oh man one time i was in interlaken and there was this adorable cat that climbed onto my shoulders and let me pet it for a while wish i could ve taken him home
did it have a collar did you ask someone to ship him to you
i‚Äôm pretty sure i saw this same cat on my hike grindelwald right and took a bunch of photos of him
that photo is amazing you should enter it for some competitions i had a similar experience recently with a cat i befriended on holiday i am absolutely heartbroken and in pain to have said goodbye to him
wow the countryside looks beautiful now i want to go dx
i want to steal your mans jk or am i congrats to him
hope he s not planning on working in an office i bet he ll experience a hypnosis related mishap and end up working construction looks like the type
thank you for giving him a happy new life you‚Äôre awesome shelter dogs are the best
looks like she was on the kill list what happened to her neck
thank you so much for adopting and not shopping and for posting it on here i was just feeling salty about a post a few above this one showing a bunch of puppies that were clearly bred i wish the forum banned breeders bc there is nothing aww about millions of other puppers dying in shelters every year
you should post a follow up pic in months or so when he is all filled up with love
awesome the beginning of a beautiful amp happy loved filled life
great just what the world needs a person searching for karma by getting a cheap dog what a hero
gt he was on the kill list at the pound can you just not please the whole dur he was going to be killed i m so amazing thing isn t needed on this sub jsut post a picture of something cute
i work in the shelter for every animal you save we kill it s like an abortion clinic but people actually care
that disgusts me that kill shelters are still a thing and that a puppy can even be on the kill list
uhmm we need an update picture cant tease us with the little good boy and not show us the adult good boy
our humane society doesn‚Äôt euthanize dogs or cats we don‚Äôt really have a stray problem in my town i‚Äôve never seen a stray dog at all here in a town of salem keizer oregon
i could never work at a kill shelter i‚Äôd bring them all home
oh my gosh they act exactly like house kittens üòÑ haha and momma yells at the little guy who ventured to far üòç
can you put up a dog house or open sided box structure for her if she s coming back yearly she might appreciate a little more shelter they re adorable
was this a huge selling feature when you bought the place i works pay extra for this feature as well
just a little more information this is the nd year i ve owned the house and nd time i ve seen it happen but basically this bobcat is smaller then last years mom and i can only think that it s actually one of the kittens from last year the little space under the roof on the right is actually where she gave birth and the kittens like to sleep it s pretty decent shelter also i dont want to do anything more then just put up a camera because i ve seen a few people suggest building a dog house or something but they are wild animals and needed to be treated as such and cant get used to humans literally last week in another part of town some guy decided to pick up one of the kittens in his yard and ended up getting stitches so as much as they are adorable they are still wild and dangerous i have been super tempted to put up some kind of ball up there though lol
that mama cat is gorgeous i d be super tempted to throw a ball up there too
it would indeed take much of every ounce of my self control not to abduct one of those kittens from the rooftop and hug him and squeeze him and call him george and so you sir u littlebill are a true zen master in control of his emotions i am ready to learn from you though i am most likely not worthy
omg i loved when the momma bobcat yelled at the baby for his shenanigans haha
on news at ‚Äúman hides camera to get secret video of multiple pussies‚Äù
this is like watching diy planet earth and i‚Äôm very into it
this is by far the best thing i ve seen all day thanks for posting
ah that sun baked bobcat placenta smell must be springtime on an az roof
i now know what get down from there in bobcat sounds like
the close up on that baby bobcat belly was awesome lol
i thought it was great one year that i put one up in a tree to watch a robin nest this is a million times better than my birdie cam
mama sure gave the kitten on the parapet a talkin to
mommy kinda sound like a car alarm not what i as expecting you‚Äôre very lucky
aaaaaaa this is so cute i m dying bobcats are my favorite big cat
i can‚Äôt express enough how much i appreciate this footage and i don‚Äôt know why but thank you
awww i love them i‚Äôm in az too but not near enough to the desert to get bobcats just feral cats and urban coyotes
your roof must be ideal if she keeps coming back adorable
poor mama cat trying to bathe and her kittens are climbing all over her how on earth can you get anything done my entire day would be spent watching this adorableness
you have more restraint than i do op if this was my house i might suddenly be the proud owner of bobcats
i love how hey you get down offa there is the same in every species
lucky you i will probably got fired from the job just on the hours i would be watching the cam
i m fucking dying over this i love her yelling at her baby it s pretty adorable
you def gotta throw some toys up there or even an old rough rug for them to lie and sharpen their claws on adorable
watching this has been the highlight of my day thank you for sharing
this looks like my roof in tucson kinda creepy but super cute
i like when the mom yells at the one telling it to get down
so what‚Äôs it like having a bobcat family living in your yard
you are so lucky sorry for yelling i‚Äôm just really excited for you
i wonder if there are other birthing roofs in the area
forgive me if this sounds like a whine but i want a house with baby bobcats on the roooooof
it looked like she was saying hey get down from there
huh was wondering if these kitties and other larger kittens would meow as house cats kittens then momma bobcat made that sound ü§î almost like a coyote
i would totally and completely watch the hell out of a live stream of this
wow thanks for sharing they are so cute and she is pretty
it s one of her babies that comes back to their childhood roof give birth cycle continues
i know it s super cute and i want to appreciate you for appreciating and recording that thanks
i m pretty sure you haven t seen a rodent anywhere in your vicinity for years this is very cool
what area do you live in if you don t mind me asking
i thought this was the same house as the one with the roof cat on the pillow
how did you find them up there i‚Äôm picturing you hearing random noises and then going up to the roof and being greeted by a mom bobcat and the cutest kittens ever however the mom is super protective and attacks you
this roof cat needs a pillow maybe a couple of pillows
so ah where is the extended edition directors cut cause i could watch this all day
gimme your address so i can walter white a pizza up there
my crazy self would try to get one and make it my pet
get down from there is easy to understand no matter what mom says it
can you put up one of those large cat trees up there it will be so much to see the cubs play on that i can help fund this
there s something about a cat walking up to a video camera to investigate that just makes me laugh like crazy
you need to setup an account on twitch and live stream this
just when you thought the world was only a negative black hole filled with atrocities and hate this comes along and you realize it is but it has this in it too thank you stranger
so cute can you maybe put down something for them to sleep on
your a real one for not calling animal control or anything like that
dear sir you have used the amount of squee i have available for this year
after the bobcat leaves with its cubs it returns to its own domicile to watch all the video she s captured of you during her visit to your home
oh damn they make a barking noise i had no idea thanks for this cool post op
i don t know what i expected a bobcat to sound like but it wasn t quite that neat
how do they get to the roof and how to they go downstairs
op is living my dream where do i have to live to have a bobcat giving birth on my rooftop
i know by the roof style that this is an arizonan house lol hello fellow arizonan
how long did the first litter and mom stay in the roof just curious
i killed a bobcat a couple of years ago by mistake i still feel horrible
mama cat shouting to the kitten to get down from there lol
do they stay there throughout the year as a home or only as a birthplace
wtf i thought these animals only existed on the discovery channel
you should let your neighbors know so they don‚Äôt leave their pets outside with bobcats strolling about
good job you‚Äôre observing nature but not interfering well done
i love the end of the clip where the mom is yelling at her kid to get down
i love how my mama kitty is like b get off the roof what the hell you doing lol
at the end you can see her saying get down from there to the kittens ü§£
beautiful creatures we really should take better care of the land we all share
leave them a bowl of milk or a plate of deli turkey or something d
the one kitten was like ‚Äúhey mom is this supposed to be here ‚Äù
how long did it take you to choose the clip to use i can imagine spending hours
this is fantastic i love when she scolds the climbing baby i imagine her saying the kitten‚Äôs full name like ‚Äúrobert james anderson you get down here this instant ‚Äù
omg when the kitten is in front of the camera and we could see its fuzzy little belly omg so cuuuuuuute
that s dope we have one that sets up every year under our elm and i never once thought to put up a camera
can you hear them jumping around on the roof from inside the house
the mom looked like she said ‚Äúget yo ass back down here‚Äù in bobcat
dude this is highly illegal illegal to be this cute
awww god bless you for letting them stay there and letting them be i m sure mama appreciates being in a place she doesn t have to worry about a lot of predators hopefully they never intersect with everyone else in the neighborhood and get to live peacefully until they re big enough to go out on their own
you should do weekly videos so we can watch the kitties more lol
i think if it has babies and you aren‚Äôt close it should be referred to as robert cat lt ducks gt
soooooooo what s your air b amp b price around this time of year
i take it your camera has an led indicator on it kitty training for chasing laser pointers
pleeeaase give us more also if nothing else put a ball and water up there i m jeally
i think that not doing anything is probably a great decision presumably she has other places she could have picked instead and she picked that one because it already works
i could watch all day long love mom chiding the cub at the end
not the cutest thing i‚Äôve seen today it‚Äôs the cutest thing i‚Äôve seen all year
just be super super careful with a bobcat on your roof a bobcat won t normally attack a human but if they feel like their cubs are threatened they might
all cats are basically the same the only difference is their size habitat diet and how they react to humans
thank you for doing this and sharing it this is so damn adorable
kitten climbs the roof mama bobcat get down from there little one or i‚Äôll whoop your butt
thank you for posting this if i didn t keep chickens i would love to host some bobcat fam
awesome to see but i really wouldn‚Äôt feel comfortable with a bobcat hanging out in my neighborhood for very obvious reasons
next year can you please also install a laser pointer that switches on and moves around randomly every now and then
i knew that cats were liquid a liter of kittens is the proof
cat litters are so fun to watch there s always at least one adventurous kitten and from what i ve seen they tend to get into trouble i m not a specialist though so this is just anecdotal story
can you hear their feet pitter pattering on the roof from inside
what model camera are you using i ve been looking to set up a camera on a nest in my shed and the quality of yours is great
every year that‚Äôs so interesting that she comes back
pretty cat i can see why she has a litter every year
awesome video those are ocelots not bobcats by the way
those are the most adorable little robertkittens please keep us updated as they grow
i don t know why i was imagining construction equipment giving birth on your roof but i really like my headcannon more
i m guessing the proximity to people would keep away the local predators like foxes coyotes etc
oh boy you better be ready to pay a daily cat tax now
you are such a great host and it almost seems like the kittens know they are being watched lol
i ve had bobcat before surprisingly wasn t very gamey just tastes like rather bland meat
bobcat or lynx also do they only give birth to as much as two why do house cats so to speak give birth to a litter of say vs this
gonna need vids daily since they live in frontth of the camera
i wish this was on live stream i d watch it when i m having a lot of anxiety
i want to buy you an internet connection and amazon you a webcam so we can stream live
i don‚Äôt speak cat but i know she said ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt get your ass down from there‚Äù
all fund and games until mom gives out free scritches
this might be my favorite video of all time please upload more
how old are they my cat gave birth to four lovely kittens about two weeks ago they haven t opened their eyes yet
serious question what do they do for food in an urban area
she‚Äôs so beautiful oh my gosh those babies and her scolding at the end do you have an instagram or any way to follow future videos
i have a bobcat that frequently passes my window i hadn t considered the possibility until i saw your amazing video but i really well and truly hope to see bob cat kittens pass by soon you are very lucky
wow i never realized that was what a bobcat sounded like
how did you know about this the first time it happened pitter patter on your roof
i think she used the baby s full name when yelling at him robert snarlikins cat junior get down this instant
reminds me of my parenting being self absorbed half watching then hmm something‚Äôs happening then oh shit honey get down
i‚Äôm happy you‚Äôve given the mama a place to give birth
same thing happens to me when i try to take a bath too bobcat momma
it would amazing if you could set up a live webcam stream so we can watch any time
this is so cool i watched this like a hundred times
i know these are dangerous animals but damn if they don‚Äôt look like house cats fooling around
oh what is your pet situation has the headcount changed at all you know what with predators living on the roof and all
where did the little one go did it come back the suspense is killing me
mom cleaning herself unperturbed ‚Äú wait jimmy jimmy goddammit get down right now jimmy ‚Äù
super cute i wanna watch them all day thanks for being such an awesome person
i would never but oh my god it would be tempting to take one of those cuties and try and raise it and domesticate it what adorable kitties
who d ve thunk that being cats would not only survive but thrive
could literally here the bobcat momma say get down here you lil piece of shit
i‚Äôm so glad you put the camera up and shared it with us so freaking cute and thank you for giving them a safe space
op used reveal found a bobcat bundle bobcat bundle requires protecc such magestic creatures
i love the way she called out when the little one went over
why does this say near me i‚Äôm in a semi suburban area where do i go to see baby bobs
aren t you worried one day you will come out to the garden and a bobcat will come flying towards you from the roof
i love how she yells at the baby to ‚Äúbe careful because how many times have i told you to stop climbing that thing you‚Äôre going to fall again ‚Äù
it s so cute when they practice their murders aawwwwwwzzz seriously though i love it
i love how shes yelling at him to get down from wherever he was going üòç
dont mind me asking but there are many videos here of a mother animal and her children but not so much of the father why dont the dads stick around their family
i have two stray cats that picked me i so want a bobcat
ah when the mom started chirping at the cub was super awwww
small bobcats should definitely be called bobkittens
this is so awesome i have yet to see one in the wild yet and thus was super bummed illinois voted to start hunting them again
what a wonderful experience thanks for sharing the footage with us
so if you had kids every year for years would you love them equally or have favorites
that ended too soon so freaking cute it s seemed like the momma cat was telling that child to get the fuck down from there right now
what does the bobcat say apparently a yow yow yow yow yow yow
i hope the second bobcat didn t fall down op confirm both still alive
i feel like you should put some toys up there for them crinkly balls catnip mice tennis balls stuffed rabbits
such a cute family and i‚Äôm so proud that great mama
no one would have believed you if you hadn t recorded it this is so cute
you should send this footage to a local conservation wildlife group i bet this kind of footage of a mother bobcat and her young may be relatively rare i m sure they would love to have access to your tapes amp x b very cool video thank you for providing a respawn point for these beautiful animals
pretty sure the market value of your home just went up
thank you for being such an accommodating human for your roofguests and thank you for sharing some of their antics with us
hilarious how she starts yelling at the kid to get the fuck off the roof
oh my goodness you are so lucky to be chosen thanks for sharing üíï
they are so adorable and it pleases my soul that you have not interfered with them thanks for sharing this i feel so sick at heart sometimes about the environment and encroachment on animal living spaces it s just wonderful to see wild things healthy and happy like this
if you do have to resell the house this should add at least a million to the value
you little shit get down from there i swear to god i m gonna leave you up there this time
we used to hear one bopping around on my mom s roof when she lived in tucson we loved that she was up there
seamus jeffrey mcgruder get down here right now before i get up there and drag you down by your tail stub
the kitten jumps out of the frame at the very end and the mom gets very worried just incredible drama better than of network tv
do you know da stream i would pay a for da stream maybe even tree fiddy
one of the best things i ve seen on the internet ever thanks for posting
just a litter of two super cool video thanks for posting
thank you for being kind to them by providing safety and not shooing them away
they must smell your scent on the equipment to come up to the equipment she s probably telling them it s old wish there was sound love cats thanks for the vid
are you allowed to hunt bobcats just asking for an uncle
their little ears their little leaps thanks for this
doesn t look like giving birth maybe chills out on your roof
it s not fair that the kittens look like the non rip your face off kind of kitty
i love when they jump on mama‚Äôs head at around and she doesn‚Äôt even flinch but keeps on licking
y‚Äôall just chill with bobcats and stuff out there or
i love the mom towards the end get down get down i said get down from there
you need to get one and raise it to be your companion
the curious cub jumps up and moms like ‚Äúhey hey hey hey‚Äù
this needs to be some kind of live streaming channel i d donate
these are what cats are supposed to be and dogs are supposed to be wolves damn humans taking advantage of every animal on earth to the point that you guys create entire species to be your co dependent slaves and yet you all decry human slavery all the time when your entire civilization was built upon slavery in agriculture the double standards and rampant hypocrisy is disgustingly shameful
serious question because i may move to tucson or phoenix but don t people generally how shall we say it send it when they see bobcats roaming their streets or land
that s gotta increase your property value i know i d pay extra
that s awesome i ve always loved bobcats so i m sort of jealous i don t have any living on my roof
i love the look at the end when the one climbs up like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre pushing your luck bub‚Äù then she even said so cracks me up from one mother of a young child to another ha
it‚Äôd be great if you could get the birth next time thanks so much for sharing this world class
it s always interesting animals go to the camera to inspect probly cause it s out of place compared to everything else i guess
just got back from a long lax round trip leaving off daughter to go back to prague this was a perfect lift to a grinding day
i love it when she stands up and yells get the hell down you silly kit
my thoughts ‚Äúhow cool is that until they eat my dogs‚Äù üò¶
how do animals always know to come up to the camera it‚Äôs like they know someone‚Äôs watching and no one can convince me it‚Äôs random these kitties aren‚Äôt sniffing around other random roof tiles and stuff
i m pretty doped up right now on morphine yay asthma but that dog barking at her puppies at the end was too cute
i know its wrong but now i see why people take in wild animals like this i d totally have to steal a kitten
good god they are just tooooooo adorable i can t stand it so much cute that now i have to go into the living room and kick my dogs favorite toy just to feel a little testosterone because i think i feel my brovaries getting bigger take your upvote
oh my god the part where he jumps up in front of the camera and you can see his furry little tummy üòçüòçüòç
i d like to see someone try to rob your house through that way
we now know how to say young man you get down from there right now in bobcat
towards the end she was like ‚Äúget yo ass down now ‚Äù
where did the little kitty go mama started crying for it
holy cow i instantly recognized that the mom was scolding her cub to get the fuck down that s a rooftop idiot
i thought this was gunna be another gif of bobcat excavators
fellow tucson resident grew up in deep marana and never got to see big cats moved to the nw side of town and would see bob cats a few times a year
you have done a great service to all of us here at reddit sir
how did you first realize that was happening on your roof
that is so adorable you could set up a live cam and make some money
i need to know what happened to the curious cat that went off frame the mom was looking for him and then
they‚Äôre so cute is it the same mom so is she having kids every year
i adore how mama has that look of i know we are safe here so lovely
every year what happened to all the other bobcat kids
those wild cats are lynx not bobcats way to small but still supper amazing stoked on that bobcats are twice the size super gorgeous though
i would literally stare at the monitor all day long if i have a wild life camera like this
awwww thank you for always welcoming this beautiful mama back for her to carry on her amazing bloodlines such a wonderful experience thank you also for setting up a camera those two lil fluffy rascals are absolutely beautiful as is their wonderful mama i am smitten üíúüíúüíúüíú üê± üò∫ üò∫
omy what an amazing mama see her chuffing to get off the camera hahahahha so gorgeousssssüòóüòóüòóüòôüòôüòôüíóüíóüíóüíóüíó
this is out there but which security camera is that arlo
wait why is the majority of your house underground the roof seems like feet above the ground
thank you for sharing them with us they are beautiful you are right though they would eat you alive a man tried to give me a bob cat kitten once i go to his house and it smelled horrible and the carpet and curtains and furniture were all shreaded lol
i love how she yells at them at the end hey get down from there moms gonna mom
this made my day but if it had only happened once before how were you sure enough it would happen again to set up a camera also is it the same time of year or did you only set it up after she gave birth again
you should consider getting your roof re coated you‚Äôll save yourself a lot of money and headache down the road
perfect mom behavior leave me alone i m taking a bath go play with your brother wait get down from there you little shit
its fascinating to me the idea of maternal instincts in animals because this cat is chill as fuck grooming herself and relaxing but as soon as one of the kittens is too far away she immediately goes into monitor mode and acts chirping at the kitten to return a wild cat with what many would consider a very low iq compared to humans has more parenting skills than my shitty ass sister in law
whoah what a weird sound the mama makes i dont know why i thought she would meow like a house cat
this is awesome i would definitely watch this live stream i‚Äôll just keep replaying it seems like live streaming
i m sleepy so i thought it was a cat until it meowed
love how momma is fine with those little ones playing and ruff housing then the curious dude gets up past the cam and momma barks at him to ‚Äúget your ass down from there ‚Äù fade out
have you thought of adding anything up there like some kind of shelter for when it rains
thanks for this it has to be a blast for you good job
she s like let me goddamn bathe myself you fucking evil heathens
yo what fucking alien language was that bobcat speaking
cuteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
this would make an amazing live stream i d watch these little babies all day
i had a rabbits in my basement but i ve never seen anything like that
make sure they stay safe from the local satanic woodland critters
brandon stark you come down from there this instant
believe it or not this is actually a rare cat subspecies of bobcat a common name for it is the arizona billcat they‚Äôre extremely similar the regular bobcats but on average roughly millimeter shorter give or take and have slightly longer ear tufts when in heat a lot of female cats will make a call that sounds virtually indistinguishable from bill murray‚Äôs deepest side killing laugh
the ending where she tells him to come down this instant üòÇ
you should put some food and a bed up for them next time i mean if your gonna be in there home might aswell pay rent
please start a live stream of this i want to watch this little family
can you go live with this i d like to check in to watch her and kittens she speaking to me surprised me
those ain t the bobcat scream your hearing my wife a little frisky
this is so fucking spectacular bobcats are so rarely seen in the wild much less on a roof year after year in what looks like a tropical or warm city this is so heartwarming to see have you told your local forest service that they re around i m sure they d be really happy to see a healthy bobcat family
nothing better than cat pee deep down into your walls
love how momma is fine with those little ones playing and ruff housing then the curious dude gets up past the cam and momma barks at him to ‚Äúget your ass down from there ‚Äù fade out
they re cute but i imagine it stinks really bad up there
i see us as these kittens we wonder around this world so careless that we never realize we are being watched
love how momma is fine with those little ones playing and ruff housing then the curious dude gets up past the cam and momma barks at him to ‚Äúget your ass down from there ‚Äù fade out
awww bobcats are so cute i m shocked that they sell bobcat tails as keychains but i bought one anyway
they must smell your scent on the equipment to come up to the equipment she s probably telling them it s old wish there was sound love cats thanks for the vid
they look cute but i don t wanna die by petting them
aww i have a kitten well cat but he has no one to play with his parents suck
and you didn t throw a pillow down to them you monster
i now know what get down from there in bobcat sounds like
north tucson by chance i swear those roofs look familiar
mommy at the end be like ‚Äúyou get down from there right this minute ‚Äù
imagine finding a cute cat in your backyard adopting it and then it grows into this cute as fuck bobcat
all organic anti burglary system also mama cat yelling get down there x
this is one of the best things i ve ever seen i m so jealous how adorable üòª
dude make this a payed live stream i would watch bobcats playing for fucking hrs
oh great so the kit escapes by climbing on the camera
i m fairly drunk but regardless i love you dude for tolerating these amazing cats
she cant even bathe in peace please put a ball up there it wont hurt anyone
thank goodness i was thinking i d be seeing a graphic birth of a bobcat
if i ever move back to the states i hope to get a wild animal license and pick up a rescue bobcat i have a friend who does this and they can be pretty much trained to the level of house cats my friend s cats mostly stay indoors now and even sleep with him on the bed
i love how the mom immediately got up after the kitten climbed up the roof i could jist hear her saying hey you get back her right now young man young lady
the internets have spoken may the live stream be with you
you need to make updates frequently of all the footage you get it them i need to see more
i can legit hear the mom say ‚Äúbobby get down here this instant ‚Äù
they re so beautiful you have a nice little spot for them in that corner
is this like a reddit wide meme now to have cute wild animals have babies on your property
jimmy get the hell down from there you ll hurt yourself
fun fact bob cats can keep up with a mini atv no problem
oh my god cat mom screams on a small child climbing the roof how much care she is and her reaction is so interesting
animals at least mamals and birds are great parents full of loving patience and care when kids are young and then fuck them off when they need to make their own living if we were like that we would be a healthy society
thanks for sharing beautiful clip cheered me up watching
little one jumps on the ledge mama get back down here
so adorable and sweet kitten these are where is this
non arizonans should know that bobcats are extremely dangerous despite the appearance
this just made my day a few kitties better which is a lot thank you gt ‚Ä¢ lt
did something happen to the st cub the mother seemed a bit stressed out when it disappeared
typical sibling behavior curious and brave shy mama s boy
hi i humbly request you to please get the mama cat spayed believe me she does not want to have litters after litters you have the power to change her life for the better please get in touch with the tnr volunteers in and around your area you can make a big difference
"kittens let s play let s play let s play
momma you kids best calm the fuck down"
were you the miracle child of buddha and jesus in the previous life to been graced with this luck this lifetime
simply awesome made my day thanks for the share sends e beer
seems like a precarious position for curious kitties
the kittens have blue eyes and the momma has tan eyes does the iris color change as they mature or is there a range of eye colors that they keep throughout their lives
the part at the end was like the mother bobcat shouting darn it kid stop climbing up or you re going to get stuck there
that s awesome the mom must feel like it s a safe place to come back every year epic of u to not have them removed u should try leaving a couple toys there and see wut ur camera catches lol
did you try to find this it s owners in craig s list
mom is like bob bob get down here this instant bob mccat if you don t get down here right now i will call your dad and he may very well eat you
notices boy climbing hey get down you little bugger how many times have i told you
this is super cute but have you thought about calling someone to do a catch spay and release i‚Äôm not an expert just a chick that watches kitten lady on youtube from time to time lol but i‚Äôm just wondering have you thought about doing that so she doesn‚Äôt have more baby strays
at i can just about hear her yelling i said get down from there lol
why is eveyrthing on this sub now a every year every day every week this animal does this routine like come on
cat parents are incredibly patient with their kids playing on top of them
i think they might have guessed where the camera was
i did not expect a tiny dog to come out of that kitty‚Äôs mouth super cute video though
grand grandma grandma ma daughter or all birthed by the same mama
this footage is probably really valuable academically to the people that study this kind of stuff you should share it with them it would be a great tool for understanding behaviour habitat encroachment diet hunting habits and patterns morbidity rates etc its amazing
so you have nore footage uploaded or even a livestream ü§ó
i want to see an entire journey of this little family they re so cute
litter is for puppies a group of kittens is a kindle
ur roof looks like the perfect place to set up for star gazing and movie night and cuddles unless it rains then ur doomed
i somehow knew you lived in tucson my grandparents used to have a cat that was half bobcat was a really cool cat nice kitty
ahhh you should stream it on patreon for wildlife charity donations do nudes too
where do you live i d never leave the house be too busy watching the camera feed
i like how you got k upvotes but you only got about karma
this is the highest amount of upvotes i have ever seen
bobcats do not have those white spots on their ears and they have a much thicker build to them i searched for images of them and compared the two different cats that is a ocelot
definitely seems like a mix of bobcat and something else
do bobcats attack humans are you worried about this or are they small enough that it‚Äôs not a big deal if you run into it this might be a dumb question because i‚Äôve never seen a bobcat in person so for all i know i could be asking if lions can attack people lol
putting camera must be like having your own private cartoon network
can this be a yearly routine i want to see another post like this next year
near the end the mum was like ‚Äòoy get down from there timothy no jumping ‚Äô
next time grab them all and have them spayed and neutered
oh my gosh this is so precious thank you for sharingüíñ
look at her get up and yell when the kitten jumps over the camera johnny you get down off that roof right now oh wait
plot twist mother bobcat shows her bobcat community surveillance footage of the humans nesting below her
wow i live in tucson too i ve seen so many bobcats when i go out hiking near sabino i would be tempted to have them as pets
you should give them a ball or something üôà i just want to watch them play oh damn can you set up a stream on twitch or something and just live stream i‚Äôd watch that
so how big is your roof it kinda looks like ice is everywhere and then you can see your roof
i can see why great spot away from predators shade a cozy bedtime nook oh get the fuck down from there kevin
me awww awwww awwww so cute awww what the hell is that noise
damn that bobcat is getting laid more often than me
i relate to the that mama on a deep spiritual level
these are obviously scripted actors he looked right at the camera and started playing in perfect view it s a shame the things people fake for karma anymore
does your new pet chihuahua go missing every year too
this is really cool can you hear them when you were in the house and they are moving around
that‚Äôs awesome you probably won‚Äôt have mice or snakes around your house either
the mom telling the cub to get down from there at the end lol children of all species ‚Äùget down‚Äù
bobcats are on my family place in ct though i have never seen kittens just a single adult at a time who walks along the territory road
we also have jaguars in arizona and buffalo these are at very opposite ends of the state
i like the mom at the end noticeably saying get down from there
bobcat kittens bobkits bobbins bobbits like hobbits but with bobcats
so cats do meow at each other that one youtube video lied
i d be so thrilled to have found out these are hiding on my roof
oh no don‚Äôt be so hard on yourself it‚Äôs the right gut reaction this is just a very special and unusual case
i just melted look at thems playing up there üò≠ i wish i were this blessed in life
op i don t want to do anything more than just put up a camera they are wild animals and needed to be treated as such itt everyone telling op how to intervene
what kind of camera set up do you use im interested in setting something up in my backyard
i don t want to come across as an asshole but isn t it a little dangerous to have bobcats playing around your property also why didn t you get animal control perhaps they could go to a wildlife reservation
do they leave any noticable urine marks might want to take that into consideration
this is obviously a bad idea but you should find a way of giving them food and treats and slowly develop a bond with these animals gain their trust and get closer to them amp x b i want to see you in the live feed with her litter in two years time
i m guessing you don t have much of a rodent problem or squirrels rabbits any small animal
it s impossible not to give her the attention she is asking for
where do you live my girlfriend and i would like to come do a cat burglary
i have a russian blue that looks about the same age they are an amazing sweet breed
then stop working and pet her you heartless monster
it s so beautiful i love the red thingy from the thinkpad the cat is cute too
at a glance i thought you said wanking p s don t want near cats they think a worm is playing peekaboo
my dad used to get jealous of how much i used to love our cat he bothered about it till the point i automatically stopped taking care of it so he couldn t wait to kick it out
misread that last word and thought shane dawson posted this
you know they spurs on their rear flippers that are super toxic
is it me or sometimes it s hard to tell wich one is the head and wich one is the tail
that looks more like a man made habitat than a natural one
if it has a bill like a duck webbed feet like a duck lays eggs like a duck it‚Äôs a platypus
what do you mean he is just a regular platypus puts on fedora perry the platypus
creatures like this make be believe in alien intelligence
applicable playtpus names male perry paulie petey percival pedro female penelope patricia paulina patti petra
so platypuses have barb s on their feet that are poisonous and can kill a full grown man
i call this the bellyscratchinator it gives such good belly rubs that all the agents in owaca will be rendered useless so i can take over the whole tri state area
screw swimming with dolphins i wanna go swim with a platypus
i understand now why phineas and ferb loved this creature so much now
great now my girlfriend wants one going to have to hear about this for the next week
aww perry s adorable that is until he pulls out his tail dagger and shanks you did i mention it s envenomed adorable perry
that is awesome i ve seen a few in there real habitat but i have never seen a pet one before they re such a shy creature this is really cool to see
huh i thought they were like times that size don t know why but i ve never thought of them as this small
i ve heard that the venom on the males causes so much pain that people who get bit get put on suicide watch but that s probably just a urban legend
many adorables wants to boop on he qwq d cuz he so cute
the way his leg started kicking like a dog was fantastic
quick reminder platypuses are cute as fuck dont fuck with them
if it‚Äôs a female than that‚Äôs dangerous cos they‚Äôve got poisonous claws on their feet i think
pretty sure his natural habitat isn‚Äôt a pool of animal fondling aussies
is it safe to say that the play instinct is pretty universal among all mammals
apparently only males produce venom and only during their breeding season
you can not deny that this species looks like a pokemon
aren‚Äôt they poisonous how do you keep from getting stung
i m a simple man i see a platypus i upvote doesn t matter that i ve seen this video a thousand times
upvoted cause of cuteness factor i hate platipuses i can t spell for shit fyi
please tell me this is the platypus house in tasmania i was there a year ago
aren t those handlers worried about the poison claws
this is a female no venom barbs also the size is quite a bit smaller than the male this particular platypus is at healesville animal sanctuary you can swim with it for like
‚Äúgosh darn it human put me down i am not a toy‚Äîoh gosh is that me huhuah ‚Äù
how do you get to handle a juvenile beaver for a selfie like that do you work at a wildlife rehabilitation centre i‚Äôm intrigued i hope this isn‚Äôt another case of irresponsible wildlife ‚Äúselfie‚Äù tourism
i couldn‚Äôt tell where the beaver ended and your beard started it‚Äôs kinda like beaverbeard
i d be smiling too if you were that close to my beaver
aww he is so cute although his claws look really sharp
"this is a joy to watch and such a lovely dog you have he looks very mellow i must say your yard look
like my daughters in virginia beach thanks for sharing"
it s the only thing in the house that can keep up with him
i think you may have a new breed of husky do you ever have him fetch stuff in the truck
this is adorable how in the world did you figure out that he‚Äôd like that
"i though he was going to
pull the pallets behind him stromg pupper"
geez with that set up i m sure he s taken a string to the sheath a time or two ouchies
he looks so happy with it maybe i should get one for my dog
modify that truck with one of those push lawn mowers and you have yourself a dog with a job
in my mind when the video started i saw the truck and hand cart as a miniature forklift and was wondering how the dog was going to pull such a heavy load
never seen a dog play with a big truck before and i like it i like it a lot
i so thought the rope was tied to his collar too cute
come trucky truck lets go for a walk i know you love walks i love walks everyone loves walks
hey boy wanna go for a walk naw i mma take the truck
a dog and a dump truck in a backyard there s a metaphor in there somewhere
when oil finally runs out we need to breed super massive dogs to pull our cars
you know that video where the dog‚Äôs owner dresses up as his favourite gumby toy i wonder what this dog reacts like when he sees a real life truck
clever good boy is aware that when he dumps a truck is needed
please reply to my comment to help get rid of an inbox notification thx
dogs and volunteering doesn t really do it for me he was working
what a good boy he played his part in society and earned some rest must‚Äôve been a pleasure to work next to him
i can t be the only one that thought this was a different reggie retiring from the title cute dog
for some reason i clicked the link thinking it would be a picture of reggie from nintendo eating cake although i was pleasantly surprised it was a dog it has left me wondering why i would click the link if i thought it was a picture reggie from nintendo eating cake
imagine what the birds think when they go inside looking for refuge üòÖ
i hope she has a nice life in there she has earned it
if it s a female then its gonna lay eggs in there and soon they are gonna come into ur house amp x b i would evacuate my life if i were u
is that the giant huntsman i think that‚Äôs the giant huntsman
there might be babies to protect in there i d see if you can give your backyard to the army as a muntions testing ground
thanks mr cat when your done come and find me i‚Äôll spoil you
i‚Äôm going to have nightmares about chomping frogs now
could be wrong but i‚Äôve had some experience with bearded dragons it could be a comfort thing some animals nibble at fingers to creat comfort groves when they are growing teeth or the frog equivalent this is probably just it trying to strengthen its grip and its bond no harm apart from maybe a few red marks and if you don‚Äôt wash your hands a minor infection i could be absolutely wrong i know nothing of animals in any professional sense i only know through experience with my own
oh its the young version of that frog from the vore comic oh you‚Äôve seen it you know exactly what i‚Äôm talking about
if this is really a comfort thing thank god we don t meet random people who also do this for comfort lol excluding florida of course
i play it every time someone posts it just to watch my cats trip so angry so cute
noam chompy the philosifrog and political croak tic
pretty sure you re either going to trip balls or ur pregnant
it might have been aaww froggo if it wasn t trying to absolutely mail you
as a ‚Äô asian woman this is how i always assumed giving a black man fellatio would be like
i m not into reptiles or amphibians in this case for exactly this reason if they were bigger or you were smaller they would never ever hesitate to jack your sh t they don t care about you they don t care about anything except eating breeding and murdering
if i m not mistaken this is a white s tree frog these fuckers will literally try to eat anything they would try to eat the sun if it were close enough
try that with a pacman frog let me know how it works out for ya
less of an aww imo but still hysterical just how offended it is at your finger
‚Äúomg omg omg it‚Äôs the biggest worm ever get in my belly ‚Äù
what do you mean the most upvoted post is of a frog
the fight he has trained all his life for and legend foretold of the one who would slay the god worm
this is my reaction to my girlfriend after we re apart for more than a day
someone going to take this and say would you rather have this or this then animate the frog girl from bnha sure kind on someone s finger
frogs don t have teeth i knew this and yet i didn t
dats a helluva worm if i can just figure out how to eats it
you seem to have a little something trying to nom your finger there
looks like my ex girlfriend trying to go down on me ‡≤† Õú ñ‡≤†
he would have much more success if he would bother to evolve teeth first
great thanks for posting about king of monsters without any consideration for those who haven t seen it
getting home from the bar with my gf after a long night out
oh my god i ve caught many frogs in my time and have never had one bite me lol
‚Äúholy fuck that is the biggest worm i‚Äôve ever seen ‚Äù
this the first time i ve seen a reptile here and thought yeah okay that belongs here amp x b amp x b i am aware it s an amphibian
somebody that has a frog explain what the hell it s doing
tell your girlfriend to smuggle this pup out in her pocket i must have her
that moment when you think about all the bad decisions you ve made in your life
is sharing patient information a hippaw violation lol
your gf is going to get in a lot of trouble if the owners find out you guys are posting pics of their pet in hospital and get pissed about it
judging by the other shaved leg they deff blew the other vein therefore it‚Äôs highly likely it wasn‚Äôt just two attempts especially if they tried for the medial cephalic
playing a gif and then reversing it should be a crime
don t think i realised this was a gif for way to long maybe i just didn t care
it reminds me of my cat except my cat is a lot fatter
that s not cute it s awful the way they ve been bred to shorten the legs
the lil‚Äô white kit kat looks like it has a giant now on its head
are they legitimately trying to hurt each other here or are they playing
i m gonna spin my arms round like this if you get in the way it s your ownnnn fault
rock rock paper paper rock rock rock rock oh for crying out loud
don t worry i m sure one of those swings will make paw to paw contact
what kind of cats are these i see these stubby legs all over reddit but have never seen one in rl more importantly are they another example of an abomination like the pug i cant imagine they can defend themselves very well in the wild
thank you for being a superhero and rescuing splinter is extremely cute
i need to ash you a quick question may i have your attention fir a moment dont worry i m pine it s about your cat he is about to become very poplar do you think he can handle the extra attention or do you think he will be like eminem and oak
those eyes how do you get anything done with that level of adorable
did you happen to spot turtles nearby as well they would be years old or so
next thing you know he falls into a mutagenic sludge along with four turtles and teaches them martial arts
little bit of a protruding muzzle tufts of fur all over the ears there is maine coon in that kitten s ancestry somewhere doesn t have the huge paws or overall size for it to be much but there is definitely some adorable as heck
you saved him from a luberyard and named him splinter
i am so mad this isnt event its just jars at the vet
i don‚Äôt see a cat just a wall move along everyone nothing to see here
‚Äúi am not the cotton ball you‚Äôre looking for move along ‚Äù
one time my cat went full it s always sunny mode and got in to the wall there was a wall vent they were doing work on my mom and i were sitting around waiting and talking and turned back and had no clue where jack got to then found him curled up on a pipe inside the wall thankfully there was no way for him to get further back because i m absolutely sure that little asshole would ve gone as far as he could then eventually would ve come back and somehow he d think it was our fault he was stuck in a wall for so long
i cannot see you which must mean that you cannot see me seems logical to me
‚Äúi‚Äôve mastered the ability of standing so incredibly still that i become invisible to the eye
tell me about all the kisses and snuggles talk to me about those fluffy ears
it looks like a dog sample like something that would be used to get approval on dog materials and construction before building the real dog
cute but i have a question what is that pink bump on her front leg
this is why i could never be a vet as soon as she came in i d pick her up say just a minute i ll be right back and then we d be out of the back door and i d run away leaving my job and entire life behind
i never knew that one adult was running in the back row of the group üòçü•∞
wish i could be there to conquackulate them on their journey

if you attempt to hit a single one get ready cause those gooses gonna attack like bees but without the sting
they aren t all their own geese are notorious for stealing others young there was likely a second set of parents the first drove off
from what i saw on nature documentaries geese get territorial and chase off other geese the goslings can‚Äôt fly away with their actual parents so they just end up merging into the other gooses flock so those babies probably include many pairings i doubt they‚Äôre all from those two geese
do geese actually lay that many eggs at one time to be hatched
serious question is that mom and dad do geese behave like that
dude if that ain t the most adorable fucking thing in the world this is the shit that gives me baby fever
he‚Äôs gonna have so much fun hell as a grown ass man i went to some childhood nerd place inside when i visited he will be talking about this for months stoked for this kid and i don‚Äôt even know him can‚Äôt wait til mine are old enough to go
the picture is adorable does grandson of my dad make it then your kid or your nephew
i recommend getting this child kernel space program not only will it make him happy but it may also help him fulfill his dreams
hey i used to work there if you haven‚Äôt already see if you can get the extra ‚Äúlunch with an astronaut‚Äù addition to your ticket not only do you get to talk to and hear stories from a real astronaut but the meal for that is different then all the other ‚Äúfast food‚Äù around the park and is prepared by a real star chef
my wife took me there a few days ago had hours time not long enough i had a few very emotional moments there i just couldn t believe it i was there
the atlantis exhibit is amazing the bus tour out apollo is also great since they give you a ride around the launch pad passing spacex as well as the florida wildlife that gets to roam about possible alligator siting i used to live in the area and this was always my favorite thing to do when i had visitors from out of town the theme parks are nice but nasa is the real thrill of human achievement
i want to know what happened to this kid in years do not fail me
hey i live near there and we go yearly it s very cool make absolutely sure that you take the bus tour it may take a long wait in line but it s included with your ticket and takes you around the rocket assembly building and launch pads it ends with a cool simulation inside the actual mission control of the apollo missions theres so much to see and the moon cafe i m rambling but it s my favorite part
used to be a counselor at space camp titusville and still have two mint condition throttle up books the kids would get for the weeklong program i honestly miss that place
"where he will have sown deep into his sub concsious the utter lie there is an outer space satanic god hating serpent queen nasa and all who knowingly partake in her gross evil
will certainly find themselves standing before god for creating such monstrous lies about his enclosed system comprising a rotating sun and moon and stars and with us his creation below and at the very centre of it all gods earth is fixed and firm and flat ama"
i went there in october and got to finally see a shuttle in person it was so awesome we made it for the opening showing of the shuttle that day and man what an experience
i thought this kid was in a hospital bed and the make a wish foundation visted him then i read the title
aww that is so precious it is wonderful that he has a passion for science at such a young age
that s awesome grandpa rocks my son is i have a hs buddy who is a scientist at the jet propulsion labs in pasadena he invited us for a private tour we live in canada so we spent days in cali i think my son will remember it for the rest of his life and your son s time with his grandpa will be some of his favourite memories well done
that place is awesome i went a few years ago and had a blast and i m in my s
you love space because children dress up like astronauts
i would let that good doggo use an expired coupon for a new ball or treats ‚ò∫Ô∏è
i‚Äôm jealous they don‚Äôt let me bring my dog in at mine
he would like to speak to a manager so that he can compliment you on your impeccable service
usually when people say the cutest it s not this however is
he looks like he popped in for some werther s originals
love it so much when their little ears go back as if to ask something for me
awwww a brittany spaniel they are so cute i miss mine
lol looks like my aunt s dog she has a video of him jumping over the counter in a store just like this one
so today i learned that pup‚Äôs name is ruby and her mom told me to tell y‚Äôall her instagram is rubyisacutie
i love this üòç i would like to make one for each one of my grandchildren do you have a tutorial
it s just impressive piece of work wish i could do this kind of stuff
impressive but i can t stop a niggling feeling that he d rather have a sixpack of beer
hahaha omg i have one almost exactly like this made by my ex i almost didn t have the heart to burn it
how did you make this would like to know how the base was made would love to make something like this for my fianc√© awesome job
i d feel so bad since i d never be able to match the level of care and time put into this i d be paying it all back for the rest of my life
it s like seeing a before and after pokemon evolution
it‚Äôs so funny seeing the body just grow around the eyes
went from ‚Äúpls may i have another‚Äù to ‚Äúi better see extra in that bowl karen‚Äù
this cat is like us all so over life only kitty doesn t have this subreddit to fix their day
lil kitty went from ‚Äúhi please feed me‚Äù to ‚Äú feed me before i murder you in your sleep‚Äù
i can just look at that cats eyes and see that life has really shown it things since being a kitten it looks like a dad that had had enough of its year old jumping on the couch in nd photo
it s like when you start dating a girl so cute and nice to begin with
your girlfriend when she wants something your girlfriend when she s mad
the cat is beautiful to see you you are so sweet and sweet
this cat has seen some stuff since its innocent kittenhood days lol
pokemon og before evolution music plays furly evolves to meoly pokemon og after evolution music plays
this is like when an old character in a disney movie looks at an old photo and wonders where all the innocent magic went
i love how it grew into a fat angry squirrel üòÇ i think the nd pic is more adorable than the st
i can see the tiniest bit of the grump in the baby pic man i love cats
i also have a cat that s name is floyd he was found in a wall
he looks so mean better bring him to my place so i can keep an eye on him
who could throw something so precious away thank you for taking him in people like you restore my faith in humanity
its garbage can not garbage cannot he is going to do great things
i found a cat in the dumpster before we did all we could but he was really sick üò™

plants growing out of a bag of dirt like it‚Äôs a planter a full size shopping cart this patio brought to you by animal crossing home designs
he attecc he protecc but more importantly all paws on decc
my dog does this all the time and i love it they just wanna chill
i hope some one give home a push that was a lot of effort for the small amount of swing he‚Äôs going to get out of it
umm does that dog does that dog have does that dog have pubes
my old fur baby bella used to love sleeping on our porch swing my dad would often leave a pillow on it for her head
don t be so critical just enjoy the puppy dog so cute thanks for sharing
why does said person have a shopping cart at their house lol
stealing shopping carts is the shit they‚Äôre very usefull
and now challenge number getting back off the bench
my old girl loved to sit on our swinging chair eventually she had it all to herself she loved to be swung and would kind of run jump on it to swing herself she would stay on it for hours in the sun i miss her this made me happy thank you
i had a lab that did this the bench swing looked exactly the same because my dog ripped the cushions off and spread cotton everywhere she liked the mesh better haha
i never thought before how difficult those swings would be for a creature without our unusual bending knees
i could be wrong but him getting off might not go as smoothly
is it just me or is the title a dog s pourpose refrence
that reminds me of my parents old dog during the later years of her life she always enjoyed a nice comfy chair
she‚Äôs asking to be drawn like one of your france girl
i m like a chee chee chee chee rony like they make at home or a healthy fish with a big backbone i m abraham de lacy guiseppe casey thomas o malley o malley the alley cat
tumblr isn t as bad as the media thinks this is proof
my anaconda don t want none unless you got snugs hun
i feel an instinctual fear looking at that creature
i really struggle to see any form of indication from snakes that anything is actually going on with them they re either eating something defending themselves going somewhere or not going anywhere i have never seen a snake obviously enjoying anything is that anaconda enjoying those head scritches or does it just not annoy it enough that it is going to try and kill her i can t see any obvious indication aside from the thing not actively trying to kill her
that thing looks like it wants to go for the treat so bad
i thought that said ‚Äúavocado getting head scratches‚Äù
i like that at one point of the video it‚Äôs stretching itself like ‚Äúaw yeah right there‚Äù
must suck to get an itch and realize you don‚Äôt have hands
very friendly anaconda wants to thank you by giving you a big squeeze
snakes are instinctive as in they are programmed to feel hungry and fear they do not feel happy or they do not have love they have no memory only thing they have is a full stomach so they don‚Äôt feel like eating leave that ananconda hungry and it will eat you it‚Äôs not a car or dog
if you scratch a cats chin they usually lift their head just like the snake does
that anaconda don t want none unless you scratch its head hon
i‚Äôve never seen an anaconda interact positively with a human before do they tend to have nasty temperament or do people just not keep them as pets due to their size and food needs
this is literally the top post of all time on this subreddit

i most commonly find toads in my area south central texas and usually after it has been wet for a few days i occasionally stop to pet them but other than that it s wet enough when they re out that i figure they can fend for themselves
they absorb water through their skin hence why it jumped into the water
insect populations are crashing but we need to save the frogs wtf

okay so one time when i was little i saw a frog so being a good samaritan i filled a bucket full of water from a hose and brought it over to the frog it was a hot day and i was going to help i plopped my new friend into the bucket and he didn t seem very happy in fact he seemed to be struggling after a few seconds he stopped he was dead i was shocked and sad i put my hand in the water and it s fucking hot as balls the hose was sitting in the sun and heated up the water i killed this poor frog because i forgot to let new water cool of the heated water
i put my slippers on sunday morning there was a green tree frog in one of them in the house all night where the hell did he come from he was very dry so i put him in a puddle in the backyard
awww my hero frogs are my favorite animal i‚Äôm and have been frog obsessed my whole life üòÇ
i love how he just settles into the bottle cap so cute can tell he enjoys it
it s his like shoogle at the end when he realises he s back in the water that makes it yep this is definitely water time to shoogle that boogle

stop saving frog lives there s thousands of them that make it much more difficult for me to walk barefoot in my yard

i guess i should of added more girlfriend works at a vet clinic and someone came in with this fawn gf was told that they found a dead doe and this fawn close by gf was going to tell her no but found out the lady was feeding it maple syrup so she said she would take it because obviously the lady wasn‚Äôt taking the correct care of it we are going to call fish and wildlife today and see what they say to do

‚Äúhmm where was my dog again god he blends in perfectly ‚Äù
that s shopped btw the reflective light would be just as bright on his nose moisture and edges in the sealed concrete floor get a beautiful little black pooper pull photo in photoshop duplicate layer adjust saturation to brightness to add layer mask and mask eyes boost contrast on original photo ask yourself why you are editing a photo instead of rolling on floor with pooper
those eyes tho like seriously that pup has the prettiest damn eyes i have ever seen
magnificent someone write it in those huge fonts please
wow its almost like the cute grey dog picture that s posted here every week was photoshopped to make it seem original
that is some extreme dedication to maintaining a consistent dark theme
she does except for the shine in her eyes she s a beauty
this pic made my day black z puppy i love it its so cute
she does except for those magnificent blue eyes now you pick her up and give her the petting and love she needs and deserves
that is why our black lab had a red collar she would ‚Äúdisappear‚Äù in poorly lit areas but we‚Äôd see that red collar
posted for the th time cute for the th time but the first i‚Äôve seen it so badly photoshopped
this is my first seen reddit post ty for introducing reddit to me üòò
beautiful but also a little scary i m feeling both aww and ahhh
is this photoshop the picture is so perfect she s so cute
the editing in this feels as if it intentionally portrays a black dog puppy watching over from the ceiling a pediatric ward
is this outside or are your floors concrete cute pupper tho
you know what blends in a black dog named midnight who got out the house at midnight and since we had no street lights we couldn t see him we had to shuffle through our front and back yard for an hr calling his name until we found him didn t help he had some hearing issues soo much poop had been touched and stepped on that night
that is an extremely handsome floor thanks for sharing
this dog will steal your soul and your so without missing a beat
that puppy is nowhere near blending in with the background
it s a white walker get some dragonglass shit there s the night king where s arya jons out there fuckkng around with the dragon and a few wights almost took out drogon snap back to reality woop there goes gravity
i was in a shitty mood until i came across this puppers and now i forgot that i had a shitty mood ü§î
this might be the most photogenic puppy i have ever seen
why are we promoting unattainable standards for dogs
how is this majestic animal standing on the ceiling
my cat is like this he has black fur and it‚Äôs almost impossible to take pictures of him he blends in with everything
i just made a noise that i m not entirely sure is human she is so cute it hurts aaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwww please cuddle her for me
those eyes are staring into my soul what a beautiful puppy this also looks like a black and white photo with the eyes being edited to look more vibrant than they are not saying it is
puppies turning into wights is something i never thought i wanted to see
furian puppers better keep him away from necromongers
if i end up with a fat cat i m gonna name them count chonkula
oh man your kitty looks so happy for being at the vet my wife and i do the same thing when we take our cats to the vet but they are way grumpier also wifelady likes your tatoo

holding a cat like that can cause injuries to their ligaments and muscles

this is the third time in two weeks this has been reposted
it‚Äôs so easy to see when a pitt is happy god i love them so much
‚Äòaww‚Äô does not begin to describe the noise i just made
vet tech here super cute would advise taking that dog to the vet though by his reaction when the cat gets close to his right ear i d say it s probably inflamed and needs treatment
i m saving this so i can watch again and again times so far
i think this is the first post from this sub that i said ‚Äúawww‚Äù out loud like just look at the at face that dog makes just melts my heart
they both sad that they are watching a cowboys game
aww look at him smile and wag his tail he loves his little friend d
i low key thought that the cat was licking the dog s eye wtf is wrong with me
this is why i love pitbullies they don t care who loves them as long as they get loves lol
is this love is this love is this love is this love that i‚Äôm feelin
when your cat is a dumb eagles fan but the dog is a smart boi and goes for the cowboys
awwww he so appreciates the cat‚Äôs affection and approval
ahhh reminds me of the cute pit on my mail route he crashed thru the screen door and pinned me up against the car thankfully the owner called him off at the last second but a month later he got out again little scoundrel i wasn‚Äôt around but the neighbors german shepherd husky and cute tabby cat were both outside he killed them both and when i asked another neighbor what happened they said it was over before it started shepard mix was tossed around like a rag doll and they would not tell me what zeus the cute pittie did to the cat ahhh memories i bid off that route the next chance i got because of the other cute pitties on that route that were equally as friendly say what you want about it‚Äôs the owner not the breed but if i trained my pug or brussels griffon to attack and kill you try as they may i doubt highly that they could sorry if you ever had the experience i had you would shit yourself with every encounter good or bad that is a fact sorry i still do not trust the owner of that breed
reddit when a dog looks like it s smiling and ears are back this means the dog is stressed or on edge this is not cute also reddit awww look how cute this is it s exactly the same but a cat is involved
that fella is loving those licks pure happiness from that smile
automatic upvote for the beautiful ears he a good boy
i don‚Äôt care how many times this gets reposted it‚Äôs my favorite eye bleach video of all time
where s the chomp i always thought it was licklicklickchomp
usually my cat swipes at my dog but his tail still wags tho
don t make any sudden movements or noises when it s doing that it might rip out your cat s throat
reposted so many times but this is still the best üòä
cant believe they re gonna pay dak trade up jerry trade dak and a first rounder for dwayne haskins boom
i got my pittie girl a new kitten last night lol she is over the moon right now the two grown cats are not quite as excited about the prospect though
i showed this to my girlfriend and she started crying

the colouration is caused by a condition called vitiligo where the person or in this case animal loses pigmentation
not sure what s up with the title but this cat s name is elli and you can find more at elli vitiligo on instagerm
i don t know why but this cat looks like the cat to pay if you need someone to disappear
my cat would have had its butt hole in everyone‚Äôs faces twice over by this point
will probably get downvoted but i really thought that the fur coat was the cat the kitten is s sleeping ball of cuteness though
workplace stress buster dagger clawed beast and cuteness all in one bundle of fluff that s efficiency
uh yea i sure hope it counts trash baby is still baby
take care of it and you ve got a friend for life crows are smart little buggers
thats really cool you know i can honestly say ive never seen a baby crow before this or a baby seagull for that matter wtf
ive been talking to and giving seeds and stuff to the crows nearby my work i see the same three all over the place now the biggest one was walking over to me last time all friendly and i was hoping this would be the moment he jumped up on to my hands but a car drove by and it got spooked
that‚Äôs a raven not a crow the easiest way to tell the difference is to look at their heads crows have smaller rounder heads and slightly more delicate necks and beaks while ravens have thicc necks and big ass beaks and a prominent brow ridge and generally look bulkier
that crow will sing your praises and pass on your legend to its babies
oh my old dog maggie used to love plastic bottle even as a puppy it wasn‚Äôt just a water bottle it was plastic gallon milk containers and liter bottles of soda she looked absolutely ridiculous because they were like times her size lol she was an amazing doggo i miss her so much
my boss used to put a water bottle with a few pebbles in it inside a sock and sew it up her cockerspaniels would nuts for it
the goodest of bois give him extra belly scratches from this internet stranger
please don t recycle him he s so cute don t you want to keep him i ll take him if you don t want him anymore
i can‚Äôt handle how cute this puppy is like i had to look in small increments of time and take breaks because the cuteness was overwhelming
no matter how expensive the toy you buy them is they are just as happy playing with an empty soda bottle
after many years of daily marijuana research i can confirm that s a homemade bong a steamroller if you will as it s known in weed culture knew my research would pay dividends someday
looks at calendar welp i didn‚Äôt plan on kidnapping a beautiful environmentally conscious puppy today but here we are ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
this is a repost this is a female stop posting shit that is not your content for the points you are welcome for riley
looks like that used to be a bong can see the rush hole lol
i don‚Äôt care if i‚Äôve seen this a thousand times i still love it every time
yo just a heads up to anyone that give their dog a plastic bottle to play with make sure to also remove the plastic ring from the top of the bottle
i love that you can see his little tounge through the bottle
throw a few pennies in there and you ll never need to buy a dog toy throw it in the recycling bin after and put the pennies in a new one
you may live to regret using recycles as toys i know i did with my golden but no doubt about how cute this one is love it
i used to have a dog who loved to kill empty two liter soda bottles if you left one empty on the counter she d bark at it and look at you in great offense that you hadn t given it to her never the full ones or the almost empty ones just the empty ones she also liked to have the cap tightly on so she could pop it with her mighty jaws actually she was pounds of tiny badass and destroyed many a bottle rip shiva
what you ve caught here is a covert stealth doggo relaying messages to central command via tactical birbmail
i thought that bird was a miniature dead sheep s head
the bird looks like it s mining for some green gold
is that a wild bird cuz man it has watermelon sized balls if it is
do be careful don t ever let a cat or dog touch noses or lick a bird they carry pasteurella multocida which can be deadly to birbos üòû
i used to hold my pet hamster next to my buttocks just to fart on his furry face good times
lol i love animals with people names i once knew a dog named greg üòè he was so cool üòé lol
looks like tony is nibbling at everyone s hearts ‚ù§Ô∏è
awww tony you re so handsome i miss all my ratties stupid short rodent lifespans
hate to be the guy but no no i‚Äôll leave it shitty parenting alert
one of the least aww things i think i ve ever seen it seems like the dog is showing so much restraint
somebody needs to raise that kid properly and give those parents a good slapping around poor dog
not sure if this is just regular playing but it sure ain t look like it if the child is pissing off that dog for real it s giving out clear red flags and that just supports my point that no dog deliberately ever bit a child
this is anything but ‚Äúaww‚Äù get your crotch goblin to stop annoying the dog
that dog is giving major red flags what kind of madness is this dogs can t deal with this shit for ever they snap like we do but when a dog snaps it gets put down it can t defent itself and that is the only way to express the fact that this is uncomfortable kudos to the dog for putting up with your shit op
that‚Äôs an accident waiting to happen bitch that dog is get mad enough where it‚Äôll bite the hell out of the kid and babies as small as they are can actually hurt dogs my niece was about this age when she would grab my dogs leg or anything she could reach and dig her little fingers in it‚Äôs obvious it hurts the dog you suck because you‚Äôre letting the dog bite this baby who doesn‚Äôt know any better injuries incoming and you‚Äôre letting the baby hurt the dog or possibly hurt the dog this isn‚Äôt ‚Äúaww how cute‚Äù it‚Äôs ‚Äúaw what an idiot‚Äù
there‚Äôs a good chance that one of these days that kid is actually going to get bit and then the dog and the kid suffers
the dog is warning the baby to back off that s not fun for the dog u should not have kids or animals if u think this is ok ü§¨
my nephew does this all the damn time irregardless of how many times he gets bit doing so also keep your kid away from that dog yo bad shit happens there i have experience with this
important to note that even if this dog would never do any harm to a child if this child does this to his dog he may wander up and grab a strangers dog that dog will rip his arm off and you‚Äôll demand they put him down it‚Äôs no ones dogs fault if you taught your toddler that grabbing a dog is acceptable and that a dog showing and threatening teeth which is what this is duh is funny and cute you‚Äôre destined for failure
if you re going to have pets around babies you use every opportunity to teach that little snot factory to be gentle and respect other beings you do not let your crotch goblin pester and torment a dog who is likely trained to be gentle with people as this dog is as i m not seeing them actually clamp down with their teeth when they get the monster s hand in their mouths because even a highly well trained dog has a mental limit on what they can handle and they will defend themselves and you will see that defensive action as aggression towards your little hellspawn and blame and punish the dog you should not be allowed to have animals or children
i think op got the hint we hate this video lol they deleted their account in all seriousness tho i wish that dog and the baby well
land seal reminds me of labrador when she s begging for food daisy deserves all the pets
i had a daisy who looked very similar she was a good girl yay you

he‚Äôs adorable looks young did you rescue him as a baby i would love to have a raccoon
good luck with you skin and your personal items your pantry
good on you for saving this little guy s life but have you made sure that keeping a wild animal is legal where you live btw i ve rehabilated wild raccoons at a wildlife rehab center before and once these guys reach puberty oh boy you ll be in for some chaos i m saying i highly discourage keeping raccoons as pets
he looks so small cute and adorable hope he had a nice meal üíô
for some reason i never pictured them growing this way
after a rain or dew in the morning look in the palms for baby frogs
pineapples are especially beautiful i love bromeliads
pineapples are so weird they re the only fruiting bromeliad we know of
because plants aren‚Äôt cute and don‚Äôt have an infant form
awww so cute well i guess it would matter if u see a mama bear charging at you vs a mama dog üòÇüòÇ
if it was a baby bear you wouldn‚Äôt be alive to write about it
yeah i‚Äôd risk having my arm ripped off by a mama bear to pet this lil cutie
"i just gave pets and it felt so good
a critter let me rub its floof all over
i just gave pets and i ll never go back
cuz it feels the best when you give a scritch i cried the whole time
doesn t matter gave pets
dog or a bear
doesn t matter gave pets
could have been a wolverine
still counts i just gave pets and it felt so good"
like metaphorical pets because i ve had this picture on my phone for like two years
awwwwwwwwwwwww he is so cute he looks so much like a bear cub
looks like a bear if you dont know what a bear looks like
i‚Äôve seen this posted so many times but it never gets old
there was a version of this set to the happiest bounciest music i‚Äôve ever heard and the dog‚Äôs footsteps matched up perfectly to the beat does anyone know what it was
reminds me of this song imagine me and you i do i think about you day and night it s only right to think about the girl you love and hold her tight so happy together i can t see me lovin nobody but you for all my life when you re with me baby the skies ll be blue for all my life

hi we are in the neighborhood spreading the word of jehovah
i haven t had a kitten in years i tend to adopt older cats or strays who won t leave but i really want a hoodie with a smol kitten in the big pocket like these kittens in the picture
think about exploring the world out in the sun with your buddy and then the two of you encounter this massive cave opening i‚Äôm talking skyscraper height and it‚Äôs guarded by some weird impenetrable force that you can climb and your hands can get stuck to but otherwise can‚Äôt cross but you can see through it and in the endless dark of the cave you hear a noise and can make out a shape and it‚Äôs getting closer and it walks right up to the entrance of the cave and it‚Äôs a living creature almost as high as the entrance itself and it lowers its gigantic furry head alllll the way down to your head and looks and you and says ‚Äú
he she looks like a grandma trying to get a better look at a baby
oh i love it when kittens are kinda bunched up like that the proportions are really cuuuuute also this is a very lovely photo like well composed and good colors when you look at it on it s own
thought the dog head was a monster at first for some reason
kittens trick or treating for cat treats halloween zootopia
something about kittens and big dogs my month old kitten terrifies my friends full grown pit boxer mix and she knows it
i don t blame the dog for being scared kitten teeth and claws are like tiny knives i have two adult cats that i think are tiny they are both only like lbs so seeing these two like this seems impossibly tiny i love them and want to give them lots of treats and head rubs
i remember watching a cow being chased by kittens and it was so scared it shat itself üòÇ
given the color of his fur and shape of his muzzle please tell me his name is falcor p
those two cats look exactly like two of mine but mine are older
no you can t come in no you can t have my food no you can t play with my toys no you can t share my human no you can t sleep in my bed fine we can cuddle but that s the last straw
that dog is actually a predator praying on children
when the politicians are at your door asking for your vote
heart explodes what kind of dog is that i love how bigger dogs are always the most gentle with little kittens it makes my soul happy
i love pictures from behind of kittens sitting down and looking up
i really wanted my kitten to get past the kitten size so i wouldn t keep stepping on them and now i wish i could look upon their smallness all the time
‚Äúdid you two kittens ever hear the tragedy of darth plagueis the wise ‚Äù
let me tell you a story of the golden days little guys
that s an old dog huh everyone else says he looks sad me i just think he looks old
this is a disney movie about the two kittens on an adventure and they stop by this old timers house for life advice
those cats look like ones my cousins used to have except smol
this looks like something out of a disney movie like the two kitties are the protagonists and they ve gone to the dog for some kind of advice
science doggo discovers new life forms perhaps future experiments will include snuggles üê∂‚ù§Ô∏èüê±

i hope he has a voice like a big scared guy with a squeaky voice
lol i have a gentle lovable black lab and recently brought home two small kittens she just wants to play with them but she‚Äôs so big and strong she will literally punch them across the with her snout in a little while they will be big enough to set the proper limit but it‚Äôs funny to watch them interact the lab is super jealous of the attention the kittens get too
that‚Äôs exactly the kind of vet i want taking care of my pet someone who loves animals
this is the best kind of vet she can come across cold to me all she wants as long as my cats get treated like this üòÇ
and veterinary technicians also extraordinary individuals‚Ä¶
i wanna know more about the friendly curious kitty in the beginning
as a veterinarian i can tell you this is soooo true lol
"i don t mind the occasional repost but i do tend to get annoyed when i ve seen it thirty time in the last month
perhaps a slight exaggeration but not that much"
good thing to know that my dog would be in good hands
my friend has been trying to find a shared apartment for the last few weeks and couldn t seem to find one she liked she had sent me a description of the one she went to see yesterday and nothing stood out about it so i was surprised when she said she d taken it i asked her what made her choose it and she sent me this picture i understand completely now
that looks a lot like the pictures featured on today s weratedogs post their names are boris and doug and they have their own instagram page
remember never get two puppies at once if you can avoid it google litter mate syndrome
dogs with one blue eye can see in to sprit world in native american mythology
i want to cuddle and kiss her mouth sorry don t mean to be creepy

what is this white stuff my atlanta based dog asks in degree weather
i mean does it get any more majestic then this the answer is no no if doesn‚Äôt
where s his tail what did you do to the lord of winterfell
there sits the only king i mean¬†to bend my knee to the¬†king¬†in the north
pretty sure the dogs were attacking the cat not saving it
it is amazing how selfless dogs are the love they have is infinite
last time this was posted it was pointed out that the dog was almost certainly pushed very sad to see
feel like i need to be reminded there is a guy fucking filming this shit
super cute but what happens to the cat after the other dog goes after it
humans and now cats don‚Äôt deserve dogs they‚Äôre so pure of heart
the dog was pushed in the water no doubt by a human anything for seconds of fame and for the awww angry face
we live in an age where getting that perfect video vs putting down the phone and helping matters more
does the dog pick up a stick to pull him in at first
i don t think it was trying to hit him it looked to me like it was just trying to grab onto something solid and didn t want to actually hurt the dog
ah good point well at least the good boy gets out in the end
this is animal cruelty this was proven to be staged the owner threw the cat in the water then pushed the dog in for views on the interwebs this is not an awww mom
may you find kibble with built in gravy wherever you go

i wish you got a good one none of mine have ever done this
given time they will sit however they please they also have an innate knowledge of human anatomy especially where a full bladder is located when the human wishes to sleep in
only the special ones and by that i mean especially adorable ‚ù§Ô∏è
over time they will learn how to sit like a human coach potato too
pretty normal just wait until they start shadow boxing the ghosts in your house
that s the mid licking pose for my cat he usually has a glance at the tv while licking his own backside
yes and other variety of limbering positions you will see and be impressed
no you‚Äôve got a defective cat i will take it off your hands though
my cat sits like that when she‚Äôs in the middle of licking her arsehole and something catches her attention like a bird in the garden
yes this is the i m about to lick my butthole pose quite elegant
was expecting herv√© villechaize was not disappointed regardless
everything to see here an adorable frenchie enjoying his pineapple
smart doggo made sure the pineapple doesn t get sandy
this dog is living a life better than most humans right now
not a care in the world not a minute to waste the time is now relax enjoy let go of the chase
oh he‚Äôs enjoying that so much so that you can see the joy on his face
i‚Äôll always upvote this no matter how many times it‚Äôs posted first time i saw it made my day cheerful and i hope it does the same for you today
i realized i never saw a dog eat with his paws before
i love french bulls so much they are just the cutest
akshually this is baaad because when u feed dogs pineapples while they are submerged in sand it makes them so cool it turns them into poochie from the simpsons and risks killing them on their way to their home planet
this makes me so happy pure little spirit livin in his her joyous moment
he s living the best life right now saved to my folder of cute doggies
i can only wish to experience this kind of relaxation
stop it with the cute little dogs i cant take it anymore
my heart is so full of love for today‚Äôs posts i think i‚Äôm going to explode
sad that people continue to support this breed and others like it
he needs a sun lounger and a sun hat placed at a jaunty angle
my only hope is it doesn t drop into the sand and still eat it
there was something off about this it wasnt that the dog was eating with its paws it was that the dog was taking its time small bites if this was my dog he d try to inhale the entire sammitch in one of two bites
to be fair this is also exactly how i eat pineapple
i don‚Äôt know why this strongly reminds me of my toothless grandmother eating something down to the expression
i literally think he was trained to eat this way for viral videos still cute af tho
it‚Äôs sooooooooooo fucking cuuuuuuuuuuuute and with its paws üêæ ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è üòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòç
i love that he‚Äôs actually enjoying it with small bites licks my golden would‚Äôve inhaled the whole thing in seconds flat
some very weird humans buried their very weird dog and made a movie out of it i can deal with it
never have i seen anyone live their best life better than this pup
is the potential for dropping pineapple in the sand stressing anyone else out or is it just me
my english bulldog ate a piece of pineapple once and i woke up to spray diarrhea everywhere
i thought he was eating a dead snake the way the rope looked
nothing to see this dog is clearly also playing a sand monster
i didn t realize that he is in sand and fully thought i was tripping out
i hope he doesn t drop it pineapple would get very sandy he would be sad
oh my god i can t even tell you how badly i needed to see something this pure and sweet right now
you ever just at the beach and when you eat a sandwich there‚Äôs a s it ton of sand
i think we decided that was a twinkie on the last repost of this
you should be careful with short snouted dogs like that eating especially so if they re on their backs there is a reason people don t generally eat laying flat secondly i cant count how many times my family had to stick their hand down our english bulldogs throats because they were choking on food
cute pup i want a frenchie so bad but the suffering they go through due to the genetic modifications they have undergone is so sad i just can‚Äôt justify supporting that market
took me forever to figure out what i was looking at didn‚Äôt realize he was half buried and thought it was a weird foreshortening effect
hmm omnonom lick monch monch this is some good shit lick
i ve seen at least four videos of this dog eating different foods while in this position do they enjoy this it looks like it could be a choking hazard
gt nothing to see here gt a frenchie enjoying his pineapple you should never combine those two
baby frenchies make the best noises i realize this isn t a baby just saying
til dogs can actually eat things without trying to shove the entire item down their throats
for some reason the thumbnail looked like it was a rat killing a snake
when the interviewer asks ‚Äúwhere do you see yourself in years ‚Äù
i ve never seen a dog eating a pineapple my life is now fulfilled
a frenchie beach pineapple what could be more romantic
weird i just saw this a week ago with a different headline
when people ask me what goals do i have for my life this is the image that plays in my head
i‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs actually a monkey in its weredog form
not a care in the world just a pup and his pineapple
holy shit this is as awesome now as it was when it was posted earlier this week
i fear he drops the pineapple and continues to eat the sandy pineapple
i was like ‚Äú wish he blends in ‚Äù but no he‚Äôs just covered in sand
frenchie the beholder of sand pineapples special attack sand spin causes dmg blindness and annoyance
i can‚Äôt watch this without the thought of how much sand he is eating
all i see is sand why is the pineapple disappearing
he blends into the ground and looks like legion where lenny is in the wall at clockworks
this is why dogs are so loyal to humans what other animal gets to take a vacation to the beach and eat pineapple that someone else peeled for it
i need puppy i need beach i need pineapple please you share perfect moment thanks üêæ
frenchies have such more unique personalities than any other dog breed imo
did anyone else think the sand was his belly for a moment
i wonder if they would all eat pineapple i ve always had dachshunds and they love bananas so much so that they ll steal them from you if you aren t careful god forbid you lean over holding a banana or try to eat a banana while you carry the pupper if you do it s as good as gone
even though he doesn t have poseable thumbs he ll still hold things lmao
this is peak internet we‚Äôre living in the golden age
i‚Äôm surprised he‚Äôs taking bites mine woulda shoved the whole thing in her mouth and proceeded to choke herself and yak away for the next minutes
this clip is years old and this particular dog was hospitalized and nearly died because their owner fed it all kinds of terrible shit in terrible positions like this for the gram
where does he stand on the pineapple pizza controversy i m guessing he s in favor of it
i relate to this dog the munch munch munch motion is definitely relatable
who seriously uses a rope that thick for a tiny dog what an a hole
i used to have a frenchie best dog i ever had all my dogs are great but this one had the craziest most funny and enjoyable personality plus he loved getting stoned if i was smoking he would run in jump in my lap and inhale the excess smoke probably bad for him but he would get high be very playful eat all his kibble then pass out watching tv with me it was great
i always thought otters were my spirit animal but this little guy has me questioning all i thought i knew
frenchies are surprisingly intelligent i thought it was pretty much shiba inus that know how to use their paws for things but til frenchies know how to as well
did anyone else start thinking about how after seeing this videos if dogs were left to evolve and became intelligent enough to make civilizations then instead of sitting and using hands to do stuff like humans would all their contraptions be operated on there back like car seats would be little dents that they lay in and look up at their ‚Äúwindow‚Äù and use their paws or just me
like the dog isn t even scarfing it down just enjoying every bite
very glad to see this pup is okay he had quite the health scare a while back and it did not look good had to unfollow the ig account cuz it was heartbreaking glad to see he‚Äôs back to his old ways
am i the only triggered by the sand possibly getting on the pineapple
it took me a solid seconds of ‚Äúwhere is his torso to realise he‚Äôs laying in sand
i‚Äôll be doing this at the beach in a couple of months
is it weird that i thought this was somehow a dog severed in half eating its own intestines yeah probably
a frenchie and sand i see the work of an enemy stand here
the dog is in sand it took me a second to realise the dog was not in fact crazy well camouflaged i am not a smart man
i love how when his arms reach for his face his back legs reach too
no one freaking cause he is eating pineapple or just my old self
some day the smol pupper with give the big pupper a run for its money
he looks like a dead on their feet parent holding a toy for their kid like he s napping with his eyes open
is he actually playing or has a person stuck it in his mouth because he looks kind of stressed
my parents dog did this with mine when he was a puppy it was so cute my pound puppy would tug like crazy and my parents pound dog would just stand there or very gently pull back when mine grew up they had some crazy tug matches though
i was always leery of dobermans until my boss got two of them bumbliest animals ever and i love them
that s not patience it s the face of the tug of war championship belt holder defending his position
he s not being patient if anything you can tell he s slightly annoyed he isn t getting the tug of war play fight he wanted
a friend of my wife got a new puppy about a year ago and she brought her over to meet our dog who was about ish at the time he spent the whole time teaching her tug o war it was adorable when she d drop the toy he d move it back over to her and make sure she picked it up and only tug verrry lightly now that she s bigger they play a little rougher but i think he still lets her win haha
i have seen like doberman in real life i know they exists but why does noone own one it s like pitbulls are free and everyone has a lab or chihuahua i even see a decent number of frenchies but dobermans almost seem like an urban legend maybe they are difficult to own because they re aggressive
looks more like he s in his tug of war position and doesn t realize that this is all the tug the little guy has
well ‚Äòdober‚Äô means ‚Äúkind‚Äù in russian and ‚Äòman‚Äô you know the meaning of so it‚Äôs literally ‚Äúkind person‚Äù so what do you expect
i have a doberman i got a gsd puppy and he just constantly tried to hump her the first day she was here nd day the same i broke down crying thinking what have i got myself into he stopped then but still tries to every so often but she nearly as big as him now and puts him in his place got her fixed def didn‚Äôt want a mix of puppies around
dead tired but knows chubby baby woofers needs play damn hero
best dogs ever my doberman was so gentle she loved kittens especially
little pup is thinking he is super strong moving his dads head like that üòç
me waiting for my classmate to finish their hilarious story that they laughed of so it took extra minutes off my lifespan
doberman are a breed of extraordinary intelligence it doesn t surprise me in the slightest that this one is happily playing along with the pup
i thought it was illegal to have their ears cropped
im a doberman pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage pupil
that terrier will always be smaller than it‚Äôs doberman friend huge but beautiful dogs
this is my rottweiler lab with my new french bulldog my frenchie tries so hard to get the toy from the bigger dog but can t do anything
when you re max level and you re newbie friend wants to v
u pm me steam k ys that username ever worked out for you yet
just waiting for some real competition from the new kid
where is the guy that makes doggo poems out of all of these
i love dobbies such good dogs that hair though they are like little needles that get into everything
absolutely adorable but can we stop cutting off dog s ears
this is the doge equivalent of investing in your future soon he will have a full time trained tug of war com padre
saw this gif an hour ago and thought it was a kitten last time
she‚Äôs a great mom the pup may not be hers but she treats him that way what a majestic doberman btw
the pupper is like enjoy the title while you can imma get big and tug you around in about months
this hits close to home i have a pretty large dog and my new puppy loves to play with him my big dog just sits and lets the pup tug at any toy he has
i have mastered the ability of standing so incredibly still that i become invisible to the eye
i hate when people post these could you draw a circle around it or something
if you re going to post a picture of an invisible fawn at least outline where it should be jeez
pretty sure he isn t doing much thinking at all haha
i‚Äôm guessing john arena is also in this picture because i can‚Äôt see either
don t know what you re talking about it s obviously just a pic of asphalt road
like this is the content i subscribed for not some random pictures of your dog if you take a pic of your dog make sure it is at least interesting and not just awww look at this good boy
can someone tell me where the fawn is i ve been staring at this photo for twenty minutes and i just don t see it
he‚Äôs mastered the art of staying so incredibly still that he‚Äôs invisible to the eye
my cat used to do that he d hunker down in the middle of the bed hiding out in the open
eyyy future coyote chow oh come on if his mom s dumb enough to try and hide him in the middle of the road you know you darwin s gonna prevail
the fawn forgot to set the grass settings to minimum
lol mule deer or blacktail can t see the ass end for accurate id and their gigantic ears are amusing
if i get down low enough they won t be able to see me
i don t know what you re talking about i see no fawn just pavement
dear are dumb as posts you know the expression ‚Äú like a deer caught in the headlights ‚Äù there‚Äôs a reason for it
is he in the road silly dawn needs a slightly safer hiding spot
um dude are you on shrooms it s just a photo of a road
it s obvious to us because our eyes see a large spectrum of colors most predators don t we are also better at spotting an unmoving target on the other hand we are not very good with things that move fast or in the dark
adopts fawn i will call him dan doesn t seem fitting for a fawn with your talents of camouflage we will enlist him and promote him immediately to lieutenant
i don t see any fawn here but if i did i would say he is such a good boi woooow but this is just some blank asphalt soo
actually he she is just instinctively taking that position because most of the time they would be nearly invisible darwin was a smart mofo
don t you think it s a bit presumptuous to say what he s thinking then again maybe you do know what he s thinking and i m actually the one being presumptuous by presuming the presumption
his ears are slightly curled which unfortunately means he s been without food and water for a couple days it s possible his mother has died ears are straight fawn is doing great ears are curled fawn is alone in the world
are you sure he can move i know fawns have limited mobility when they‚Äôre young
ugh poor little guy i know that you shouldn t ever disturb a fawn where it is hiding but when it s hiding like this you just know something bad will probably happen and it s so tempting to just gather up the poor thing and carry it home and lay it down on a soft rug somewhere inside and turn down the lights and light a few candles and pour a couple of glasses of wine and softly play a little barry white in the background and hand feed it some strawberries while softly whispering why hello bambi you can call me flower if you want to
i find this really depressing this little guy is trying to use instinctive strategies to hide from predators but it doesn t work in a world that s paved over
in the dead leaves in the forest his natural environment he is pretty much invisible what time is the woods i bent down to tie my boots and three feet from me there was a fawn
he has mastered the art of standing so incredibly still he is invisible
good luck settling in monty your new owner understands you might need a little help understanding what to do and how to act around humans so just relax and enjoy being loved and accepted welcome home adorable boy
monty one eye sooo cute thank u for providing a forever home for him
he got returned because they knew monty was destined for you i know it s schmaltz but it makes me feel better i gave up a cat to a friend because i know that cat would have a better life there then with me
very unique and beautiful marking congratulations on the new family member
my best friend‚Äôs pup was returned twice before they found her both times it was because ‚Äúshe‚Äôs too hard to train ‚Äù they haven‚Äôt had any issues beyond some minor separation anxiety when she was still young she‚Äôs a friggin boxer mix were they expecting a low key impeccably polite dog right out of the box that‚Äôs not how boxers work she does need a fair amount of exercise but my friend runs a dog boarding service so she gets new friends to go crazy with almost every day so ultimately at least much like your pup she found her way to the right home
you re a good boy monty have you new human give you a treat from me
his right eye makes him look like a cyborg which is awesome
his little eye patch is super cute but it s his nose that slays me so adorable
can i like subscribe to monty i need to see this good boi and thank you this pup is about to have a wonderful life hooman
oh my goodness so freaking adorable i wonder if his ears will stay like that our dog had ears almost identical to his when she was a puppy but as she got older they went straight up she had a few surgeries on her leg at wsu and the vets said they tried so hard to keep her ears floppy but they had a mind of their own hahah she is a german shepherd pitbull husky wolf mix and so darn cute no matter what type of ears she has
that title is was a roller coaster of emotions glad he found his forever home
my dog who passed in november was named monty he was a big playful lovable mutt he got me through a lot of tough times by just being happy to see me whenever i came home i hope you guys get to share a wonderful loving bond team monty
monty is adorable and i am glad you found your best friend

the kitty heard in tempo bop the cam bop the cam bop the cam bop the cam
‚Äúoh you are doing something here let me knock some shit over for you ‚Äù cat most likely
i love how your cat just immediately decided that filming yourself was not happening today the cat is clearly the star
i heard this tune before in a movie i think it was apart of the twilight series
self taught or taking lessons i know it‚Äôs not really the point of the video i‚Äôm just interested in learning too
why does she spends so much time petting that shiny rectangle with her thumb it only purrs for like of a second and it probably can t even land upright if it falls for sure it can t land upright if it falls she probably thinks it could land upright she loves when i land upright and she spends like hours a day with this stupid rectangle over me i should just show her how stupidly it falls slam yup i knew it terrible balance too i barely touched it
‚Äúyou will do no such thing while i‚Äôm around‚Äù every car ever
i like how kitteh stares at you while you set up the camera then shakes its head and gets up like nah i gotta take a closer look at this
found this on misleadingthumbnails thought it would belong here
whan the first chair pile is too tall so you start another
stacked up really nicely it looks like the bottom left is wearing a hat with a hat with a hat of its head
if this symbolized human interaction i would be the one on the left side
why is this photo on the front page every day rule should apply
those fake foxes look like a stack of negative traffic cones
is your puppy related to drax standing so still hes invisible
tf do you mean look closely the dog is in the middle of the fucking screen your dog is shit at hide and go seek and you re legally blind
i can t find him can you post a follow up with an arrow
he‚Äôs living out his dream of being a spider do you see the web he‚Äôs creating
i think you better circle where he‚Äôs at üòÇ beautiful newf we had a couple when i was a kid great breed of dog fun to take swimming too
that drool from the brick to his jowl ü§£ he s too cute
sir or mam this isn t a place for pictures of walls

thunder maybe or a teeny tiny firecracker this could have been my dog

congratulations to both you and mom i hope they all grow up to to be big and strong
is that a belgian malinois our good girl had pups on our wedding night years ago girls and boys we kept damn those puppies were house wreckers though but it was worth it congrats they are adorable
i can t tell if mom is super happy or feeling just a little crazy she s beautiful though and so are the puppers
precious i love their sweet little rainbow collars congrats
you should spay and neuter your dog enough puppies around
congratulations you ve sure got your hands full the world needs more dedicated breeders like you
your mal is so beautiful i‚Äôm absolutely fascinated by this breed i have a malinois german shorthaired pointer with the maligator mouth and i just sit there in awe watching him casually destroying bones and chew toys don‚Äôt even get me started on the speed agility and boundless energy haha congratulations on a safe delivery of many adorable baby gators
wasn t this posted on reddit a while ago i seem to recall those different coloured pup collars but it may have just been a different momma coincidence
such a proud mama they are absolutely adorable malanois are such stunning dogs ‚ù§
thank you they are wonderful dogs so long as you keep them busy
no the world needs more responsible dog owners good job on teaching others what a responsible pet owner should do being a family of le we know the meaning of quality animals our gs was born flown from germany and trained as a guide dog by our swat trainer after years the elderly person could not use her due to her health declining so we kept with k trainer for years now years after her birth she‚Äôs our family member responsible pet owners don‚Äôt contribute to the animals in shelters
my puppy looks very similar i thought she was a german shepherd mix but maybe not
my cat would have shredded my hand and arm to pieces after seconds of all that lovin
oh man my boy cat looooooves belly rubs if he sees you walking toward him he ll roll on his back to get those sweet sweet belly rubs
i volunteer at an animal shelter and i call this move hard pets not all cats like it and they ll let you know if you get too rough however some cats go bonkers for it
my husband pets all cats like dogs he grew up with dogs and didn‚Äôt realize that there was any other way to pet a furry animal other than to scratch it vigorously it makes the vast majority of cats instantly fall in love with him they love to be scratched and he‚Äôs often the first person to really scratch them he‚Äôs since learned other ways to pet cats but since so many cats love to be scratched like dogs that‚Äôs still his go to
my cat loves vigorous petting like this doesn t matter how hard the scritches are she wants more she doesn t care what you re doing she just wants those damn pets
he s got the itches for the scritches my cat goes pretty mental for scratchies when i get home from work
yeah i got a siamese and he bites you if you try snd pet him softly he loves to be patted on the butt like a good boi
ok this makes me miss my chickens and your dog is hilarious buuuuuut what i really like is your user name üòú
i love how i could hear the dogs mouth without having the volume on
this looks like the vr game in one of the webtoons i am reading
it looks like he‚Äôs just selling everything that fell between the couch cushions
buy all the bomb chu s this is the only place that sells them
nip seller i need your most powerful nip for tomorrow i ride into battle
i used to be and adventurer like you then i took a claw to the paw
got a selection of good things on sale stranger wait that s not right is it
it s me garfield the deeeeaaaals warlock would you like to make a zesty deeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaallllll just a few gold and maybe a few vials of your blood all this and more can be yours
this is really freaking me out because three of the five things he‚Äôs offering are on my desk right now i have the switch pro controller that‚Äôs the exact same remote i have and that phone case looks just like mine
how about this one over he not for sale ok what about this on not for sale
i ll take the m magazine or whatever the thing at the right is
that s probably a switchblade on the right but my brain called it a non castrated wiimote so yeah i ll buy that i guess
ah fine choice you seem to have chosen your phone that will cost you treats
we have a good deals on the controller and tv remote but if you want the mouse you can go fuck your self
i love the ‚Äòyou can‚Äôt touch this‚Äô game with my cat unless it involves my clothes it‚Äôs always my clothes
this cat is the cat version of my sister i am s t a r t l e d
yep came here for khajit saw it immediately good show
have you taken it to the vet yet those eyes aren‚Äôt looking too good
aw i have a kitty named pippin too and he s also good and stripey
pippin looks like he has an eye infection might want to take him to the vet
look at his extra toes what a cutie i definitely recommend getting a second opinion on his eyes he looks uncomfortable üò£
see how wise and caring people are and so many see that this little pippin needs meds
we had our pippin girl pass unexpectedly last november she was the same color hoping her playful spirit lives on in yours who i get is a male haha
she is beautiful put a few drops of apple cider vinegar in her water it helps a lot with kitty eye infections
and here i was thinking this would be an uncommon kitty name we ve got a ginger tabby pippin as well hope he adjusts well üòä and you should low key adopt him a brother merry we ve got a pippin merry pair and it just wouldn t feel right otherwise
my parents have an orange tabby with white called pippin he‚Äôs the biggest butthead but i love him
veterinarian here needs some antibiotics in those eyes chlamydophila felis is super common in kitten eyes as well as viral diseases that can cause secondary bacterial infections both can lead to ocular ulcers and loss of eyesight or even eyes allergies in kittens are damn near non existent at that age ‚úåüèª
momma in the background about ready to wreck you should you harm bambi here
awesome day and best capture wish animals just popped up like this were i lived
i love seeing young animals get really curious about humans it‚Äôs so pure
obligatory ‚Äúdeer picture‚Äù comments ‚Äòcongrats on being a disney princess ‚Äô ‚Äòdo you want ticks because that‚Äôs how you get ticks‚Äô
i hope you didn t pet it because otherwise the mother will abandon it
i love mama in the background just keeping an eye on her curious little fawn
they lie down if they re nervous but sometimes it s in the open
wild deer that lack a fear of humans may be infected w chronic wasting disease did mom look fearful and well fed
‚Äúi see you are taking pictures might i offer a subject ‚Äù
you should probably not let fawns thinks humans are nice or this little guy will be the first deer killed come hunting season
absolutely love the look on the cat‚Äôs face ‚Äúshit i‚Äôve been found out ‚Äù
anime be we should just forget about this and pretend it never happened
your kitten should be in a wes anderson movie because she is symmetrical even when she sleeps
she looks like she is giving blessings in her sleep ps it s difficult to think of cats and birds as male
it doesn‚Äôt seem it wants to meet us unworthy bastards
cute cat but you also posted this before and also aren t a lurker
i didn t think i was in that kind of sub ooooooohhh kitten got it my bad i ll just be over here gt
cant figure out how to post on mobile or i would share my kittens
cute kitty i posted a picture of our kitty that looks almost exactly like this and got up doots xd the reddit gods have shunned me p
well of course she s a lurker if she spent less time sleeping she could post more
is this what the new title trend is now mostly a lurker being used so many times
oh my god she looks just like my baby when she was younger
your kitten has all the hallmarks of a meme maker go forth and be fruitful
awwww look at him her a real beauty thanks for sharing
your kitten is so cute my cat looks kinda like your kitten and my cat has blue eyes
what an amazing looking moment and a great looking pic üòÅüòÅüòÅ thank you for sharing
reminds me of tom cruise on the motorcycle in too gun
the song from the cats in lady and the tramp immediately popped into my head
one of them will bite if you pet them the other will pull you in closer for more pets
so cute it‚Äôs a heart shape and they‚Äôre touching paws too
honestly took me a moment to realize it wasn t just a mirrored image
we are siamese if you ease donk donk donk racist going sound
thumbnail looks like a face with the top paw being a nose
why do i feel like some artist will recreate this with anime catgirls
how do you tell them apart it doesn t look like they have collars or is it just one of those instinct things where you just know which one is which
as someone who grew up with siamese cats i wish you all the best they re incredibly smart affectionate and loyal my year old lilac point livia named after caesar augustus s first wife is still very playful affectionate and looouuudd
üéµ we are siamese if you please we are siamese if you don t please üéµ
i like how they re kinda making a heart with their arms that makes it even cuterüòÑ
‚Äú we start fires ‚Äù sorry i had to make this reference or i miss this opportunity
they look so alike i thought this was fake at first i d adopt em
what the hell do you call them if they re joined at the hip that s not redundant ¬Ø „ÉÑ ¬Ø amp nbsp these are the things that keep me awake at night
it looks like a heart where their paws are i can t even with this level of cuteness
these two are incredibly cute the colouring and marking is very special kind of rare no i see the brown short hair ones all the time these two are fluffy
the fact that they form a little heart as they sit next to each other just melts me üò≠üòª
can anyone speak scientifically to the issue of whether they are identical as in have the same dna or fraternal twins how does that work in mammals that have litters given that all litter mates are obviously fraternal at least just curious
two polydactyly siamese cats looks expensive but totally worth it
the way their arms meet has a heart shape in my opinion
so coincidental that they made a heart unintentionally in their act of holding hands ‚ù§Ô∏è
why am i still seeing posts from here i unsubbed because of all the cats
omg at first i thought the pole was a body and they were siamese lol
gotta love meezers those two look like they re already planning some mischief
the beauty of having a smart phone within reach most of the time you can capture these moments how many i wasted running around looking for a camera
so tonight i‚Äôll hit the window blinds while you knock shit off any counter top you can find we‚Äôll meet up so we can sit on their heads as they try to sleep
what cuties lt i hear siamese cats don t shed much does anyone know if that s true
i m curious do you keep your severed heads in a separate freezer or with the rest of your food
i just let out such a loud awww which wouldn t so bad except i m in a practically silent waiting room at an eye doctor s office üò≤ jasper is so incredibly adorable
my heart just melted what breed is jasper looks sort of like a klee kai
happy for the pupper and to give this post its thousanth upvote
"my name in real life is jasper i am proud of this dog for sharing my namesake i am also pretending these comments are about me and it is good thanks
jasper"
awww he s so adorable would let him drown me in kisses times
what s in his lost eye looks like beans he s still adorable though with the fluffy fur and the toe beans
why don‚Äôt you get the eye removed he would look better i think
happy birthday tell him he s handsome for me please
he looks like he has an existential crisis finally he has all he ever wanted and is still not happy there is nothing that will fill that void
it‚Äôs a decent photoshop but every element just screams fake
if only we could all go to doggy daycare every day what fun we d have chasing the other dogs fetching balls barking at everything that moves swimming cuddling sitting on another dog s head licking the counselors
this is usually the same reaction i have when looking at my bank account balance
aww he looks lonely he needs another dog to splash with
i bet he doesn t pee in the pool like nasty humans do
imagine serving the king until being betrayed by your student to close it off being reborn as a cat
brandon the broken is really taking advantage of his new found royalty
that‚Äôs what bran was doing all of season warging into this cat
if you didn t read this in the voice of john hurt you done missed out
my son‚Äôs wizard cat is named merlin but mostly he‚Äôs just an asshole
any idea what caused his blindness is he getting around okay what did the vet say
merlin would scare the shit out of me if i woke up to him at the edge of my bed ‚Äúhey hooman wanna play ‚Äù
is he blind is that why he has no pupils or am i just dumb
it felt like he was staring right through my freaking soul dude
although he can‚Äôt see me he‚Äôs looking in to my soul and i love him
merlin is a majestic name my mainstream arse would have called him storm
reminded me i still need to watch pet sematary thanks
dammit bran you re supposed to be looking for a bloody dragon not playing with a kitten
speak to me mews of the adventurous man who wandered long after he sacked the sacred citadel of troy
oh my that s going to be making an appearance in my dreams
was he born a blind wizard or does he have glaucoma or something
can you fake asses stop posting disfigured or sickly looking animals to this sub we get it you re very deep for seeing the beauty in hideous things very special but stop patting yourselves on the back already
this is nathaniel amp elliot green s cat his instagram is merlin griffith üòä
hey op idk if u know there s this cool character in seven deadly sins named merlin cheers
i know all the roads they all lead to the same letterbox
hey op how‚Äôs the cat doing does she need a lot of guidance and what not def a beauty
your cat is fucking scary but i like it i just don t want to see it in real life you should make the picture with a sephia or black and white look
remember that time before i saw this picture and i still had a soul i miss those days
i have a merlin also and his sister nimue he‚Äôs gorgeous
as much as i like cats this is not adorable this would be fucking horrifying to see walking up to you from a dark hallway
this creature is beautiful please tell me is kitten sighted or not
i feel like this picture was taken seconds before lightning struck and the room was filled with tuna
those piercing blue eyes so cute i would die for merlin
she looks like she s either blind or the god of thunder
should have named him lucifer that would be sooo cool
there was a book series called the lost years of merlin in the books merlin is blind i wonder if the kitten was named for that
the name is fitting he seems like a wizard or the pet of a wizard
he looks like hes warging something and if you get it you get it
bran stop pissing about and get the fuck out of that cat you ve got six kingdoms to preside over you whimsical bastard
for anybody interested in merlin he has an instagram merlin griffith he‚Äôs a cute fellow and is taken care of by his two dads elliot and nathaniel green
real damn cute in the daylight but would creep me out to wake up with this fluffy fucker on my chest at am staring into my soul
might be a stupid question but they are blind right the blue eyes and black fur are so cute together o
was anyone else reminded of the cover of billie eilish s new album
for anyone asking merlin is an instagram cat owned by elliot and nathanial green follow him at merlin griffith üôÇ
looks more like the lego wizard from the lego movie
i ve seen things you people wouldn t believe attack ships on fire off the shoulder of orion i watched c beams glitter in the dark near the tannh√§user gate
woah that s pretty cool i mean not for mr fluffy but you know
what a gorgeous cat dumb question but before i assume he is blind right
he totally looks like bran when he‚Äôs warging in got
i‚Äôd name him after the king in lotr and then smother him with love until he tried to wriggle away to which i‚Äôd respond ‚Äúyou have no power here‚Äù
fetch me the catnip stone adventurer and i will bestow on you gold

he looks like he is going to steal my heart in a good way and a bad way
she does kinda look like anubis she s a pretty pup i bet she picks up some serious long range radio waves
she‚Äôs gonna be able to hear treats from a really far distance
where did you find that i have a couple cats and a ferret that would go crazy for that
okay this is adorable then they get even more excited when toy starts scooting around the room
what a great toy wonder what it‚Äôs called would love to get one
that one in the back wants to understand how this works forget the childish swatting she s gonna be a scientist
wacky waving arm flailing inflatable tube man wacky waving arm flailing inflatable tube man wacky waving arm flailing inflatable tube man come to al harrington‚Äôs wacky waving arm flailing inflatable tube man emporium and warehouse
me wow cats are so easily entertained also me watching cat gif four times
those cats are attacking dee but i shouldn t be surprised she is a bird after all stupid bird
am i the only one who noticed that they must be declawed for this to happen
so invisible giant cats make them wacky waving interesting
nice work setting that up to distract them from the lego build in the back ground
when you beat the boss and then it goes to second level and starts moving around
i was just about to close the gif and scroll on when it fell over and started fighting back laughed my ass off
i was thinking ‚Äúoh that looks kinda fun‚Äù but then it got knocked over and that just took it to my cats need one of these immediately
your cats are so gentle my cats would destroy that thing
you d really vaccinate your dog wow it s like you want it to have autism i can t even with you people sometimes smh

that one eye is working double time on the sad kitty look
he s very cute but please tell me you named him willie
the surgeon i assume did an awesome job i don t often see eye injuries heal that neatly
r piratepets as a lover of a one eyed buddy i loved this sub
please tell me you dress him up as a pirate for halloween

i‚Äôd give the utmost unconditional love and spoil him rotten what a handsome charming boy
what u looking at kitty me aww shit someone wants a headscratchin meet me under the flagpole at pm for a nice bellyrub u beautiful thing u üòò
pretty sure that s odin in cat form probably lost a drinking bet with freya
beautiful is the perfect word because it only has one i
my little girl has the opposite eye but looks just like yours üòç‚ù§Ô∏è
he looks like puss in boots missing an eye hes so adorable
that s what you call a special boi but the look is no different from any other kitty iz to cute
awe üòªnothing better then an orange tabby he is a beautiful guy i have a kitty with both eyes missing he gets around just fine he uses his other senses and he‚Äôs our beautiful boy
hanbit is so adorable plus they look exactly like my one eyed boi
it s almost unnatural how well it healed like wow he looks handsome
who needs depth perception when you got looks to kill
i would risk my own eyes to kiss him right on that gorgeous mouth
hai yai forces hope i m not the only berserk fan here
beautiful no adorable yes beauty is a metric being adorable inspires great affection tbh it s much better to be the latter
is it weird that i want to scritch where his eye was
very cute kitty but may i ask what happened to his right eye
i guess that kittie would have been too perfect with two eyes üòçü§§
he s a good looking boi very expressive face make sure he gets all the cuddles
we have a cat who looks exactly like this that s been missing for a couple of weeks now i miss you gus
this post was right under a post about a cg eyeball i think really they just stole it from this cat
no sarcasms thank you for not posting this with the you may think he s ugly but i love him karma farming tagline used with disabled disfigured pets
he keeps muttering about a lord of light and the night being full of terrors
boss that was amazing that right there is why you re the best boss the one and only
that s what happens when puss n boots kept playing with knives and swords
i love that cat even though it doesn t have depth perception cute fuzzball
holy crap did you adopt this boy in pennsylvania providence animal center i‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs one of our cats that was adopted out or fostered recently i volunteer there he was really shy
how is there hair in the eyehole for humans wouldn t their just be an empty cavity that you would have to cover
am i the only one who s feed had this picture right above the gif of the cgi eyeball it was very disconcerting
he reminds me of the pirate cat from the last unicorn
he is so stinkin cute that one eye is soooo big and beautiful
im getting the chills the other eye is gone still cute
puss in boots really got fcked up in that lil scuffle
you accidentally posted the photoshopped version op
i m surprised the mods haven t deleted this yet as sad content even tho this is an awesome inspirational murder beast
pirates like this boy make me really wish i could talk to animals he‚Äôs gotta have some great tales and viewpoints
he s not missing an eye he just has a permanent wink
shame humans with slight disabilities don‚Äôt get the love simplistic animals do
i may be downvoted tremendously for this but why is there always a comment of do beautiful gorgeous when an animal has one eye the majority of posts that talk about how beautiful an animal is they always seem to have a f ked up feature why its like a normal thing now
you can t tease us with this and not even tell us his name
sales mr mcgill sales and what do i sell the truth every blessed word of it from genesee on down to revelations that s right the word of god which let me tell you there is damn good money in during these times of woe and want people are lookin for answers and big dan sells the only book that s got em and what do you do you and your tongue tied friend
i immediately seen him holding his hat in his hands lol puss in boots
poor baby but so darn adorable i hope he lives a happy and fulfilling life with you
give him an eye patch and he looks like that ferret fucker from ice age
awww he s purr fectly handsome he ll look real classy in a monocle eye absolutely adore him
so my cat had glaucoma and lost all vision out of one eye but the vet said the pressure is down so it doesn‚Äôt bother him anymore he can‚Äôt see out of it but i‚Äôve been trying to decide if i should get it removed for him or just let it be vet said it‚Äôs fine with no pressure anyone have personal experience either way thanks
what on earth made you think anyone would want to see a one eyed cat
what a trooper hug him lots for me and give him lots of kisses
he looks like that one dude from ice age with the leaf eye patch
looks like he woke up one morning married to a pineapple an ugly pineapple but he loved her
that s the real life version of puss in boots when he puts his cute face on the adorable nature of this photo is too damn high
give me a second eye i need to get my story straight
is it wrong i would like a button in the place of nothing
the last time he trusted someone he lost an eye üòÇ üòçüòº
just like my little girl she lost her left eye due to an infection while homeless i remember walking into the adoption center and an older woman just talking absolute shit about her how ugly she is i wanted to kick that woman in the face but in the end i settled for adopting my pumpkin dumpling
eye love him forever and he d be cute with a little eye patch
just speaking from history here but non symmetry is ok not good definitely bad but i wouldn t kill this cat at first sight
i also was owned by a one eyed beautiful boy once smartest cat that ever owned me i miss him so much
did that cat not listen to ralph s father and play with the bb gun
looks a bit like my old pirate kitty when i was a kid that lost his eye to a stray baseball that cat had waaaay more than lives
i love cats a lot i truly think that the right cat can make you happy till the end
when i was little we had a cat named shadow who had no eyes he had a massive infection when he was a kitten that cost him both eyes before we adopted him and he was deaf in one ear he was the coolest companion i ve ever had he was so full of life he couldn t see and could barely hear but he was always around ready to play and wrestle he lived to be almost i loved that old boy
that s an ugly disfigured cat why are we pretending that we think it s beautiful lmao
looks exactly like my cat except for the missing eye
put an eye patch on and he would look exactly like puss in boots
give him a little patch and dress him like a pirate for halloween
does this beautiful kitty have an ig account i just need to know what happens in his daily life please
if my kitty had one eye i would have so much fun scaring her around corners haha
this cat is not beautiful posts like this are so stupid
please tell me that cat was photographed mid blink lmao
i had a one eyed cat a few years ago biggest sweetheart in the world also liked being scratched in his eye socket which was a little weird
i swear every time i see a cat here i fall more in love with it than the last cat i am a hopeless romantic
he reminds me of buck from ice age obscure reference
hours plissken youve got hours to get in rescue the president and escape from new york
they say dogs are better at looking after their owners but that cat ll really keep an eye out for you
he looks like one hell of a pirate cat captain hella badass
wtf is with the one eyed animals on reddit i strongly dislike it they‚Äôre cute but like uncomfortable
deformities or irregularities ‚â† cute theres nothing wrong with the cat but all these animals that are physically deformed by any metric get upvoted just because they have a disability when of the time they re not physically adorable
awesome cat pls put a big googly eye on him and report back
it looks like a pirate cat had kid with an angel one reminds me of thor instead nick fury lol he s beautiful btw
kwazii at least how i thought kwazii would look if he didn t just use the eye patch for show
this guy needs an eye patch for full pirate mode asap
righteye exe has stopped responding close the program
i demand an eyepatch for this cat the only good thing about missing one eye is that you get to wear an eyepatch
hopefully this cat will see this post and gain a little self confidence beautiful kitty
is it common for an eye socket to be closed over in surgery if the eye is removed i assume the eye was lost due to injury or infection is this ever done to people when they lose an eye i m totally ignorant of this kind of thing
my cat looks identical missing the same eye and everything his doppelganger
reminds me of that eyepatch wearing ferret guy from ice age
why do i suddenly want a one eyed cat üò• that s one hella cute and unique cat
i don t know if it s because the other one is missing but that eye looks anime huge this guys ridiculously cute
he s a little bit asymetric but otherwise very nice cat
that has healed startling well almost off putting how natural that looks as if cats were designed to have the one eye
i have a one eyed dog and know how special these little guys are much love to you and your kittums
glad to see the cat is alive and healthy buuuut it looks kind of ugly amp x b i m not attacking the owner or the cat and the quality of appearance is objective but from my perception it is unappealing and slightly gross slightly
i have a one eyed lilbean too i call him patchy which a lil bit too on the nose
he is defines a beautiful boy has the same colorization as my eyeless wonder kitty i‚Äôm curious if her eyes would have been the same color
he‚Äôs missing something but i just can‚Äôt seem to put my eye on it beautiful cat though
why does this remind me of that guy from iceage with the eyepatch
you should have done the winking üòâ emoji instead of the heart eyes üòç emoji for accuracy
i had a one eyed cat named misha from ages to he was my best friend i loved him so much his eye socket would often itch and i d help him scratch it poor lil feller
its cool that the dna of the cat lets fur grow over the eye socket even continuing the pattern above the eyes down over the socket any biologists know how this work i thought that the dna gives specific instructions for where hair can and can t grow so how does it grow over the eye socket
my cat has one eye too it s amazing how well cats can do with only one
missing some hardware but looks like he makes up for it in heartware
pirate cat sails the seven meowssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
who hurt him yes i am mad don t even like cats but this makes me mad lil guy just trying to live and this happened
cat feet are just about the cutest thing in the whole world i don t go aaawww when i see a baby or a puppy but cat feet melt
puss is that you buddy what happened to your hat and sword
i have a little buddy at work just like this he‚Äôs a sweet boy
he s super cute and super scared please hug and love immediately
he may be missing an eye but he is still a whole baby
wow this is very interesting was this cat born with only eye it doesn t look like there ever was one there
omg he s puss in boots please put an eyepatch on and take another photo please

permanent wink this guy is gonna get all the ladies
he has the same look as the cat in shrek only in real life what a sweetie
not uhh not expecting to cry this early in the evening but okay
puss and boots over here lost an eye what a hansom boi he is anyways
maybe i ve been watching too much octonauts with my son but he reminds me of kwazii beautiful precious boy ‚ù§Ô∏è
what a precious gem of amazingness he is seriously a gift that has been given to you treat him welll because he deserves nothing but the best
i had a padidle growing up she was a sweetie but made some bad distance judgement from time to time
i don t know what this cats name is but if i had the chance to adopt him i d name him sauron
he is beautiful he has a very nice face i love his pink nose
my dad had two one eyed cats the older one was named willie after a pirate in goonies and the other was named after smee a pirate in hook
that cat is completely fucked up i‚Äôd put that poor fella to sleep so he doesn‚Äôt have to suffer any longer and get the kids a nice cute kitten with all of his pieces in tact that they can love and cherish
eye see something is missing eye just cant figure out what
my grandma has a cat that looks just like that the only difference is he has blue eyes but he‚Äôs also a boy his name is milo and he looks exactly like this with a blue eye i‚Äôm gonna save this and show my grandma when we visit she‚Äôll be so happy üíñüòä
sorry but this reminds me of the movie i ve age did you die sadly yes gasps but i survived
kind of looks like the puss in boots so cute very wholesome
flaws are what make you perfect this is guy gal is beyond perfecto
most beautiful did you know orange coloured cats are more rare than any other cat other than albino you got yourself a rare cat right there his special one eye only makes him more special
i love the colouring this would have been my own at this age seconds before she barfed on me
after a day full of downvotes at least this made it a little better
is anyone distracted by the inside of the nostrils it s so red
it looks like the pupper is taking the selfie and i love it
this clip is entirely way too short please upload longer clip
this was litteraly one of the most upvotes posts on this site how dare you repost this
seri√∂s question is a dog smile indicative of anything i thought this was just something there faces did sometimes still cute as hell but i‚Äôm just wondering
kinda looks like the pupper is taking a road trip selfie video
i want to buy that puppy a puppy give him a cookie from us
‚Äúwas up frenz it me doggo am go on trip wiff grampa gonna chase so many geese ‚Äù
thank you for not making this a that damned smile meme not once have i found that meme funny
this needs a batman cartoon soundeffect and then the opening riff of staying alive at the strut
plot twist he‚Äôs been working on gathering the courage for hours and slipped off then played it off like a boss
i know i‚Äôm fucked up but i wanna know how far tom brady could throw that caf
for a moment i thought the fluffer would fall smack on his face brave little guy knew what he was doing
the leap of faith from spiderman into the spiderverse
genuine new redditor question why all the comments but no upvotes are comments better
so mom told me i ll land on my feet anyway here goes nothing
little dude is going to be one hell of a jumper when he is older
oh god i just adopted an week old kitten and she has absolutely no fear within an hour of bringing her home she was already jumping climbing on and off my bed and couch xd
i was expecting a tiny sploot but i got a heck of a big strut for such a tiny cat i m melting üòç
i m pretty sure kittens do not have good depth perception but luckily it was just a smol jump
i would like to see this in slow motion hims so tiny
cats and kittens are nimbler thank pups and doggos really autocorrect i thought it would be nimblier i like nimblier better more fluid
oh my goodness what a precious and brave little furball
i love how it just kind of went ‚Äòsplat‚Äô when it landed gt lt
imagine if you could just jump of a house and be like ploof
god i love when they still have the lil bumpercar tails
looks like a lovable little trouble maker he seems so confident with himself
i have a video of my kitty jumping off the couch like that lol superman style
who the heck is giving out gold so much in multiple threads today lol
if you weighed the same as marshmallow and was covered in a furball you could probably do that too
the last kitten we got was tiny like that and it still had the milk belly aka fat lil tummy we named her bonsai as she would climb up high and jump off whatever she climbed on the funny thing is she never landed on her feet her tummy always hit first she grew out of it eventually
already picturing you laying on the floor and your face
that right there is going to be trouble of the bestest kind
i hate to be a downer but make sure you lessen their fall somehow jumping down everyday multiple times from that height can seriously add up to injuries over time
omg that s like my isabella my roommate took her mom in and we realized she was pregnant within a couple weeks after she had the kittens the sole girl of the litter was the first one to figure out that she could leave the whelping box she s been unstoppable ever since üíñüíñüíñüíñ
little floof is gonna be a hell raiser when they grow up
feral cats have had kittens in my backyard i‚Äôve watched them jumping from a tree they don‚Äôt jump as much as plop like a bunch of adorable apples so cute
if that kitten is anything like my own he made an adorable squeak as he jumped or landed
insert something cute and catchy related to the video of a cute kitty jumping off a couch amp x b can i get gold now please i ve never had any
that cat is going places i don t know where but it s going places
cats always land on their feet or in this case do a little sploot
that cat is so tiny it jumps with the same laws of gravity as a spider
you should limit this i had a kitten about that age that would jump from my couch a lot he hurt his diaphragm really bad and passed away
he ll be residing on top of the refrigerator in no time
the cat that thinks i can jump off anything is the cat that dies to fall damage
the second day after i got my cat at roughly weeks he too had confidence and jumped off the back of the couch spraining his paw fun way to spend the first getting a tiny little kitten sling
ahhhhh triangle tail my favorite stage of kittenhood
you should be worried about this lil dude he s going to own you and yiur house when he gets bigger
punt it like a football to make it not so confident
the one to watch for on the top of everything when it gets a little bigger heh
strong decisive immediate action that i can respect üê±
when he jumps down and hits the ground like bowser aw yeeee
he don‚Äôt know where he‚Äôs going but he‚Äôs going somewhere
what‚Äôs with all the gold is this the same guy that‚Äôs been giving people platinum
that was my indy the day i snatched him up from my vet my last cat rip rotten had just passed and i needed another like it was heroin picked him up you know giving him a little test drive and he immediately sorta slid out of my hands and onto my shoulder and less than one second later he s flying from feet up legs splayed out no fear i think yep he s the one and i ve had him for years now
is this the post where everyone gets a gold am i at the right place
at this age a human kid will be like what am i doing in here anyways
it s like if you angrily threw a cotton ball at the ground
those eyes are so big definitely got a bunch of crazy kitty energy going on it‚Äôs attack time
that cats expression looks like it‚Äôs seeing a mf demon
"me basically slapping my phone on my husbands face
me look at this cat look at it"
my cat does the same expression when i‚Äôm trying to grab his belly lol
those kicks are deadly gotta be careful when going for the tummy
pretty sure he doesn‚Äôt like you going for his belly like that
not to be insensitive but does he she cat okay like getting around jumping and general cat nonsense
aw such a cutie glad he s happy and content and that he loves face cuddles
let‚Äôs just take a moment to appreciate all the animal owners who take in disabled elderly or just generally ‚Äòundesirable‚Äô animals you guys are the real mvp‚Äôs
could you imagine placing googly eyes there he d be so adorable not that he isn t already
one second before he swipes his small paw with tiny knives attached across your face
your buddy miles looks extremely like my buddy miso
hey there georgie boy what a cutie glad he has a great new home with a great dad
